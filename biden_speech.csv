Please welcome back to the stage, Lady Gaga. (31:05)
Please welcome business agent for Laborers’ Union Local 1058, John Duffy. (35:07)
Whoa. Hello, Pittsburgh. I’m Jill Biden’s husband and Lady Gaga’s friend. We go back a while. One thing I wasn’t going to say, but I’ll said now, she spent a lot of time helping me with the Violence Against Women Act and helping so many women who needed help. God love you, you’re wonderful. Thank you, thank you, thank you.(36:14)
Folks. John, thanks, old buddy, for sharing your story. And thanks to Mr. Mayor. I don’t know where you are, I can’t see out here, but I’ll tell you what, thanks for the passport into town. And thanks for all the speakers we heard tonight, as well as the incredible, as I said, Lady Gaga. I don’t know whether … You couldn’t see, but all my grandkids are over there, Lady Gaga. And when you were singing, knew every word of every song. They were jumping and moving. I got to get a picture with them. Anyway.(36:49)
My buddy Congressman Mike Doyle, Governor Tom Wolf, thank you for standing with me and fighting for the dignity of working people. Everyone you’ve heard from across the state, as well as in Philadelphia, we hear you loud. We hear clearly. Congressman Boyle been with me a while. Remarkable, great friend and friend of his family. His dad and I grew up five blocks away from one another in Scranton.(37:18)
Bobby Casey, Patti LaBelle, and John Legend. My Lord, John, I’m voting for you after I heard that speech you made. Look at the second future gentleman, Doug. Doug, I love you. You are a good man. And I want to thank the next vice president of the United States, a woman I am so proud to be running alongside of, Kamala Harris.(37:46)
Look, I know as a Scranton boy and then raised on the border of Southern Pennsylvania in Claymont, Delaware, I know it’s not always easy to bring Western and Eastern Pennsylvania together. But you know what, the Steelers got a big win yesterday, and the Eagles got a big win last night, so we can both be happy. And folks, I have a feeling we’re coming together for a big win tomorrow.(38:24)
My Lord, there’s a lot of you out here on this cold night. Thank you. And by the way, in the parking garage, don’t jump. I need you. Don’t jump.(38:33)
Folks, look, 18 months ago, we kicked off the campaign at Teamsters Local 249 right here in Pittsburgh. I chose Western Pennsylvania for my first stop as a candidate, and now for my last stop before Election Day, because you represent the backbone of this country. Hard work and families. We’re asking nothing but a fair shot, an even chance. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. The qualities that built this country, that created and sustain the middle class. And by the way, as I said twice earlier today, unions built the middle class.(39:19)
Look. We’ve been through a lot in this country since we announced. America is facing a confluence of crises unlike anything in living memory. We’re still in the battle for the soul of America. Decency, honor, respect. Where has it gone with this president? Let me tell you something, folks. Tomorrow’s the beginning of a new day. Tomorrow we can put an end to a presidency that has left hardworking Americans out in the cold. Tomorrow we can put an end to a presidency that has divided this nation and fanned the flames of hate. Tomorrow we can put an end to a presidency that has failed to protect this nation.(40:10)
Ladies and gentlemen, millions of Americans have already voted. Close to a hundred million. And millions more will vote tomorrow. And my message to you is simple: the power to change this country is in your hands. In your hands. I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries, there’s nothing, nothing that’s going to stop the people of this nation from voting, period. And when America votes, America will be heard. And America’s heard. I believe the message to be loud and clear, it’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. I honest to God believe the vast majority of Americans are done with the chaos, the corruption, the failure, the irresponsibility, the indifference to American lives, the indifference to America’s dignity. We’ve got a lot of work to do. Not division and distraction, but real, real, real healing of this country.(41:25)
If you elect me your president, I’m going to heal this country, and we’re going to act. We’re going to act to get COVID under control beginning on day one. I’ll put in action a plan I’ve been talking about for months. Masking, social distancing, testing, tracing. A plan for full and fair and free distribution of therapeutics and a vaccine, when it comes.(41:51)
Imagine where we could be if the president only wore a mask from the beginning instead of mocked it. I can tell you this, as every expert will tell you, we wouldn’t have 9 million COVID cases in this nation. We wouldn’t have over 230,000 deaths and nearly a hundred thousand cases nationwide just two days ago. We wouldn’t be facing another 200,000 predicted deaths in the next few months. That’s what the experts are telling us. We don’t change, 200,000 more people will die by the end of the year.(42:31)
The President knew in January, as Kamala said, that this virus was deadly, but he hid it from the American people. He knew it was worse than the flu, but he lied to us. He knew it wasn’t going to disappear. He kept telling us a miracle was coming, it’d be over by Easter.(42:50)
Last Friday, he had the gall to suggest that America’s doctors, who’ve been on the front lines of this crisis for nine months along with the nurses and so many other first responders, he suggested those doctors were falsely inflating the deaths due to COVID because they wanted more money. For God’s sake. No, I really mean it. Think about it. Our frontline healthcare workers, they’ve suffered and sacrificed for nine months, and this president is questioning their character, their integrity, their commitment to their fellow Americans. It’s a disgrace. And last night, Trump went on to say he was going to fire Dr. Fauci. Well, I’ve got a better idea. Let’s fire Trump, and I’ll hire Fauci.(43:43)
Think about it. Look, Donald Trump has waved the white flag of surrender. Remember he said, “I’m the commander- in-chief, and I’m going to fight this fight.” Give me a break. He waved the white flag of surrender. I’ll never surrender. We’re going to beat this virus. We’re going to get it under control. And the first step to beating this virus is beating Donald Trump.(44:22)
Folks. Well, let me tell you something. Donald Trump keeps telling us what a great jobs president he is. As we say in my faith, bless me, Father, for he has … I don’t know. Jobs president. Here’s the truth. Donald Trump is going to be the first president in 90 years, that’s a lot of presidents, the first president in 90 years to finish his term in office with fewer jobs than when he started. An independent analysis, not from some liberal think tank, but by Moody’s, a Wall Street firm, projects that my plan will create 7 million more jobs and a trillion dollars more economic growth than anything the President has proposed.(45:17)
Folks, we can do this. I’m going to end Trump’s tax loopholes that incentivize companies to ship jobs overseas. That’s why there’s not as many jobs here. And I’m going to add a 10% surtax on any company that ships jobs overseas. But companies who invest in American manufacturing, bring jobs back, we’ll give them a 10% tax credit.(45:47)
And by the way, president of the United States awards about over $600 billion of contracts a year because of everything from building aircraft carriers to all that we do, all the government spends. I promise you this, and it violates no trade agreement, there will be no government contracts given out on my watch that don’t make all of their products here in America. The future will be right here in America, in Pennsylvania.(46:26)
Folks, Trump sees the world from Park Avenue, from Wall street. That’s all he can see. Well, I see it from Scranton, where I grew up. I see it from Pennsylvania and Delaware. Wall Street didn’t build this country; working people built the country, the middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class.(46:55)
My dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joe, the only way you can deal with the abuse of power is with power.” Well, the only outfit that can deal with the abuse of power of corporate America are union power. That’s the only way it can be dealt with. And I warn you all, if I’m elected, you’re going to see the most pro-union president in American history sitting in the White House.(47:24)
Look. I believe we should be about rewarding work, not wealth. Under my plan, as Kamala said, if you make less than 400,000 bucks, you’re not going to pay a penny more in taxes. But finally, finally, the wealthiest among us, the biggest corporations, 91 of which of the Fortune 500 paid zero in income tax, you’re going to start paying your fair share. Why? Why should an iron worker, a firefighter, an educator, a nurse pay at a higher tax rate than the super wealthy?(48:08)
Folks, and here’s a good one, why should you be paying more than Donald Trump pays in taxes? New York Times said he paid $750 in taxes one year. And guess what. When they asked him about it a little before that, he said the reason he only paid that is because he was smart, he knew how to game the system. Well, I’m sick of the wealthy guys gaming the system. Most are willing to pay their fair share, but let me tell you …(48:55)
By the way, he loves to talk about corruption. Oh, my Lord. He loves to talk about corruption. And you found out last week, he’s the only person I’ve ever heard of has a secret bank account in China where he paid, according to the Times, 50 times more taxes in Beijing than he did in the United States. Folks, as my mother would’ve said, enough is enough is enough. Look. We’re going to act to protect healthcare as well. Trump and the Republicans for the last 10 years have been trying like the devil to eliminate the healthcare plan. By the way, because of economic policies and so many companies going out of business, 10 million Americans have already lost their healthcare.(49:54)
And now Trump and the Republicans, they jam through a Supreme Court nominee for one overwhelming reason: they wanted to destroy the Affordable Care Act. If they get their way, by the way … This is not hyperbole. By the way, guess what’s going to happen. Seven days after tomorrow, they’re going to be in the Supreme Court arguing to wipe out, root and branch, all of the Affordable Care Act. Well, you can say that again because a lot of people are hurting.(50:27)
I can remember as a kid growing up in Claymont and Wilmington in a three-bedroom house, nice house, three-bedroom, split-level home with four kids and a grandpa. The walls were thin. I can remember one night, my dad, I could hear him restless in the room next to us, talking to my mom, and asking her the next morning, “What’s the matter?” She said, “Your dad, we just lost our health insurance.” How many people you know, staring at the ceiling, wondering what in God’s name are they going to do without health insurance? How many of them? How many …(51:03)
… without health insurance, how many of them? How many of them are worried like we were when our son came home from Iraq and was lying dying? I wonder what I would have done had they been able to come in, but for Obamacare and say, “Sorry, sorry, suffer the last month in the hospital in peace without your insurance, you’ve outrun your insurance.” How many people do you know? And many of you worry about it, worry about your kids, worry about what’s happening. Well, if they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose protections for pre-existing conditions, including five million Pennsylvanians. It’s wrong. It’s wrong. Donald Trump, look, folks, being a great consumer of healthcare I feel very strongly about this. Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege. I think it’s a right.(52:10)
I’ll not only restore healthcare, I’ll build on it. You can keep your private insurance if you have it, or you can choose a Medicare like option. We’re going to increase subsidies to lower your premiums and deductibles, out of pocket spending, surprise billings. How are you going to do that? Because Trump and his buddies are going to pay more taxes so you don’t have to do more. And we’re going to reduce, if it didn’t sound so strange I wouldn’t even explain, you’re going to reduce prescription drug costs by 60%. You know how? By making sure Medicare can negotiate with the insurance companies for the cost of drugs. We’re going to make sure you keep the protections for pre-existing conditions. Meanwhile, these guys are for real, unfortunately.(53:10)
Meanwhile, Trump’s announced what he’ll do if he gets re-elected with regard to social security. The actuary of social security has said if Trump were elected and gets passed what he wants it will bankrupt social security by 2023. Now, you all may think I’m making it up. But just like I said when Paul Ryan was the Speaker of the House. I said, “They’re going to cut Medicare,” and everybody looked, “No, no.” They tried to cut it by $5 billion right off the bat. Folks, these guys are serious. They’ve never fully supported these programs. I’ll protect social security, Medicare and Medicaid. You have my word on it. But folks, as we used to say in the Senate, if you excuse a point of personal privilege, there’s nothing that has made me more angry about this President than the way he’s spoken about those of you have served in uniform. Losers and suckers, he referred to you.(54:25)
Our son, Beau, his two children are with me tonight, he gave up his job as Attorney General to volunteer to go to Iraq for a year. He won the Bronze Star, the Speaker’s Service Medal, he came home with brain cancer. And guess what? He wasn’t a sucker. He was a patriot like all of your sons and daughters. It angers the hell out of me the way he talks about our veterans. Your parents, your grandparents, all who have served. To the best of my knowledge, he’s the first President of the United States who has six generals and admirals who worked in his administration who have since left and said he was unfit to be Commander-in-Chief. Folks, that’s my General Stanley McChrystal, a former commander of special operations who oversaw the Bin Laden raid, Admiral Bill McRaven, and 22 other four stars endorsed me because they know I’ll have their back.(55:45)
It’s not happened before. Trump likes to portray himself as a tough guy, the macho man. Wouldn’t you like to have a shot? Anyway, the macho man. And he says people listen to him because he’s tough around the world. When’s the last time you ever heard of a President of the United States literally being laughed out loud by world leaders when he spoke with United Nations? So much for listening to him. When was the last time a President of the United States met with the NATO leaders at the NATO Summit, other world leaders, chancellors, presidents, prime ministers, and before they realize it, they were all making fun of him as he left the room? Folks, and can you believe we have a President who acts like Vladimir Putin’s puppy? Putin put bounties on the heads of American soldiers in Afghanistan, where I’ve been to many times. It’s a rough area, man.(56:56)
But Trump has talked to him six times since then and he’s been frightened to say or challenge him at all. Donald Trump isn’t strong, he’s weak. This is a President who not only does it not understand sacrifice, doesn’t understand courage, physical courage it takes to be in uniform. Folks, we’re going to support our military. They’re the backbone and spine of this country. Folks, we have to vote to meet the challenge of climate crisis. Donald Trump calls it a hoax. I call it about our health and the ability to create millions of good paying jobs right here in Western Pennsylvania. We can combat climate change with American ingenuity and manufacturing, creating millions of new high paying union jobs. Let me be clear, I will not ban fracking in Pennsylvania. I’ll protect those jobs, period, no matter what Donald Trump says. But I tell you what, I will, I will no longer fund oil companies with subsidies, period.(58:17)
Folks, we have to restore the backbone of this country, but we also have to unify. Look, we’re going to act to deliver racial justice in America. Protesting is not burning and looting. The violence will not be tolerated. But the protests, there’s a cry for justice. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, Walter Wallace, they’re not going to be soon forgotten by me, not by anyone in this country. And they’re going to inspire a new wave of justice in America. When I met with Floyd’s family, when I went down to Texas, he has a little daughter, six years old, and I was in the room and I knelt down to talk to her. She looked at me and she said, “Mr. Vice President,” she said, “my daddy is going to change America. My daddy is going to change America.” Well, guess what? We also know that the American people realize we’ve got to change. We also know that justice isn’t just about criminal justice, it’s about knowing the true justice about jobs and building wealth for your families. No one should be working two jobs to stay in poverty. We need a minimum of $15 an hour minimum wage. And for people struggling, first term home buyers, they’re going to get a $15,000 tax credit from me. We’re going to provide capital for young entrepreneurs to start small businesses, provide free community college, which by the way, costs a lot of money, six billion a year. We spend about that much money giving breaks out for race horses, folks, as well as free tuition for students attending state universities if they come from families making less than 125 grand. Folks, we can do this, Pennsylvania. In 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in me and Barack. In 2020, I’m asking you seeking your trust again. I take nothing for granted.(01:00:53)
This is a battle for the soul of America. We have to win this. We have to win this together. Bring the country together. I’m proud of the coalition this campaign has built, welcoming Democrats and Republicans and independents. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American President. There will be no red states and blue states. There’ll be the United States of America. I promise you I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. That’s the job of a President, the duty to care for everyone, the duty to heal. That’s the President’s job. So please vote. If you still have your absentee ballot, get into a drop box as soon as you can or vote tomorrow in person. Just make a plan and help get out the vote. The power is in your hands, Pennsylvania.(01:02:12)
And here’s the amazing thing, here’s the amazing thing about this moment in our history, the character of the country is on the ballot. On the one hand, we’re facing the biggest threats to who we are and what we believe that we’ve seen in our lifetimes. But on the other hand, our future has never been more promising. I’ve said it many times. I’m more optimistic about America’s future today than I was when I got invited and got elected as a 29 year old kid. And here’s why, we’re in a better position than any nation in the world to lead the 21st century. Fact, our workers are three times as productive. We have the biggest economy in the world, the strongest military in the history of the world, the most innovative entrepreneurs. We’re virtually energy dependent. We have more great research universities, out of which every major new changes come, than all the rest of the world combined, literally.(01:03:23)
No nation in the world can match us. We lead by the power of our example, not just example of our power. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. No one else can challenge us. And that’s exactly what Donald Trump has been doing from the beginning of this campaign, dividing America, tearing us apart, pitting Americans against one another based on our race, our gender, our ethnicity, our religion. It’s wrong. That’s not who we are. And folks, everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s keep showing them who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lie after lie after lie. Folks, it’s time to stand up and take back our democracy. We can do this. We can be better than what we’ve been. We can be who we are at our best, the United States of America. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

How are you doing? (00:10)
How are you? The name’s Joe. (00:16)
Hi, [crosstalk 00:00:16] as a matter of fact, watch me and my daughter. The love of my life, the life of my love. She’s a fan of yours.en: (00:22)
Hi, how are you? (00:23)
This is [Ashley 00:00:24].en: (00:24)
Good. How are you doing? (00:26)
You know the nickname she gave her father when she was growing up?She’d call me Joey B. So we may be related or something [crosstalk 00:00:33].en: (00:33)
Yep. Cardi B, Joey B [crosstalk 00:00:35]. I’m a huge fan [crosstalk 00:00:37] and I just wanted to say [crosstalk 00:00:38] hi. (00:52)
You’re telling me. (00:54)
I got four kids, five grandkids. Come on. I’m an expert. I understand about kids. The most important thing in the world. They come first. (01:08)
Keep it that way. (01:13)
Oh, I do have some questions for you. First of all, I want to congratulate you, the cover of Elle. I tell you, that’s pretty good. That’s pretty big time. Number one, doesn’t surprise me you’re on the cover. But number two, thanks for your generosity, dealing with people who are suffering from COVID. There’s so many people who needlessly are in trouble, who are needlessly have died when they didn’t have to, if we had taken the precautions we needed to. And thank you, you have a generous heart. You have a generous heart. And [crosstalk 00:01:44] what I wanted to know was, tell me, what’s your main interest, in terms of this election? (04:39)
Well, it doesn’t have to happen. For example, in 2016 if 18 to 23 or four year olds have voted in the same percentage as the rest of the population, we would have had Hillary Clinton, not him. The vote matters. That’s why you keep talking to people about the need to vote. The vote matters. It matters a great deal. And so, we got to take … Look, the generation, your generation and the young millennials beyond that, they can own this. They can own this outcome, and they can own what happens in the next election. They are the ones that can change things dramatically, if they show up and vote. Tell me what your fans most say to you when they communicate with you online. What are they most concerned about? (05:53)
That’s right. Nowhere [crosstalk 00:05:55]. (05:58)
Because people don’t want to pay the taxes for it, and that’s why this whole thing about government’s bad has been such a downer for the things that really matter to you and me … I was doing very well as a single dad when my wife and daughter got killed, and I had two boys that survived that accident. I didn’t have the money to have someone to take care of my kids. Thank God I had my sister, and my brother, and my mother who helped me. My sister moved in with me, with she and her husband. But look at all the people that don’t have that kind of help. (07:14)
One of the things that I admire about you, is you keep talking about what I call equity. Just decency, fairness. Treating people with respect. John Lewis used to say, “The vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool you have. Use the power to change for the change you want by voting.” Look, I’m a lot older than you, to state the obvious. When I was in high school, what happened was we had the civil rights movement was just being started. And what happened? Along came Bull Connor and his dogs. He thought he was going to drive a wooden stake into the heart of the civil rights movement.(07:50)
But when all those folks who never realized, never saw before what was happening in the South, they lived in places where there were very few black people, didn’t know any black people. All of a sudden they saw Bull Connor with dogs ripping off the clothes of black women, elderly women going to church, and kids being knocked down with fire hoses and their skin being ripped off. All of a sudden, as Dr. King said, we had the second emancipation. We had the Voting Rights Act and we had the Civil Rights Act. It changed things, because people said, “”Oh my God, that’s happening.(08:22)
I think I heard you say somewhere along line what I’ve been saying, this cell phone has changed America. Because what happens now? We’re at a point where some brave kid, 15 years old can stand there, and for a total of eight minutes and 46 seconds take a photograph of a black man whose family I know and met with, and understand, and spent time with, and watched him brutally murdered, brutally murdered. And people around the world were saying, “My God.” … That it really happens, because I’m not in a neighborhood like that. I don’t come from a place. And now guess what? They’re demanding change. (09:08)
That’s it. (09:31)
Treat me with respect [crosstalk 00:09:31]. (09:34)
Respect. That’s where I think you’re seeing a real … Look, I have a friend who is a congressman in Mississippi, Bennie Thompson, and a very well known congressman, an African-American. He called me two weeks ago. He said, “Joe, I just came from a protest in Mississippi,” and he said, “and I looked out there, and there were … ” I forget how many people. He said, “There was many white kids marching as black kids. This is Mississippi Joe, things are changing Joe.” The reason I’m so optimistic is because of your generation. You’re the smartest, the best educated, the least prejudice and the most engaged generation in American history, and you’re going to change things. You’re going to change them. You’re the reason I have such incredible hope. I really mean it. I’m not trying to be nice. It’s a fact. That’s what’s going to change things.(10:25)
The rest of the world has always looked to us. Why have they looked to us? Not because we’re so powerful, but the power of our example. Look what they’re seeing now with this president. He’s literally promoting hatred, promoting prejudice, promoting racism, talking about protecting the Confederate flag when Mississippi takes it off their flag, and he’s defending it. He’s talking about stats. I mean, what this is all about, all about the game of making people hate each other, because that’s how he wins, by dividing us. But you’re going to change it. Your generation is changing. You already are doing it. (11:27)
And in the primaries they kept saying, “Well, there’s not that many people voting. Biden not going to excite anybody.” We had the largest turnout in the primaries, ever. People are ready. They’re ready, and they know we can change it. But look, there’s a lot, but we really rely on people like you. And let me tell you something, the American people have never, ever, ever let their country down, given half a chance. Never. And they’ve been battered by corporate America, they’ve been battered by this president, particularly, and the way in which he’s able to continue to divide it. He appeals to the outright prejudice of some of those in that community that don’t have any money, and he just appeals to their prejudice. He spews hate. We got to stop it. (12:34)
That’s exactly right [crosstalk 00:12:34]. (13:09)
We can. (13:23)
Well by the way, the country has been mourning. And what you’re finding now, is the vast majority of the American people understand what’s going on. My mom used to have an expression. Say, “Joey, the greatest virtue of all is courage, because without courage you couldn’t love with abandoned, and without courage none of the other virtues would exist.” It’s time for some courage, and you’re exercising it. You and other people of your stature, who have millions of people who look to you, you’re exercising …(13:54)
Cardi, it’s not easy for you to do this. You’re going to get a lot of flack for the kinds of things you say, but you have the courage to stand up and say, “Now’s the time.” … By the way, we’re going to have, if I get elected president, free college education for four years of college, flat out. Anybody with a family, less than 125 grand, you’re going to get a free education. Everybody gets free education for community college. Everybody wants to go on and become an apprentice, free. (14:24)
Yep. (15:43)
And the way we can pay for all of this, is doing practical things, like making sure that no corporation making a profit should pay less than 15% tax on their profit. None. Zero. Everybody has to pay their fair share. Thank you for your willingness to help. I promise … I’ll make mistakes as president, but I’ll admit to the mistakes I make, and you’re never going to have to wonder whether I’ll keep my word. (16:10)
Thank you. (16:12)
Just check me out. I’ve never broken my word, anything I’ve said I was going to do, never in my life …"

Welcome to the nation’s Constitution Center. I had the great privilege of being a guest here. It’s an appropriate place to make the speech I’m about to make. I attended a mass earlier today and prayed for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her family. The nation lost a heroine, an icon. They also lost a mother, a grandmother, and a matriarch. We know how hard that is, to watch a piece of your soul absorb the cruelty and the pain of the dreadful disease of cancer. I spoke to her daughter and her granddaughter last night, expressing my whole family, I mean, my whole family’s sorrow, particularly my grown granddaughters, one of whom was a student of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s daughter at Columbia. They made clear to me, daughter and granddaughter, that until the very end, Justice Ginsburg displayed the character and courage we’d expect of her. They said she held their hands and gave them strength and purpose to carry on.(05:13)
It’s been noted that she passed away on Rosh Hashanah. By tradition, a person who dies during the Jewish new year is considered a soul of great righteousness. That was Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a righteous soul. It was my great honor, when I was in the Senate and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to preside over her confirmation hearings and strongly support her ascension to the Supreme Court bench. Justice Ginsburg achieved a standing few justices have or ever will. She became a presence in the lives of so many Americans and a part of our culture.(06:00)
I agree with what others have said, that she did as much to advance the constitutional rights, opportunities, and justice for women as Justice Marshall did for African Americans. Yes, there was humor and mentions of the Notorious RBG and her impressive exercise routines, but there was so much more. She was, to use an overused word, a trailblazer, a role model, a source of hope and a powerful voice for justice. She was proof, proof that courage and conviction and moral clarity can change not only the law, it can change our culture. It can change the world. And I believe in the days and months and years ahead, excuse me, she will continue to inspire millions of Americans all across this country. And together we can, and we will, continue to be a voice for justice in her name.(07:05)
Her granddaughter said yesterday and said publicly that her dying words were, “My most fervent wish is that I not be replaced until a new president is installed.” As a nation, we should heed her final call to us, not as a personal service to her, but as a service to the country, our country, at a crossroads. There’s so much at stake, the right to healthcare, clean air, clean water, the environment, equal pay for equal work, the rights of voters, immigrants, women, workers. And right now our country faces a choice, a choice about whether we will come back from the brink.(08:01)
That’s what I would like to talk with you about for a few minutes today. Within an hour of news of her passing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said President Trump’s nominee to replace Justice Ginsburg will receive a vote in the Senate. Within an hour of her passing. The exact opposite of what he said when President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace Justice Scalia in 2016. At that time, Majority Leader McConnell made up a rule based on the fiction that I somehow believe there should be no nomination to the court in an election year. That’s ridiculous. The only rule I’ve ever followed relating to the Supreme Court nomination was the Constitution’s obligation for senators to provide their advice and their consent to a president’s judicial nominee.(09:02)
But he created a new rule, the McConnell rule. Absolutely no hearing, no vote for a nominee in an election year, period, no caveats, and many Republican senators agreed with him, including then Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, including the current Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who at the time said, and I quote verbatim, here’s what he said. “I want you to use my words against me if there’s a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term. You can say, Lindsey Graham said, let’s let the next president, whoever it might be, make the nomination.” Continuing to quote, “And you could use my words against me, and you’d be absolutely right.” End of quote. That’s what Republicans said when Justice Scalia passed away about nine months before election day that year.(10:18)
Now, having lost Justice Ginsburg less than seven weeks before the election this year, after Americans have already begun to cast their vote. It’s estimated that up to 40% of Americans will have voted by October 1st, but at least 30%. Tens of millions. And you can’t unring the bell. Having made this their standard when it served their interests, they cannot just four years later change course when it doesn’t serve their ends. Look, I’m not being naive. I’m not speaking to President Trump, who will do whatever he wants. I’m not speaking to Mitch McConnell, who will do what he wants, and he does. I’m speaking to those Republicans out there, Senate Republicans, who know deep down what is right for the country and consistent with the Constitution, as I stand here in the Constitution Center, not just what’s best for their party.(11:30)
I’m speaking for millions of Americans out there who already have voted and continue to vote, and we’ll have many more voted by the time this process is finished. Millions of Americans who are voting because they know their healthcare hangs in the balance. In the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory, Donald Trump is before the Supreme Court, trying to strip healthcare coverage away from tens of millions of families. This took away the peace of mind of more than 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions. If he succeeds, insurers could once again discriminate or drop coverage completely for people living with preexisting conditions, like asthma, diabetes, cancer, and so many other problems.(12:28)
And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be, it’s estimated that 200 million people have died probably by the time I finish this talk, the complications of COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, could become the next deniable preexisting condition for over six million Americans who’ve already contracted the disease.(13:09)
Millions of Americans are also voting because they don’t want nearly half a century of legal precedent to be overturned and lose the right to choose. Millions of Americans who are at risk of losing their right to vote. Millions of Dreamers who are at risk of being expelled from the only country they have ever known. Millions of workers. Union workers who are at risk of losing their right to collectively bargain. Millions of Americans who are demanding that their voices be heard, that equal justice be a guarantee for all, not just some. They know, we all know, what should happen now. The voters of this country should be heard. As I said, voting has already begun. By the time we get to the middle of October, there will be millions and millions and millions who have already voted. In just a few weeks, all votes in this nation will be heard. They’re the ones who the Constitution envisions should decide who has the power to make this appointment.(14:27)
This appointment isn’t about the past. It’s about the future, and the people of this nation, and the people of this nation are choosing their future right now, as they vote. To jam this nomination through the Senate is just an exercise in raw political power, and I don’t believe that the people of this nation will stand for it. President Trump has already made it clear, this is about power, pure and simple power. Whether the voters should make it clear on this issue and so many others, the power in this nation resides with them, the American people, the voters, and even if President Trump wants to put forward a name now, the Senate should not act until after the American people select their next president, their next Congress, their next Senate. If Donald Trump wins the election, then the Senate should move on his selection and weigh the nominee he chooses fairly.(15:39)
But if I win this election, President Trump’s nominee should be withdrawn, and as a new president I should be the one who nominates Justice Ginsburg’s successor, a nominee who should get a fair hearing in the Senate before a confirmation hearing, before a confirmation vote, I should say, after a confirmation hearing.(16:05)
We’re in the middle of a pandemic. Like I said, as I speak, we’re probably passing 200,000 deaths lost to this virus. Tens of millions of Americans are unemployed. Healthcare in this country hangs in the balance before the court. And now, in a raw political move, this president and the Republican leader have decided to jam a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court through the United States Senate. That’s the last thing we need at this moment. As I said, voters have already begun casting their votes in the millions. And in just a few weeks, we’re going to know who the voters of this nation have chosen as the next president. The United States Constitution was designed to give voters one chance, one chance to have their voice heard in who serves on the court. And by the way, there’s no court session between now and the end of this election.(17:12)
That moment is now for the voters to get a chance to be heard, and their voice should be heard. And I believe voters are going to make it clear. They’ll not stand for this abuse of power, this constitutional abuse. There’s no discussion about what happens if the Senate confirms on the eve of election or in a lame duck after Donald Trump loses. A successor to Justice Ginsburg, what happens? But that discussion assumes that we lose this effort to prevent the grave wrong that Trump and McConnell are pursuing here. I’m not going to assume failure at this point. I believe the voices of the American people should be heard and will be heard. This vote, this fight, this nomination will not be over until the Senate votes, if it does vote. Winning that vote, if it happens, is everything. Action and reaction, anger and more anger, sorrow and frustration at the way things are in this country now politically, that’s the cycle that Republican senators will continue to perpetuate if they go down this dangerous path that they put us on.(18:37)
We need to deescalate, not escalate. That’s why I appeal to those few Senate Republicans, the handful who really will decide what happens. Please, follow your conscience. Don’t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created. Don’t go there. Uphold your constitutional duty, your conscience. Let the people speak. Cool the flames that have been engulfing our country. We can’t keep rewriting history, scrambling norms, ignoring our cherished system of checks and balances. That includes this whole business of releasing a list of potential nominees that I would put forward. They’re now saying, after Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, they said, “Biden should release his list.” It’s no wonder the Trump campaign asked that I release the list only after she passed away. It’s a game for them. It’s a play to [inaudible 00:19:44] up emotions and anger.(19:46)
There’s a reason why no presidential candidate, other than Donald Trump, has ever done such a thing. First, putting a judge’s name on a list like that could influence that person’s decision making as a judge, and that would be wrong, or at least create the perception that it would have influence. Second, anyone put on a list like that under these circumstances will be subject to unrelenting political attacks. Because any nominee I would select would not get a hearing until 2021 at the earliest, she would endure those attacks for months on end, without being able to defend herself. Thirdly, and finally, perhaps most importantly, if I win, I’ll make my choice for the Supreme Court not based on a partisan election campaign, but on what prior presidents have done, Republican and Democrats, and I’ve served with many of them.(20:49)
Only after consulting Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate and seeking their advice and asking for the consent, it says, “Advice and consent of the Senate,” the president is the person who gets to name someone, propose. The Senate deposes. As everyone knows, I made it clear that my first choice for the Supreme Court will make history as the first African American woman justice. But I’ll consult with senators in both parties about that pick, as well as the legal and civil leaders in our country. In the end, the choice will be mine and mine alone, but I will consult. It will be the product of a process that restores our finest traditions, not the extension of one that’s torn this country apart the last years.(21:47)
So let me conclude with this. As I’ve said in this campaign, we’re in the battle for the soul of this country. We face historic crises, once in a generation pandemic, a devastating economic recession, the rise of white supremacy that the FBI directors warned us against, unseen since the sixties, and a reckoning on race that’s long overdue, a challenging climate, a changing climate that is ravaging our nation and the world as we speak. Supreme Court decisions will touch every part of these crises, every part of our lives and our future. The last thing we need is to add a constitutional crisis that plunges us deeper into the abyss, deeper into the darkness.(22:51)
If we go down this path, I predict it will cause irreversible damage. The infection this president has unleashed on our democracy can be fatal. Enough. Enough. Enough. We must come together as a nation. Democrats, Republicans, independents, liberals, conservatives, everybody. I’m not saying we have to agree on everything, but we have to reason our way through what ails us as citizens, voters, public service. That’s the guidebook called the Constitution. We have to act in good faith, in mutual goodwill, in the spirit of conciliation, not confrontation.(23:49)
This nation will continue to be inspired by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but we should not only be inspired by her, we should be guided by her, by her willingness to listen to those with whom she disagreed, to respect other points of view. Famously, Justice Ginsburg got along well with some of the most conservative justices on the court. And she did it without compromising her principles, clouding her moral clarity, or losing her core principles. If she can do this, so can we. How we talk to one another matters, how we treat one another matters, respecting others matters. Justice Ginsburg proved it’s important to have a spine of steel, but also important to have an open hand, not a clenched fist, to those with whom we disagree.(24:54)
This nation needs to come together. I’ve said it many times in this election. We are the United States of America. There’s nothing we cannot overcome. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. Donald Trump seems to want to divide this nation between red states and blue states, between representing those states that vote for him and ignoring those who don’t. I do not. I cannot, I will not be that president. I’ll be a president for the whole country, for those who vote for me and those who vote against me. We need to rise in this moment for the sake of the country we love so dearly, indeed for its very soul. May God bless the United States of America. May God protect our troops. And may God bless Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Thank you so much."

Good afternoon, everyone. Let me say to the press assembled, I’m going to make a short statement here, and then I’m going over to vote with my wife and then I’ll be happy to take your questions after I vote. Okay?(02:57)
I just completed in here another public health briefing with my team of public health experts. We looked at the latest reported data on how it indicates that we’re on an upward slope of a bigger wave of confirmed infections than anything we experienced to date. We talked about what actions would be needed to turn this around and how it will be made worse by this administration’s declaration of surrender to the virus. And we discussed again, the vital importance of wearing masks, of protecting yourself, protecting your neighbor, and to save around a 100,000 lives in the months ahead between now and just after the first of the year. This is not political, it’s patriotic. Wearing a mask, wear one, period.(03:49)
We focused on the way this virus is hitting communities of color much harder, particularly black, Latino and Native American communities. We’re seeing race-based disparities across the aspects of this virus, higher infection rates, but lower access to testing and harder time quarantining safely because of their financial circumstances. Lower access to quality treatment, when they are infected and tragically higher mortality rates. One in 1,000 black Americans have died from this virus. This is a staggering statistic and 57% of black adults, 46% of Latino adults know someone who has died or been hospitalized from disease.(04:35)
Folks, we’ve lost more than 220,000 lives to this virus already. But this administration has just given up. Over the weekend, the White House, chief of staff Mark Meadows, went on television and admitted that they’ve waived the white flag and declared surrender. He said quote, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” End of quote. The American people deserve so much better than this. Just look at what happened last night in Omaha, after the Trump rally ended. Hundreds of people, including older Americans and children were stranded in sub-zero freezing temperatures for hours. Several folks ended up in the hospital. It’s an image that captures President Trump’s whole approach to this crisis. He takes a lot of big pronouncements and he makes a lot of big pronouncements, but they don’t hold up.(05:25)
He gets his photo op and then he gets out. He leaves everyone else to suffer the consequences of his failure to make a responsible plan. It seems like he just doesn’t care much about it. And the longer he’s in charge, the more reckless he gets, it’s enough. It’s time to change. Meanwhile, yesterday, the White House science office and this stunned me, put out a statement listing ending the COVID-19 pandemic as a top accomplishment of President Trump’s first term. Top accomplishment of Trump’s first term. At the very moment when infection rates are going up in almost every state in our union, the refusal of the Trump administration to recognize the reality we’re living through at a time when almost a 1,000 Americans a day are dying. Every single day is an insult to every single person suffering from COVID-19 and every family who’s lost a loved one. There’s nothing more personal. There’s nothing more personal to an American family than their health care and the health care of their loved ones.(06:36)
I know all too well what it feels like to have your heart ripped out, losing a loved one too soon. To sit in the hospital bedside and feel like there’s a black hole in the middle of your chest, knowing there’s not much you can do. I and many of you know what it feels like to watch a beloved person die, why they’re dying of cancer or some other disease without having to wonder about whether you’re can pay for the medical bills or what would happen if God forbid the insurance companies were able to come in and say, ” We’re not going to cover the treatment.” And yet today, President Trump is on a single-minded crusade to strip Americans of their health care. That would only create another enormous crisis in the public health system.(07:20)
In two short weeks, exactly one week after the election, the Trump administration will make its case, asking the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act quote, “In its entirety.” In its entirety. Let me say that again. They’re arguing that the entire law must fall, which would strip 20 million Americans have their health insurance overnight, rip away protections for pre-existing conditions for more than 100 million people in the middle of an upswing of a pandemic, the upswing.(07:57)
Look, just this week on 60 Minutes, we heard what Trump told Lesley Stahl about the upcoming Supreme Court case on the Affordable Care Act. And I quote, “I hope that they end it’ll be so good if they end it.” End of quote. There is no question. There’s no question. That’s why President Trump nominated Justice Barrett to the court. And that’s why the Republicans jammed her through confirmation in the middle of the election. Republicans have tried and tried and tried since the Affordable Care Act was passed to overturn it. And every single time they failed.(08:39)
President Trump has tried everything he can on his own to sabotage the law. So now through what I’d characterize as a craving abusive of political power. They’ve added to the Court of Justice who criticized Chief Justice, Roberts’ previous decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act in hopes that they can destroy the Affordable Care Act once and for all through the courts. No matter how many Americans they hurt in the process. So let’s remember exactly what’s at stake in this election. If you have diabetes, asthma, cancer, or even complications from COVID-19, you’re going to lose the protection this law provides. Insurers will once more be able to jack-up your premiums or deny your coverage. Women could again be charged more for their health care just because they’re women and children will no longer be able to stay in their parents’ insurance policies until age 26.(09:36)
On top of all that, overturning the ACA could mean that people have to pay to get COVID-19 vaccine once it’s available. That’s right. That’s right. The law that says insurers are required to cover vaccines for free is the Affordable Care Act. And he’s striking that down, attempting to. Unlike Donald Trump, I believe health care isn’t a privilege, it’s a right that everyone have access to it? This country can’t afford four more years of a president who thinks he’s only responsible for the wellbeing of the people who voted for him. We can’t afford four more years of a president who instead of fighting the virus, attacks doctors. I can’t get over the guy. He attacked doctors claiming their over-reporting COVID cases because they want to make more money. Doctors are over-reporting cases because they want to make money.(10:38)
Our doctors and nurses and our frontline health care workers are putting themselves at enormous risk every day. More than a 1,000 of them have already died in attempt to beat back this pandemic and save lives. They deserve to be treated with respect by their president. We can’t afford four more years of a president who’d rather spend his time desperately trying to strip people of their health care, and even once bothered to put forward a health care plan on his own. We can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump. And the good news is we have a chance to turn this around by voting. We have six more days left in this election and the American people have it in their hands to put this country in a vastly different path.(11:26)
This is my commitment to you. I’ll protect and build on the Affordable Care Act, so that you can keep your private insurance or choose a Medicare like option. You can make it stronger. I’m going to make it stronger with your help to lower premiums and deductibles. And out-of-pocket expenses. We’ll bring down drug prices, but almost two thirds by taking steps such as allowing Medicare to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies who are making billions of dollars, making the price lower. When they negotiate, Medicare says, “We’re only going to pay you X amount for the following medicines.” That will lower prices drastically making it available to everyone.(12:12)
We’re going to make sure every American has access to free COVID-19 vaccine. This isn’t beyond our capacity. Now, if we come together, we can stand together. If we stand together as the United States, the United States, Democrats, Republicans and independents. We can transcend all divisions and show what’s possible. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to America’s future. And if I’m elected president, as I said yesterday in Warm Springs, Georgia. I’ll be a president who is not in it for himself, but for others. A president of doesn’t divide us, but unites us. A president who appeals not to the worst in us, but to the best in us and a president who looks not to settle scores, but to find solutions. A president guided not by wishful thinking, but by science, reason and facts.(13:13)
Even if I win, it’s going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic. I’m not running on the false promise of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switch. But what I can promise you is this, we will start on day one doing the right things. We’ll let science drive our decisions. We will deal honestly with the American people and we will never, ever, ever quit. That’s how we’ll shut down this virus. So we can get back to our lives, a lot more quickly than the pace we’re going at now. I’m going to fight to protect your health care, I promise you. Just like I fight for my own family. We can do this. I promise you, and I’m going to go do what I hope all of you do.(14:05)
I’m going to walk out of this building and I’m going to go vote. I’m going to go vote. There’s a lot of people on that ballot, not just me, but the down-ballot as well, that are going to change things for us. Make it better. So may God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you."
biden_speech_alliance.txt,"(00:00)
… I just want you to know that I appreciate the opportunity to be here and appreciate the opportunity to move on. Alliance started as a place where people came together and it’s what we so badly need to do now in this country, is begin, again, to come together. We rode today with some remarkable Ohioans and whose families are here, Tiffany Davis and her husband, Tom, and her kids and Jacqueline, [Komar 00:00:25] and her husband, William, and their daughter and grandson, and [Dave Worshack 00:00:35] and his wife, Kathy, and their children.(00:36)
It was an honor to get a chance to meet them and to spend a little time talking about their circumstances. How Tom who worked online at Lordstown is now making that eight hour drive to Kentucky so he can keep a job and make a living, and Jacqueline who taught high school math at Maple Heights for years, and now worries, what’s going to happen to William if they lose the protections that are available through Obamacare for preexisting conditions? And Dave who’s fighting like hell for his coworkers after management announced the Akron plant was going to close this year. Like millions of hardworking Americans, they’re not looking for a handout, they’re just looking for a fair shot to be seen, to be understood, to be heard.(01:28)
They remind me of my dad. I was from another Valley, a little further East, the Lackawanna Valley, Scranton, Pennsylvania. My dad had a job in Scranton and when coal died and everything started to close up, we ended up in a circumstance where my dad did what you’re doing old buddy, only he didn’t have to do it for eight hours, what made that, what I called the longest walk a parent ever has to make, up a short flight of stairs and say, “Honey, I’m not going to be home during the week. I’m going to have to move down, in this case, to Delaware.”(02:02)
That was only about a three and a half hour ride at that time, not an eight hour ride. He did that for well over a year, and finally was able to get us to … We had to move. There was no work. My dad, it just reminds me of what he used to always say, and I apologize the press hearing me say this many times, but it’s a fact and it’s relevant. My dad used to say in Wilmington, Delaware, when we finally were able to purchase a home, move on an apartment and get going again. My dad would say, “Joe remember, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to hold your head up. Be able to look at your kid and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.”” “Well, the fact is I don’t expect the government to solve my problem,” he’d say, “But I do expect them to at least understand the problem.”(03:00)
That’s what last night’s debate was about, this whole election is about, does your president have any idea and understand what you’re going through? And if he does, does he care about it? Is he able, as my mom would say, be able to walk a mile and your shoes, if you wanted to know me, they’re able to do that? Or does he just ignore you, look down on you, lie to you, like this president did when he told Ohio workers that, “Don’t sell your house, don’t sell your house because no more factories are going to close.” What I saw last night was all about him. He didn’t speak to you or your concerns or the American people even once.(03:41)
Donald Trump broke his promise. He said he was running for the forgotten American. As soon as he got elected, he forgot them. I’ll never forget. You know, I understand what you do. Wall Street did not build this country. CEOs did not build this country, hard working average American people, given half a chance, built this country. The middle-class built country and unions built the middle class. I tell you what, I never forget that where I came from. A measure our successes as a nation is not how well the stock market is doing. It’s what families are able to talk about and what they deal with at their kitchen table.(04:24)
Many of the people who will hear this today woke up this morning at a kitchen table where there was one less, was an empty chair or one less chair, because they lost someone. 205,000 dead because of COVID. Over 7 million infected. It’s just … And what happened last night? Did you hear a word from the president about any of that? Look tables like the one that we saw last night are ones that were set by Trump. For 36 years, as I said, I took a 250 mile round trip on Amtrak every day to commute from Wilmington to Washington. I got to know the engineers, the conductors, the folks in the food service card.(05:13)
At night as I’d ride home and going between Washington and Baltimore, I see those lights on and those homes along the tracks, middle-class homes, three bedroom split-level types that I grew up in, and I’d often wonder, “What are they talking about? What are they dealing with? What’s going on in their heads? What was it like what’s going on at my house? “No, honey, you got to ride on those tires for another four or five, 6,000 miles. We can’t afford new ones right now.”” Or who’s going to tell her? Who’s going to tell him they can’t go back to that school because we just don’t have the money? Or what are we going to do?(05:51)
I can remember my father, we lived in a three bedroom house with four kids and a grandpop. I can remember the walls were thin. I can remember my dad rolling around at night. I could hear him. Our room was next to him. I remember asking my mom one day, “What’s the matter with dad?” She said, “We just lost the insurance. We have no health insurance.” So look, these are the things that people are worried about. My guess is that the same thing is happening everywhere in America. The question people are asking is, is it going to be okay?(06:23)
Folks, this election, in my view, is between Scranton and Park Avenue, between Alliance and Park Avenue. It’s about whether or not the parents are going to look their kids in the eye and going to be able to say, “It’s going to be okay.” That’s what we talked about on the way down here on the train. We talked about it all along this whistle stop tour because I’m coming into places where people are hurting, where people have lost their jobs, but where there used to be real opportunity. This is all about, in my view, how we’re going to support working families to give people an equal shot, just so they can be able to have a chance to be able to just make a decent living.(07:05)
And folks to protect your pensions, your healthcare, to make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. To me, that’s what this is all about. It’s a trade-off. Do we allow corporate America to continue to pay [inaudible 00:07:21] pay no tax at all while you’re having your healthcare taken away in the name of, “We can’t afford it.” Do we allow billionaire to get another $30 billion tax break So they pay a lower rate than you pay if you have a job as a school teacher? Do we allow that? Or do we invest in our schools? What should we be doing right now? And what should we be doing for the last five months?(07:47)
The president, instead of being in the sand trap in his golf course, should be in the White House and the Oval Office, inviting Democrats and Republicans to be there with him and to settle, settle how we’re going to make sure we can bail out the small businesses that are going under. Make sure people can keep their insurance, making sure we have the ability to open our stores and our schools safely. It costs money to do that, but what’s he doing? He’s doing nothing.(08:14)
By the way, I find it fascinating. They had time at the very end of this election to hold a hearing on a Supreme Court justice, but the Senate does not have time to deal with making sure schools and businesses have the PPE they need, the protective gear, does not have the sanitary conditions available to them and the money to pay for them to open up, does not have the capacity and so on. It’s kind of amazing, isn’t it? They have time to rush through a nominee after an election has already started, but no time to deal with the everyday concerns about the American people.(08:50)
Look, let me conclude by saying, not withstanding where we are right now, I am extremely optimistic. I’m optimistic because the American people know this is not who we are. They’re ready to get up again. They’re ready to come back. We just have to give them a shot. So we’re better positioned than any nation in the world to take back this 21st century, we’re ready to do it, but we’re going to only do it if we do it together. If I get elected president, I’m not going to be the Democrat president, I’m going to be an American president. I’m going to represent you whether you vote for me or you vote against me. This is about the United States of America, our place in the world and the security and wellbeing of people just given an equal chance, an equal chance to have a shot at the American dream that’s been denied them right now.(09:42)
Thank you very much for listening. I’m happy to take questions. I don’t even know where to start. I guess I’ll start and work my way a little bit. Yes? (10:07)
It’s not an inconsequential assertion. Look, he did what I expected him to do last night. He announced what he was going to do. He announced he was going to … I think the phrase was, “Now we can become really vicious.” I think that was his phrase, at some point. Look, last night reinforced for me why I got in this race in the first place. Last night, and I said, when I got in the race, we were in the battle for the soul of this country.(10:39)
Can you all see me? Should I turn this way a little bit?(10:42)
Trump’s constant disregard and unwillingness to speak to COVID and the fact that 205 thousand people have already died, and over 7 million are infected and it’s likely to get worse. He didn’t want to talk about it at all.(11:02)
In terms of election legitimacy, he made it clear that if he lost, it wouldn’t be a legitimate election. Already began to plant seeds of doubt in the legitimacy of this election. I don’t know any president’s ever done that before. His dog whistle, the white supremacy, when asked, “Would he condemn white supremacy?” He didn’t say a word. Then when I said, “Well, how about the Proud Boys?” Which is a white supremacist group. He said, “Well, I just told them to stand down and stand ready,” stand down and stand ready based on the outcome of the election?(11:40)
Last night was, I think, a wake up call for all Americans. What I tried to do, last night, I tried to speak directly into the camera to the American people, to talk about their concerns, to talk about what’s on their mind, to talk about what I would do, were I president. Trump has no plants, no ideas, didn’t express a single plan that he had about how he’s going to move forward. It made me realize just how much is at stake. For 90 minutes, he tried everything to distract, everything possible and it just didn’t work. But I hope that this next debate is going to be in front of real live people, it’s going to be a town hall. I just hope we’re able to … I’m looking forward to it. I hope we’re able to get a chance to actually answer the questions that are asked by the persons in the room, but God only knows what he’ll do. Yes. (12:57)
Well he not only attacked me constantly, and my family, but he attacked the moderator. Again, on his tweets this morning or last night. I just hope there’s a way of which the debate commission can control the ability of us to answer the question without interruptions. I’m not going to speculate on what happens in the second or third debate. My hope is that they’re able to literally say, “The question gets asked of Trump. He has the microphone, he has two minutes to answer the question. No one else has a microphone.” Then I don’t know what the actual rules are going to be, literally, but that would seem to me to make some sense, but I’m looking forward to it. (13:55)
I can understand it. It was … I kind of thought, at one point, maybe I shouldn’t say this, but the president of the United States conducted himself the way he did. I think it was just a national embarrassment. But look, I just hope that the American people and those undecided voters try to determine what each of us has an answer for their concerns and allows us to actually speak. Yes. (15:00)
Cease and desist. Cease and desist. The American people will decide who the next president of United States will be period. So I’m urging the American people go out and vote, show up. If you can vote early, vote early, vote whatever way is most convenient for you, but vote. If you show up in large enough numbers, nothing is going to change.(15:25)
I promise you if in fact we win this election, this president will step down. It’s a lot of bravado. He has no alternative. The American people will not stand for it, no agency would stand for that happening. My message to the Proud Boys and every other white supremacist group is cease and desist. That’s not who we are. This is not who we are as Americans. (15:50)
All right, I’m going to let you pick somebody because you got everybody out here. (16:04)
I think this works, yes. (16:35)
No, I haven’t. I appreciated her endorsement. Look, we had a debate with, I don’t know, 20 to 25 people in the Democratic Party. I said at the time that I would tell you exactly what I believed and I would say why I believed it and why I was running. That’s exactly what I did. I did not support Medicare for all. I do not support it now. I support the Biden plan that I’ve laid out. I’ve laid out the most extensive plan with the detail on how I will get us to net zero emissions in the energy sector by 2035, putting thousands of people to work. I’ve laid out how, in fact, I’m going to get us to net zero emissions in the United States of America by 2050 across the board, how I’d rejoin the Paris Accord, which I helped put together, et cetera.(17:34)
So the Green New Deal that the president keeps trying to talk about, it’s not a bad deal, but it’s not the plan I have, that’s the Biden green deal. That’s what this is about. What the president keeps trying to do is he’s trying to run somebody other than me. I’ve said to the left, to the right, and the center, exactly where I am on each of these issues. I did have time and I’ve worked very hard with all segments of the party. We put together a platform that is a platform that I fully support.(18:07)
The President keeps talking about … What’s he call it? He has some name for our platform, I can’t remember what it is. Is the- (18:18)
The manifesto. Thank you. The manifesto. Well, the Democratic platform is the one that I’ve signed on to. The one that the vast majority, overwhelming majority, of Democrats signed on to. But the democratic party is a big tent and we have all kinds of folks in it that have different views and they’re all welcome. We negotiated, we debated and we had a primary election and I won and I’ve laid out what we’re going to do. So I’m not worried about losing the left, right, or the center of the party, this is a big party, but I have one of the most progressive records any Democrats run on. I’m proud of it, but it’s my record, and it’s what I want to do. So thank you. Thank you very much. (19:08)
You don’t mind, I’m going to get in trouble with the conductor because I’d like to stay and answer a lot of your questions. Do I think he’s created a crisis in confidence? Look, all you have to do is look at the polls all your networks run, and a significant member of the American people are worried about what he recommends having anything to do with … Look there, right? Is that what you’re trying to tell me? To deal with the COVID crisis. They’ve lost confidence in him.(19:38)
So that’s why I think it’s really important that the scientists continue to speak out, say exactly what constitutes an appropriate approach to dealing with COVID, whether it is a vaccine or any other proposal, and God willing, we’re going to have a vaccine sooner than later, God willing, we’ll be able to distribute it as rapidly as possible.(20:00)
But it gets down to, ultimately, the American people have to have trust in the what the president says, and it’s quite clear, many, many, many people don’t trust him. As it relates as well to businesses. They say, “Open up.” Even businesses opened up are having trouble getting people to come in because, in fact, the president says things that are just not accurate.(20:24)
But I’m confident that we’re going to get in this train or y’all are going to have to run behind it and we got to get going. But thank you all very much. I’ll talk to you the next stop, wherever I’m doing. Thank you."

Hello, Arizona. It’s great to be back. It really is. It’s great to be back. Thank you, Kamala. Thank you, [Vanessa 00:03:08]. Appreciate it very, very much. And we met backstage, and the first instinct we all had was to hug each other. And we went, “No, no. We got to stay 12 feet apart.” But folks, I want to give a special thanks to Ruben Gallego for being here. And you’re a big deal, man. I’m serious. And I notice he did something that… This is what we call, in our business, a busman’s holiday, coming to hear another politician speak, and having to put a tie on when he shows up without a tie. But thank you very much. I appreciate it, pal. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And the president and COO of the Southwest Regional Council, Pete Rodriguez. Where are you, Pete? Is he in here, or is he back in his office? Wherever he is, I want to thank him- (14:58)
Not here now? Well, also so Fabian Sandez, president of the local 1912. And you’ve all been with me. We were talking, Kamala and I, coming down the hall, and we said… Not a joke. It was just purely coincidental. She said, “I love the carpenters.” She said, “The first outfit that endorsed me when I ran for attorney general for-” (15:21)
“… the DA in San Francisco, were the carpenters.” And I said, “I remember mine well, a guy named Cal [McCullough 00:00:15:29], president of the Carpenter’s Union from New Castle, Delaware, one of the 350 year old city on the Delaware River was the first one to endorse me as well.” And so, you’ve been with me my whole career, and president Doug McCarron has been a long time friend. We’ve worked together a long time. 520,000 carpenters. That’s an incredible army to have behind you. And you are, I’m telling you. You have, my whole career, and I hope you know I’ve had years as well. There’s an old expression when I was growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It said, “You go home with them that brung you to the dance.” Well, the carpenters brought me to the dance, and you’re going home together. You’re going to have a seat at the table.(16:13)
Folks, people who shaped the skyline, who build the foundations, everything rely on, the carpenters. Labor brought me to the dance. And the only reason I’m able to run for president is because, standing here today, because of labor. I’ve never forgotten everything you’ve done for me and you’ve done for the country. I really mean it. I get in trouble for saying this, but it’s true. You’re the backbone of America. You’re the spine of America. You’re the ones who actually built the country, not Wall Street, bankers, and CEOs. You’re the ones who are going to rebuild it again. You’re going to build it back better, for real. Kamala and can’t thank you enough. And folks, I don’t know if you caught it, but the senator had a heck of a night last night. I tell you what, you got to give me a great credit for knowing how to pick them. Right? I couldn’t be prouder. She’s like a younger sister.(17:21)
I couldn’t be prouder to be running alongside such a leader with remarkable character and vision. And who always, always, always is looking out for the people, always somebody else, not her. Always. And I want to tell you something, Kamala and I are about to kick off a tour, visiting businesses in this community. Small businesses in this community and all communities are more responsible for more jobs than… In the community, local small business owners… They’re busting their necks, than the major corporations. You add it all up, for real. Small businesses create more jobs in America than the major corporate entities. And this community has found itself having to go through some really challenging times, and I need not tell the congressman that. He’s forgotten more about it than most people know.(18:16)
And like Chef Silvana. Chef Silvana owns two restaurants here in Phoenix. She had both. When they were struck by COVID, she had to close one of them down. And she’s working hard to keep the other one afloat, Barrio cafe, which we’re going to be visiting later this afternoon. But it isn’t easy. The loan Silvana was able to secure back in the spring because of the legislation passed by the Democrats in the House, helped her for a little while, but it wasn’t nearly enough. She’s scraping by week to week, trying to look out for her 10 employees, some of whom have been with her for decades. And on top of that, she’s facing, and I have permission to say this, she’s facing a terminal disease. Silvana had to cancel her own health insurance after finishing a round of treatment recently just to make ends meet. It’s devastating, and it’s heartbreaking, and it’s wrong.(19:16)
Every American should be upset about what Savannah is going through. I think you all are. I know I am. Because I know, we know, it didn’t have to happen. If they had just done what you passed, just move forward. And then, I’ll talk about it in a minute. But Silvana’s story is increasingly common story for Arizona workers and small business owners. Too many Arizonans are facing hard times right now. They’re trying their best, but it never feels like it’s enough. You’re not looking out for a handout. They’re just looking for a fair shot. Just want an even shot. That’s all they’re looking for. And that’s how my dad felt when he couldn’t find work in Scranton when coal died, he had to move on. I remember him taking us, what I call the longest walk any parent has to make up a short flight of stairs to tell their kid, “Honey, I’m sorry, but you can’t go back to St. Paul’s. You can’t go play in that little league anymore. Dad’s lost his job. There’s no job here. I’m going to have to move.”(20:17)
I remember him taking us to our grandpop’s house. Me, and my brother, and my sister, and my mom was certainly going to have another child. And we all went home. I thought about how hard it must’ve been for my dad. So many people in this town have done the same thing. Have to go to his father-in-law, the father of four boys and a girl, and say, “I have to ask you a favor.” I know how much pride it cost him. “Can you take care of them for a year? I’ll be back. I promise. I’ll come home every weekend.” It was only 159 miles, but it seemed like the end of the world. But he went down, and by the time he was able to get a good job, a job enough to get us an apartment in a place called Claymont, Delaware. Because he had been raised in Wilmington, Delaware. He ended up, then, getting a good job, a decent job, managing a car dealership. He worked hard to build a decent middle-class life. And it wasn’t easy for him. He had an expression. He’d always say, and really, I mean this sincerely… He said, “I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure in hell expect them to at least understand my problems. Just to understand them.” And America, I think, deserves a president who understands what the American people are going through, who sees who you are, what you want to be, who cares about your health, your prosperity, your dream, your American dream. You’re facing real challenges right now. And the last thing you need is a president who exacerbates them, who ignores you. And I’m going to say it. I’ve been saying for a while. It’s my perspective from Scranton. A president who looks down at us, who thinks that if you put your life on the line for the nation, you’re a loser, a sucker.(22:03)
… line for the nation, you’re a loser, a sucker. As we were talking about with Cindy, my Beau, my son Beau who just passed, not just, passed away, now it’s going on five years, it seems like yesterday, won the Bronze Star and [inaudible 00:22:16] Service Medal. He was a volunteer. [inaudible 00:22:20] but he volunteered. He had to get an exception to be able to go to Iraq for a year. And I promise you, he wasn’t a loser. He wasn’t a sucker. He, like all the veterans we met with this afternoon alongside Cindy McCain, they’re Patriots. They’re people understand that being an American is about recognizing there’s some things bigger than yourself.(22:45)
Cindy’s husband, John McCain, who I had the great privilege of him asking me to do his eulogy, we used to argue like hell. We were like two brothers. We’d fight like hell, but we always, always, always ended up together. And that’s how it used to be. It used to be that way across the board. He wasn’t a loser. They’re all heroes. And you know what? They deserve better than a president who will say anything to deflect responsibility for any mistake he makes. I don’t know whether you noticed, he recently said that, they asked him where he got the COVID, he said, “I probably got it from Blue Star parents.” They’re people who lost a child in battle. He said, “Because they like to get close to me and hug me. I don’t know how to say no.”(23:36)
Look, we’ve paid too high a price already for Donald Trump’s chaotic, divisive leadership. More than 210,000 Americans have lost their lives to this virus. We lose more every single day. Now, these 6,000 Arizonans have been lost. I mean, 6,000 gone, gone. More than 220, 000 Arizonans have been infected with COVID. 122,000 jobs in Arizona still haven’t come back. Nine times more Arizonans are on unemployment each week than before this crisis hit. But businesses like Silvanna’s restaurant are closing, schools aren’t back to normal, because Donald Trump can’t focus on what matters. When the House passed the so-called Heroes Act, that’s that second big package they passed to get people on their feet again some time ago, but the President and Mitch McConnell did nothing to move the legislation.(24:42)
A lot of cities and states are going bankrupt because they have to balance their budgets. Our founders are pretty smart. The reason they wrote the Constitution the way they did is the Congress, the Senate, the House, the government could deficit spend in order to compensate for being able to make sure we got out of the hole. Trump is spending more time, I’ve been calling on this, as you probably know for the last four months, he should get out of his bunker and out of the sand trap from his golf courses. Not a joke. I mean, think about it. He never once, I’ve been around a while, he never one single time tried to bring Democrats and Republicans together in the White House to try to get a settlement. Not once. You can’t name me a President in the lifetime of any of you that refused to deal that way in the middle of a crisis. But the leadership of Congress together to resolve the issue is something that wasn’t on his watch.(25:45)
And on Tuesday, Congressman, I’m sure you were probably not surprised by it, but on Tuesday he announced he’s walking away from negotiations to provide additional relief for working people, mom and pop businesses, schools. Just go down the line. On October 8th, exactly two months since the Emergency Small Business Program was closed, two months of small business owners in Arizona and across the country waiting and hoping for just a little bit of help to be able to stay open, more than 400,000 small businesses are permanently closed nationwide, 400,000, millions are struggling to hang on. The legislation has already been passed. It’s there. I handled what they called the Recovery Act when we inherited a great recession. I had the ability to deal with $800 billion spent in 18 months. All the outside groups pointed out less than two-tenths of 1% waste or fraud. But do you know what we did? We provided $ 148 billion to the cities and states so you didn’t have to lay off cops, firefighters, sanitation workers.(27:10)
You didn’t have to lay off nurses, close down county hospitals. You kept it open. And America got through it and began to generate the longest period of recovery in modern history. How many more have to go under? How many more dreams have to be extinguished because this President threw in the towel? Instead of focusing on your needs, he’s still trying to take away your health care. I mean, think about that. Just think about it. I’m not, but if I were a playwright, I’m writing a play, you’re in the single solitary outfit on Broadway that would take it, because it sounds like ridiculous fiction, in the middle of a pandemic, when already 10 million Americans have lost her employer based insurance because the employer went under, he’s trying to take away insurance from another 22 million people who got it for the first time in the pre-existing conditions that the Senator talked about.(28:19)
He’s in the Supreme Court right now asking you to strike down the Affordable Care Act, the entirety of it, take away Medicare benefits for seniors. People don’t realize how deep this goes, and taking us back to a time when insurers could deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition. I want you to understand this. Women’s rights, I’m not talking about the right to choose now. Women’s rights, do you realize, before we passed, Barack and I passed the law, pregnancy was considered a pre-existing condition. Not a joke. Insurance companies were allowed to charge more for a woman for the same exact medical procedure than a man would have. Same one. And look what’s happened. Minority communities were devastated. But he’s done beyond that. He’s vowed, and this isn’t even get much attention because so much chaos is going on, he vowed to “terminate the funding source for social security.” That’s the holding tax you pay for social security, six and a half percent. He wants to terminate it so it makes it look like you got more in your paycheck.(29:39)
But the actuary at the Social Security Department said, “If he does that, social security will be bankrupt by the middle of 2023. Benefits for more than a million Arizonans rely on the whole idea of a dignified retirement.” The fact is President Trump can only see the world from Park Avenue. He thinks that Wall Street built America. That’s why he let big corporations jump in on the front lines and get the recovery money that the Congress helped pass while small businesses struggled to stay open. But people don’t know because it’s so complicated, so much is happening. The Congressman can tell you. There was an Inspector General that they appointed, meaning somebody who had independent capacity to look into anything that was being done on the money being spent. I had an Inspector General overlooking the $800 billion I was responsible for. Twice every two weeks, I met with him in detail so we knew exactly where the money was going.(30:52)
What’s the first thing the President did? He fired the Inspector General. Think about that. 40% of all the money that was supposed to go to small businesses in the first time around went to the Mar-a-Lago crowd. The wealthy. I mean, if this wasn’t so true, I’d be reluctant to say it because it sounds so bizarre. This President has forgotten the people he said he’d fight for it. I’ll never forget because I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, a little steel town. I know that the middle class, working class built this country, and unions built the middle class. And I measure economic success on what families are talking about sitting around their kitchen tables, about having a decent job and benefits, about keeping their small business dream alive, about the conversations that took place this morning. But we need four new tires. The tires are bald on the car. We’ve got to wait. We can’t afford to get them. Can’t do it. Who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to the community college because we just can’t borrow any money anymore?(32:17)
Or you have 20 million people today, 20 million people including here in Arizona, who are worried about whether they can pay this month’s mortgage payment. 20 million. And look at all the people who are worried they’re going to be thrown out in the street because they can’t pay their rent. These guys provided for all that. But nothing. Being able to look your kids in the eye. My dad would just said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it. And mean it.”(33:03)
It would be okay. And mean it, and mean it. Well, that’s what Kamala and I are focused on, to say to our kids, “Honey is going to be okay.” That’s what we’re talking about. We’re going to get this virus under control. We’re going to reopen safely and strongly creating good paying jobs and working to end this era of rancor and division. Because if we’re going to get anything done, we have to do it together. I’ve been saying this since I announced and people thought I was being naive. They said, “Oh, you got a lot of things done, Joe, before, but that was the past.” Well, guess what? If we can’t bring the country together, we’re dead. This is a democracy. It depends on a consensus. You’ve got to bring people together.(33:51)
It’s somewhat maybe presumptuous of me, but I made a major speech. I worked really, really hard on for a long time in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. And I did it two days ago. And I talked about, in Lincoln terms, that we have to bring America together. We can’t hold grudges. I’m running as a proud Democrat with a capital D, but I will be an American President, not a Democratic president. I’ll work as hard for those who didn’t support me… I promise you and look at my record… As those who did support me. Because the fact is that’s the job of a President. It’s a duty to care for everybody, not just who voted for you. After all we’ve been through, all America’s accomplished, all the years we’ve stood as a beacon to the world, we cannot allow ourselves to remain divided.(34:55)
We have the ultimate power in our hands. You know what that power is? That little sticker you have on, the power to vote. Really, you can still register here in Arizona to vote. Early voting has already begun. And the vast majority of Arizonan’s vote by mail. And those mail-in ballots will start arriving in the next couple of days. So Kamala and I are saying to you, the best thing you can do is return your ballot quickly. Don’t risk delays. Return that mail in ballot as soon as you can and make sure your voice is heard, because if your voice can overcome and go out and vote, your voice through your vote can overcome every one of the challenges we face.(35:46)
And by the way, you know what they’re setting up. They’re setting up the argument that these votes aren’t going to matter. You saw what happened today. The FBI arrested a group of militiamen who had a plan to go in and to kidnap the governor of Michigan. You’ll see it in the news tonight, the governor of Michigan. Remember those guys with the assault rifles standing in her driveway? And the President is saying things in my debate with him, like “To the proud boys and all white supremacists group, stand down, but stand ready.” This is serious stuff. We can’t just win by a vote.(36:38)
We’ve got to all turn out. We can be better than we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best. If we all get out and vote. And on our best we’re the United States of America and all can decide. It’s not some prosaic thing. The fact is America’s never, never, never, never, ever failed. We’ve stood up together. We’re the only nation in the world that’s come out of every single crisis… war or economic crisis… stronger than when we went into the crisis. So folks, I’m more optimistic today about America’s chances at home and in the world than I’ve ever been.(37:27)
I’ve been around a long time. I’ve worked with a lot of Presidents. I really mean it. We have a chance. A chance not only to improve our country, but to change the world. We have the most powerful military in the history of the world, but that’s not why the rest of the world repairs to us. It’s not the example of our power. It’s been the power of our example that has the rest of the world follow us. And that example is being trashed around the world. As the Senator said last night in the debate, it’s true. 17 major countries of the world are asked what leaders did they admire the most and trust the most? The Pugh Foundation, I think. You know what they said? More people trusted Xi Jinping of China and Putin of Russia than the President of the United States. That was profound security as well as economic impact.(38:41)
So folks let’s not quit. There’s no quit in America. We have never, ever, ever, ever, ever quit. And if we need you to stand up at any time in our history, we need you now. Thank you for being here. God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you."
biden_speech_care.txt,"(00:08)
Today, we’re in the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory and Donald Trump will file in the Supreme Court today an attempt to strip away healthcare coverage from tens of millions of families in the United States. Strip away their peace of mind, away from more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. If he succeeds, more than 23 million Americans will lose their coverage overnight, including nearly a million Pennsylvanians. Insurers could once again discriminate or deny services or drop coverage for people living with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes, cancer, and so much more. Perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, those who have complications from COVID-19 could become the new pre-existing conditions. Some survivors will experience lasting health impacts like lung scarring and heart damage and if Donald Trump prevails in court, insurers would be allowed once again to strip away coverage, jack up premiums, simply because of the battle they survived in fighting coronavirus.(01:24)
Those survivors, having struggled and won their fight of their lives, would have their peace of mind stolen at that moment they needed it most. They would live their lives caught in a vice between Donald Trump’s twin legacies, his failure to protect the American people from the coronavirus, and his heartless crusade to take healthcare protections away from American families. I’ve called on Donald Trump many times to withdraw his lawsuit. Today I’m renewing that call. Mr. President, drop the lawsuit. Stop trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Stop taking away people’s healthcare and their peace of mind. Now more than ever, stop trying to steal their peace of mind. I cannot comprehend the cruelty that’s driving him to inflict this pain on the very people he’s supposed to serve.(02:34)
You know, one of the families the Affordable Care Act has delivered peace of mind to have been the [Ritters 00:02:40] who live not far from here in Manheim, Pennsylvania. [Jan 00:02:47] and [Madeline 00:02:47] Ritter were just four years old when their mom [Stacy 00:02:51] heard some of the most devastating words that a parent can ever hear, both of her twins had been diagnosed with leukemia. I promise you, that news is news that literally stops your heart. It wrenches your entire world off its axis and the very last thing on your mind, the very last thing that should be on your mind, is whether you can afford the treatment for your children. When Stacy’s twins got sick, there was no Affordable Care Act so after draining days and endless nights, harrowing stem cell transplants and the fickle waves of hope and fear as they undulate, after enduring more than any parent should have to endure, the Ritters still faced a future where their twins could be denied coverage for the rest of their lives because they had a pre-existing condition.(04:02)
The Affordable Care Act was created to put a stop to that inhumanity, to ensure that people like Stacy, thrust into the worst nightmare of their lives, could focus on the fight that matters, save their children. Stacy’s twins won their fight. They beat cancer, and now they’re 22 years of age. Jan is studying early education in Elizabethtown College. Madeline just graduated from Arcadia University with a degree in international studies. Because of the law, the ACA, the insurance companies could no longer deny them coverage because they’re survivors of cancer, a pre-existing condition.(04:48)
I’m proud. I’m proud of the Affordable Care Act. In addition to helping people with pre-existing conditions, this is the law that delivered vital coverage for 20 million Americans who did not have health insurance. A law that bars insurance companies from capping American benefits and from charging women more for insurance simply because they are a woman. It’s a law that reduced prescription drug costs for nearly 12 million seniors [inaudible 00:05:26] see their costs spike because the Medicare donut hole would have suddenly reopened and their costs would have gone up precipitously. It’s a law that saves lives, but now, but now, in the middle of the worst public health crisis in modern history, at least since the pandemic of 1918, Donald Trump is suing to take the Ritters and millions more Americans back to the way things were. I think it’s cruel, it’s heartless, it’s callous, it’s all because in my view he can’t abide the thought of letting stand one of President Obama’s greatest achievements, the Affordable Care Act.(06:16)
You know, we’ve seen that same callousness in his handling of the coronavirus. Just over three months ago, as most Americans were first coming to grips with this unprecedented scale of danger, this pandemic, President Trump publicly claimed that and I quote, “Anybody, anybody that wants a test, anybody can get it.” It simply was not true and he knew it. Then five days ago, in his campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he admitted telling people and I quote, “We have to slow the testing down. Slow it down please.” He actually said it. In his hour and 50 minute speech, “Slow the testing down please.” At first his spokespeople tried to say he was joking, but then Trump himself said he wasn’t joking. He called testing “a double-edged sword”. Testing is a double-edged sword, that’s the quote.(07:37)
Let’s be crystal clear about what he means by that. Testing unequivocally saves lives and widespread testing is the key to opening our economy again. That’s one edge of the sword. The other edge is that he thinks that finding out that more Americans are sick will make him look bad. That’s what he’s worried about. He’s worried about looking bad. Well Donald Trump needs to stop caring about how he looks and start caring about what America, what is happening to the rest of America. The number of cases is increasing in 29 states. We’re going to be dealing with this for a long time. Trump can’t wish it away. He can’t bend it to meet his political wishes. There are no miracles coming. We’re not going to have to wait for this miracle because none is coming. We’re going to have to step up as Americans, all of us, and do both the simple things and the hard things to keep our families and our neighbors safe to reopen our economy, to eventually put this pandemic behind us, and sadly, we’re going to have to do it without responsible leadership coming out of the White House.(09:08)
So it’s up to us, all of us. We’re going to have to wear masks. I have mine off because we’re socially distanced and I’m standing in front of a microphone. I wear it everywhere I go, when I step outside of my house and I know as Americans it’s not something we’re used to, but it matters. All the evidence from all over the world tells us it just might be the single most effective thing we can do. We’re going to have to socially distance like we are here today. It’s not easy, and it seems so strange to us. Not as Americans but as human beings. We’re built to talk, to laugh, to hug, to gather with other people. I know I am and I know you are, but for now we have to socially distance. It matters. We’re going to have to find a way to keep our economy running as we bring the number of cases down. The president wants us to believe there is a choice between the economy and public health.(10:15)
Amazingly he still hasn’t grasped the most basic fact of this crisis. To fix the economy, we have to get control over the virus. Say it again, to fix the economy, we have to get control over the virus. He’s like a child who can’t believe this has happened to him. All his whining and self pity. Well this pandemic didn’t happen to him. It happened to all of us, and his job isn’t to whine about it, his job is to do something about it, to lead.(10:56)
If I have the honor of being president, I promise you I will lead. I will do everything I can to take responsibility and ease this burden on you and your families. I’ll put your family first. That will begin the dramatic expansion of health coverage and bold steps to lower healthcare costs. We need a public option, now more than ever, especially when more than 20 million people are unemployed. That public option will allow every American, regardless of their employment status, the choice to get a Medicare like plan. It will force private insurers to keep premiums low, offer better coverage because for the first time, will have to compete for your business against the public insurer that doesn’t have to make a profit. We’re going to lower premiums for people buying coverage on their own, by guaranteeing that no American ever has to spend more than 8.5% of their income on health insurance, and that number would be lower for lower income people. All of the details of this plan will be laid out in the next few weeks.(12:11)
We’re also going to further reduce costs by making it less expensive for Americans to choose plans with lower deductibles and out of pocket expenses, by lowering prescription drug prices, by ending the practice of so-called surprise billings which can leave you with unexpectedly high bills after you leave the hospital. So here’s the bottom line. My plan lowers healthcare costs, gets us universal coverage quickly, when Americans desperately need it now. Families are reeling right now, enduring illness, forced into risky choices, losing their employer’s plans in droves as their employers go out of business or have to suspend business. They need lifelines now, now. That’s what the families here today deserve. That’s what the families all across this nation deserve. They don’t need a president to go into court to deny them the healthcare they now have. They need a president who would go into the White House and will fight like hell to make sure they get the healthcare they need.(13:34)
If Donald Trump refuses to end his senseless crusade against health coverage, I look forward to ending it for him and working quickly with Congress to dramatically ramp up protections to get America universal coverage and lower healthcare costs as soon as humanly possible. This is my promise to you. When I’m president, I will take care of your healthcare coverage and your family the same way I would my own. This is personal to me and to my wife Jill. When I was sworn into the United States Senate next to a hospital bed, my wife and daughter had just been killed in a car crash and lying in that bed were my two young boys, surviving boys and I couldn’t have imagine what it would have been like if we hadn’t had healthcare, healthcare we needed and needed immediately.(14:35)
40 years later, one of those little boys, my grown son Beau Biden, after having been the attorney general and coming back from Iraq for a year, had contracted a fatal cancer. The question wasn’t whether or not he could survive it, the question was how long he would have to live, how many months. I remember sitting in that hospital, Walter Reed, with my two other children Hunter and Ashley, and Jill, and his wife and his two children, holding his hands and I remember thinking, and I give you my word to this, “What in the hell would I do if the insurance company was allowed to do what they could have done before the Affordable Healthcare Act? Come in and say you’ve run out of time. You’ve run out of your coverage. Suffer the last two, three, four, five painful months dying on your own. Suffer in peace.” I can’t fathom, I cannot fathom a parent having to go through that which is exactly what happened to many families before the Affordable Care Act.(16:13)
So Amy, I understand. When I say I’ll take care of your healthcare coverage the same way I take care of my family, there is nothing I take more seriously. That’s my promise to Stacy and Victoria and Amy and to every American. That’s what the presidency is. The presidency is a duty to care. A duty to care for everyone, not just who voted for you but to care for everyone, for all of us. No trust is more sacred, no responsibility more solemn, no purpose more fundamental than for a president to do absolutely everything that he or she can do to protect American lives.(17:05)
So we want every single American to know, if you’re sick, if you’re struggling, if you’re worried about how you’re going to get through the day, I will not abandon you, I will not leave you to face these challenges alone and we’re going to get through this together. We’re going to build a healthcare system. We’re going to build on it. We’re going to build our economy, our country, back to better than it was before this godawful crisis. That I promise you. Let me end by thanking the families for being so public and willing to come here because there’s so many families like yours all across America. When they heard you today, they said, “That’s me. I get it.” There’s real solidarity. We’re going to get this done. I promise you. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you."
biden_speech_cincinnati.txt,"(00:00)
It’s good to be back. Thank you. Thank you. It’s good to be back, Mr. Mayor, in this former terminal museum. I tell you what, this is a magnificent facade, isn’t it? I understand that a few marriage proposals were made by standing in that corner and whispering to someone in the other corner.(00:26)
Mr. Mayor, thank you for the passport into the city. Thank you for your friendship. I was looking around for it. I couldn’t see you in the light. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you for… The Mayor is very good friends with a fellow who, one of the brightest, most decent men I know, who occupies my seat in the United States Senate, Senator Chris Coons. They were Truman scholars together. And you guys seem like you’re cut from the same cloth. Thank you very, very much for your support. I appreciate it, Mr. Mayor(00:59)
And Kate, you’re something else. Now, Kate, you know, there’s an old joke. A long time ago, particular senator said to me, this is back when I was much younger, I was in my second term, running for my second term. He said, “Joe, I’ll come to Delaware for you and campaign for you or against you, whichever will help the most.” My offer still holds. I hope my endorsement didn’t hurt you. But all kidding aside, Kate, we need you in the US Congress. And I really mean it. And the reason I say that is you’re a healthcare advocate, a cancer survivor, a mom, and we need leaders like you representing the people in the First District. People who understand what’s going on every day, the discussions that take place around the kitchen table in the morning. Our families are still struggling trying to figure out what to do. And Joyce, thank you for that introduction. Before I begin, let me say that I’m saddened to hear that one of my baseball heroes, Joe Morgan, second baseman, Red’s legend, Hall of Famer and a good man passed away. And my condolences to the Morgan family and his teammates and to his fans here in Cincinnati and all across the country. He played one year on the Philadelphia Phillies.(02:29)
Now, I’m going to get myself in real trouble, but I have a bad habit of telling you the truth. I happened to grow up in a household in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where, if you wanted to have dinner, you had to be Yankees fan because that was the farm called, the Triple A ball club was a Yankee ball club. And my grandpop was an All-American football player, but he was a great Yankees fan. But it wasn’t hard back in those days. There was Whitey Ford and a few others, but in Delaware, if you are not a Phillies fan, and let me put this way, if I were not a Phillies fan, I’d be sleeping alone. My wife’s a Philly girl. You think I’m kidding. I’m not.(03:14)
But Joe actually played for a year in the Phillies if my memory serves me correctly, but he had fans all over the country. It’s amazing to be both the heart when he was a second baseman, and the voice as one of the great baseball announcers in history, of the same club. I mean, that’s a pretty incredible accomplishment. And so, my best to his family and to his fans, and he has fans all across the country.(03:45)
Folks, as my football coach says, “Go time, Joe.” It’s go time. This is the most important election of our lifetimes, not because I’m running, because what’s at stake. The next president is going to determine not just the next four years, but what the next decade or more is going to look like because there’s such a stark fundamental difference. And you here in Cincinnati can make all the difference and all the difference in Ohio.(04:23)
I learned a long time ago coming out to Ohio that you win Ohio from Cincinnati north. Head north. Well, you are the starting gate, and I love being back here. And again, what a beautiful museum and terminal this is. I spent a lot of time, as I was telling the Mayor, in train stations.(04:46)
When I first got elected to the United States Senate, I was 29. I was in Washington and interviewing my first staff using Senator Kennedy’s whip office. And I got a phone call from a first responder saying my wife and daughter had just been killed, and my two boys were really badly injured, and not sure they were going to make it. My fire department, and God, I love my fire service, took about three hours and the jaws of life to get my kids out of the car because they were broadsided by a tractor trailer. And I didn’t want any part of going to the United States Senate. My sister managed my campaign, and my younger sister and my much younger brother raised all the money we raised, $187,000. We went to our governor to determine who would they pick in my spot because I didn’t plan on going. A lot of really fine men who were in the Senate at the time, and Republicans and Democrats came to me and said, “Just come and stay for six months and help us organize.”(06:05)
And so I started commuting every day back and forth, and that’s how I got involved as sort of Mr. Amtrak. Because when they publish that, they keep fastidious records on how many miles you travel on government aircraft when your vice president. And I had traveled a little over, I think it was a 1,400,000 miles. It was on the front page of the paper, but I used to like to take the train home on Fridays still as Vice President because it costs a lot of money to take that small plane back. But in addition to that, the Secret Service felt much more secure if I wasn’t on a train, but they humored me and let me go home on Fridays sometimes. My mom was living at my home as she was passing.(06:58)
And I remember getting on the train and a guy named Angelo Negrea, I got to know their families, all the conductors and all the people all those years. And he came up to me and he grabbed me and he said, “Joey.” He grabbed my cheek. I was thought the Secret Service was going to shoot him. I said, “No.” I said, “He’s okay.” It’s a true story. And he said, “I just read, Joey, 1,400,000 miles on Air Force Two, big deal. The boys, we were checking. We had our retirement dinner. Went up to New Jersey for the dinner. You know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?” I said, “No, Ang, I don’t.” He said, “Joey,” he said, “we figure 117 days a year, 36 years, and then X number of days as Vice President, you’ve traveled 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak.” I think I hold the record, other than a conductor.(07:53)
And so they gave me a key to the engine because I can… I’m the only one I know of. I’m not supposed to say that, but I got it hidden. My point is that, as a sidelight, one of the ways we’re going to revive this economy is we’re going to end up moving high speed rail and commuter rail across this country in a way that we haven’t done before.(08:14)
But the reason I went home was the same reason why all you do, or try to, and that is to be there in the evening when my kids went to bed. In the morning, my son, Beau, my son, Hunter, and my daughter, Ashley, get them back to school in the morning on the way to the station, and then when they got older, it wasn’t the case, but gets to kiss them goodnight. And as they kid, “I know, Dad, we got to say three Hail Marys and God bless our troops.” So for 36 years we did this, 250 miles roundtrip.(08:50)
And folks, you know, it’s really one way that I’ve said this before and I apologize for the press that travels with me for repeating it, but as I’d ride home-(09:03)
… that travels with me, from repeating it, but as I ride home at night, and usually I could get the seven o’clock, the last fast train. Now they call it the [cell oh 00:00:11] . It was then called the Metro, was at seven o’clock and I’d ride. You get outside the Beltway exit and you ride by all these neighbors. I look into windows and wonder, literally sitting there, looking out the window. What are those parents talking about at that dining room table tonight? What are they doing before, they put their kids to bed, right after they put the kids to bed and come back and sit down. My guess is they’re talking about the same things that we talked about all across the country, and we’re talking about today. They’re asking questions, and one of theirs, as profound as they’re ordinary. “Are we going to be okay? Are going to make it?”(09:50)
“What are we going to do? Who’s going to tell her we don’t have the money to go back to that community college. Who’s going to, you got to drive another 1000 miles on those bald tires. We just don’t have the money right now to get four new tires.” This election is about answering those kinds of questions. Who’s on their side? My dad used to have an expression for real. My dad, he didn’t have work when coal died and Scranton. My dad was a salesperson. He wasn’t a coal miner. My great-grandfather was a mining engineer, but my dad used to say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay’, and mean it.”(10:43)
That’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. It’s what I grew up with, surrounded by hard work and families and Scranton, Pennsylvania. When my dad had to move to Delaware, took us home to my grandpa for a year, but we finally got down. We got together again. That’s the discussions we had in Claymont and Scranton, like here in Cincinnati, but times are hard. Unemployment is up, due to the pandemic and economic outlook remains very uncertain and very mishandled. Across Ohio, and in this country folks are worried about making their next rent payment or mortgage payment, whether or not they’re going to be out in the street, whether or not they can purchase that prescription drug they need, or how much food they can put on the table.(11:38)
Making hard choices. Worry about whether the school their child is enrolled in, is going to be able to be open or what do they do if I still have a job, but I have a young child? If I go to work and their school’s not open, who takes care of them? How do we do that? They see the people at the top doing better and better, even in the midst of this God-awful recession, while they’re left to wonder. I mean, this sincerely, they’re have to wonder, “Who’s looking out for me?” That’s Donald Trump’s presence. 215,000 people dead from COVID-19. Experts are telling us, we may lose up to another 200,000 lives, by end of January, all because the president is only worried about one thing, the stock market, because he refused to follow science.(12:54)
It’s estimated that if we just wore masks, the mask I just took off to speak. Experts tell us, we could save between now and the end of the year, 100,000 lives. The president knew back in January. I think it was the 28th of January, when the intelligence community kept telling him how serious this pandemic would be. He knew it was extremely dangerous, an extremely communicable disease, airborne, but he didn’t tell anybody. But out of his desire to try to get Bob Woodward, to write something good about him, he did a long interview with Woodward, a famous journalist, and he went on record, on tape. He’s taped as saying, Trump is, that he knew how dangerous this disease was, but he did and said nothing except praise she, for the great service he was performing, how transparent he was.(14:07)
Ask yourself, why did he not tell the country? Or what, how much better off would it be, had he told the country. He said nothing. He told Bob Woodward, they didn’t want to panic the American public. Americans don’t panic. Trump panicked. Trump is the one who panicked, his reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis, as well, has been unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is president, the more reckless he gets. Dr. Fauci, the most respected person in this area, in the country, referred to the president’s announcement event, for the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden as a super-spreader event, publicly criticizing him.(15:06)
How is the president of responding? He’s running a national ad here in Cincinnati and all across the country, quoting Dr. Fauci out of context. Dr. Fauci said, back in March, referring to public health officials, “I can’t imagine anybody could be doing more,” referring to public health officials. But Trump and his campaign were very much used to deception and not telling the truth. Deliberately lie by putting Fauci in his ad, implying that Fauci was talking about Trump, saying he doesn’t know how anybody could do any better. Fauci, after he saw the ad, he went public. You’ve probably seen it on the nightly news. He came after that and he said, “I did not get permission for that quote to be used, and it wasn’t about the president.” Even after he said that, and the point, I listened to your talk, even after he said that, look what happened.(16:22)
They continued to lie. They said, “We’re keeping it in the ad.” Same ad that says, I’m going to increase taxes on middle-class folks, with the same amount of credibility. Look, they use the ad knowing it’s a lie. Can you remember any other major, mainstream presidential candidate ever doing something like these things? As a consequence of months of overwhelming lying, misleading, irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs are going to be around the dinner table tonight, because of their negligence? How many? How many brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, uncles, aunts, moms, dads are gone?(17:16)
Folks, we’re so much better than this. Despite the crisis we face, we have an enormous opportunity. Like America’s done, unlike any other country, after every crisis, we’ve always come out of the crisis stronger than we were before we went in. That’s the uniqueness of who we are. We now have an opportunity to build back and build back better, to get everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead, begin to reward work, not just wealth. For example, for communities of color here in Cincinnati and all across the country, the question is, “How do we break the cycle, wherein good times, they lag. In bad times, they get hit first and harder?”(18:03)
… where in good times they lag. In bad times, they get hit first and hardest. In a recovery, they’re the last and toughest to bounce back. The answer is justice, justice, criminal justice, police reforms. I know this nation is strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong on it to provide safe streets for our families and small businesses that too often bear the brunt of looting and burning, which is never justified. We have no need though for armed militia roaming the streets. We should have no tolerance for extremist White supremacist groups menacing our communities.(18:49)
Even reading what’s happening up in Michigan. The Governor is a good friend. They were in her driveway with assault weapons, standing there, because you can open carry in their state, attempting to intimidate. Remember, in, I was going to call it a debate, but the shouting match he engaged in, when he was asked by a Fox reporter, not a left wing somebody or other, would he condemn White supremacy, he never answered the question. I said, “What about those guys that you in fact talk about all the time,” those boys he talks about? He said, “Well, I would just tell them to stand back and stand by.” Neighborhoods I worked in, in the Black community in Delaware, that’s called a dog whistle. You say we should trust the American law enforcement authorities to their job as I do then let them do their job without extremest groups acting as vigilantes.(20:11)
If you say we have no need to face racial injustice in this country you haven’t opened your eyes to what’s been going on in this country and has for a long time. I decided to run for President and I hadn’t planned on it for real, but I decided to run when I saw those folks marching out of the fields in Charlottesville. Close your eyes and you remember what you saw on television? These White supremacist, Nazi sympathizers, carrying Nazi flags using the exact same jargon used, anti-Semitic jargon used as it was used in Germany in the ’30s, accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan and the Grand Kleagle saying, “This is why we elected him,” and a young woman ends up being killed. And I asked the President, “What do you think?” He said something no President has ever said, mark it down, ever said, “There are very fine people on both sides.”(21:28)
There have been very powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months. I’ve spent some time more, than one time, with George Floyd’s family and his little daughter, Gianna. And I knelt down to say hi to her and she said in a soft voice, “Daddy,” my word, this is a quote, “Daddy changed the world.” I also got to know Jacob Blake’s mom and dad and the whole family. Know what she said, she said, “Violence didn’t reflect her son,” that this nation needed healing, to stop the rioting, peacefully march, but there’s no justification for violence. One of the things that I’ve found, I’ve been in the civil rights arena for a long time and found pretty moving, was Doc Rivers, the basketball coach choking back tears. Remember what he said a couple of weeks ago? “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung,” continuing the quote. “It’s amazing why we keep loving this country and this country doesn’t love us back.”(22:52)
Think about that. Think about what it takes for a Black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country that for far too long has never been fully recognized. Trump talks about the lack of systemic racism and this is the first administration we’ve never met, “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men,” we’ve never met that standard. But every generation has moved closer and closer and closer to inclusion. It’s the first one, elected President, to deliberately try to turn it back in a big way. With all due respect, I think we need in America’s leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, open the lines of communication, and bring us back together to heal and to hope. As President, that’s precisely what I will do. That’s a President’s job, but it just goes beyond the issue of police-community relations.(24:14)
It goes about being able to compete and build wealth. It’s about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability, families of color building wealth, and being able to pass it down, like my Irish-Catholic folks were able to do in Scranton, coming up from nothing. You build home equity, you got something to pass on. For example, another example is more and more women are dropping out of the workforce in this recession whether they’re in a city or in the suburbs. I have a plan to deal with this pandemic responsibly. Testing, tracing, masking, not politicizing the race for a vaccine, a plan for its safe and equitable distribution, providing funding for PPE, the protective equipment and other resources for schools and businesses to be able to reopen safely. If you notice, the president said, when he was asked about his responsibility, he said, “I take no responsibility.” That was a quote. ” I take no responsibility.”(25:33)
No national standard has been set by this administration. Mr. Mayor, you’re doing on your own, or with your Governor or others in the community. We have to do so much and we can do so much. Ease the caregiving crisis for so many families experiencing now. That squeeze between raising your kids while caring for an aged loved one. It’s real. Protect your healthcare in the middle of this pandemic. Why do so many Republicans today have time told a hearing on the Supreme Court with 22 days left to go instead of providing significant economic recovery and needs for the people who are hurting so badly, Democrats and Republicans? Think about that. I handled the Recovery Act for our administration. $800 billion in 18 months with less than two-tenths of 1% waste or fraud. We had an Inspector General who looked over everything I did and I met with once every two weeks. Got $145 billion out to state and localities so you didn’t have to lay off …(27:03)
… billion dollars out to state and locality. So you didn’t have to lay off cops, firefighters, school teachers, nurses, first responders. What are we doing? Zip. The house acted, in the beginning of the summer, the so-called Heroes Act, to pay for all of this. States are in trouble. I’ll tell you why they’re not doing anything about it; two reasons. One, it’s all about wiping out the Affordable Care Act, which has been an obsession for this president since he became president. It was an Obama idea. Because no other nominee has said in the past that the law should be struck down. Not as a judge, [inaudible 00:00:27:59], that’s her view. That’s going to take health care coverage away from 20 million Americans. Because of his mishandling the economy and COVID, we’ve already lost 10 million people, have already lost their employer based health insurance, 10 million. That’s going to take away pre-existing conditions coverage for a hundred plus million Americans. And complications of COVID- 19 like lung scarring as well as heart damage, could well put how many millions more? There’s over 7 million people contracted COVID in the United States. What happens then? Pre-existing conditions can not be covered. It’s going to toss out the rule that allows children to be covered on their parents’ health care until age 26. It’s going to take us backwards. When insurance companies could charge a woman more for the same exact treatment that they charge a man. And pregnancy, once again, becomes a pre-existing condition. Folks, we can do so much better than this. Together we can build on the Affordable Care Act, writing a new health insurance option, a nonprofit public option, which is giving private insurers, a real competitor. Increase the subsidies, so premiums are lower and you can afford plans with lower deductibles, and lower out-of-pocket costs. We can only do any of this, if the country comes together.(29:47)
Last week, I went to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to the battlefield where Abraham Lincoln told us that a house divided cannot stand. Today, trust is ebbing, hope seems elusive. Instead of trying to heal his policies are ripping us apart.(30:16)
And those Republicans are willing to cooperate, get punished by this president. I refuse to let that happen. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country. I know that sounds bizarre in light of where we are. The spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I said that from the time I announced, I was told that, “Maybe that the way things used to work, Joe, you got a lot done before Joe, but you can’t do that anymore.” Well, I’m here to tell you and say we can, and we must, if we’re going to get anything done. Democracy requires consensus. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president.(31:11)
There will be no blue states and red states with me. It’s one America. I’ll work with Democrats and Republicans. I’ll work as hard for those who vote against me, as those who voted for me. That’s the job of a president, the duty to care, to care for everybody. We can disagree on policy, but you can still care. And you too have a sacred duty, in my humble opinion. As my friend, John Lewis said before he died, and while he was alive, “You have a sacred obligation to vote.” It matters. Ohio matters. You elected me and Barack in 2008 and 12.(31:59)
I’m asking for your support. I want to earn it, I’ll take nothing for granted. Asking for your support for Kamala and me in 2020. I promise we’ll always have your back. So please vote. Go to, I Will Vote.com/OH, now, to request your absentee ballot to vote by mail, to confirm your early voting location, to vote early in person, to find your polling place to vote in person on election day. Just make sure you have a plan.(32:39)
As a future congress woman said, “Bring along family, bring long friends, make their plans to vote as well.” No matter what, don’t let anybody discourage you and tell you your voice won’t be counted. It does. And don’t be intimidated by talk of having some of these Proud Boys stand there with their rifles in lines where you can open carry to try to intimidate people without saying anything. You, the American people decide our future; vote. And I’m convinced you’re going to turn out in large numbers.(33:22)
When I announced, I said I was running to restore America’s soul. Well its time to restore it. So it’s time to rebuild the backbone of this country, the middle class. This time, bring everybody along. No matter your race, your age, your gender, your religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability; everybody gets to come along. It’s time to unite America. And we’ll do that by choosing hope over fear, science over fiction, truth over lies, and unity over division. There’s nothing beyond the capacity of this nation when we stand together. So it’s time to stand up, take back our democracy, unite. And let’s, for the first time in a while, reflect the values that the vast majority of Americans hold. May God bless you. And may God bless our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

Good afternoon. My fellow Americans, last night, we saw the President of the United States, lie to the American people and repeatedly lie about the state of this pandemic. We saw him refuse to take responsibility for the crisis that should have been met with real presidential leadership. Instead it has cost hundreds of thousands of Americans lives and pushed millions into poverty. We saw him diminish the pain felt by so many Americans. President Trump said, “We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away. We’re learning to live with it.” There are quotes, but as I told them last night, We’re not learning to live with it, we’re learning to die with it.” This is a dark winter ahead. Already more than 220,000 people in the United States of America have lost their lives to this virus. 220,000 empty chairs at dinner tables all across this country. My heart goes out to every single person who’s had to endure the agony of saying goodbye to someone they loved and adored over a video chat, who couldn’t gather their closest friends, even their close family, to grieve together at a funeral mass or a funeral service.(03:07)
And worse yet, a new study from Columbia University suggests that anywhere between 130,000 and 210,000 of those deaths were avoidable. A leading medical journal in America, quite frankly in the world, wrote an unprecedented editorial. To the best of my knowledge, they’ve never written anything like this. They criticized President Trump’s quote, “Dangerously incompetent” end of quote, response. And stated that he quote, “Took a crisis and turned it into a tragedy.” COVID-19 dwarfs anything we faced in recent history. And it isn’t showing any signs of slowing down. The virus is surging in almost every state. We passed 4.8 million cases. And when Trump was asked this week, what he’d do differently to get the pandemic response right from the start. His answer was and I quote, “Not much, not much.” As many as 210,000 avoidable deaths, but there’s not much he would do differently. The United States is 4% of the entire world’s population. Yet we make up 20% of all the deaths worldwide. If this is a success, what’s a failure look like?(04:48)
We’re more than eight months into this crisis, and the president still doesn’t have a plan. He’s given up, he’s quit on you. He’s quit on your family. He’s quit on America. He just wants us to grow numb and resign to the horrors of this death toll and the pain it’s causing so many Americans. But he can’t erase his own words or deeds. In February, he knew just how dangerous this virus was. He told Bob Woodward in a taped interview, “This disease was deadly, far worse than the flu.” But instead of telling us how bad it was going to be, according to the New York times, his administration only gave Wall Street investors a head up heads up. And they made a bundle doing something called selling short, or betting against the market. So Wall Street knew what was coming, while the rest of us took the full brunt of it. In June, when we began to see the resurgence of COVID-19, I called out President Trump for wavering and waving the white flag of surrender to the virus.(06:10)
But then, it was as if he decided to go on offense for the virus, holding rallies with no masks, no social distancing, where people contracted the virus. Inviting the virus into the White House, hosting what Dr. Fauci called super spreader event. Endangering more people’s lives by telling the public, Don’t worry, don’t worry about the disease. Don’t let it dominate you.” How many people from Kristin and Arizona will end up suffering because their loved one listened to the President? Kristin said her dad voted for Trump, listened to him, believed him that the virus wasn’t a big deal. Then her dad became infected and died. Kristin said that her dad’s only preexisting condition… This is her quote. “The only preexisting issue was trusting Donald Trump.” End of quote. Even after contracting the virus himself, Donald Trump still, still refuses to promote universal mask wearing, which could have saved nearly 100,000 lives and could still save over 100,000 lives in the next few months.(07:28)
The longer Donald Trump is president, the more reckless he gets. We don’t have to be held prisoner by this administration’s failures. We can choose a different path. We can do what Americans have always done, come together and meet the challenge with grit, compassion, and determination. And today I’m going to tell you exactly what I plan to do if I have the honor of being elected your next president. I’ll immediately put in place a national strategy that will position our country to finally get ahead of this virus and get back our lives. I’ll reach out to every governor in every state, red and blue, as well as mayors and local officials during transition, to find out what support they need and how much of it they need. I’ll ask the new Congress to put a bill on my desk by the end of January, with all the resources necessary to see how both our public health and our economic response can be seen through the end, what is needed.(08:35)
Look, a pandemic doesn’t play favorites, nor will I. As I said, no red states, no blue states, just the United States. United in our response, united in our purpose to stop the spread of COVID-19 and beat this virus. First, I’ll go to every governor, urge them mandate mask wearing in their states. And if they refuse, I’ll go to the mayors and county executives and get local masking requirements in place nationwide. As president I’ll mandate masquerade in all federal buildings and all interstate transportation. Because masks save lives, period. Just look what happened in Arizona. The Republican Governor initially tried to bar local governments from implementing mandates on their communities. What happened? In June, Arizona got hit with a surge of cases. Hospitals were flooded. The State Health System was overwhelmed. So cities and counties appealed to the Governor’s ruling. They imposed their own local mandates covering most of the state. The result? Cases fell by 75%.(09:49)
Wearing a mask is not a political statement. It’s a scientific imperative. It’s a point of patriotic pride, so we can pull our country out of this godawful spiral we’re in. And it’s a testament to the values we were taught by our families and by our faiths, love thy neighbor as thyself. Second, I’ll put a national testing plan in place, with a goal of testing as many people each day as we’re currently testing each week. A seven fold increase. There’s a key difference in this campaign between Donald Trump and me, I believe in testing, Donald Trump does not. I believe in science. I believe in public health officials. I believe in the example of other countries, which prove that widespread testing is needed to regain the health of our nation, to reopen safely, and critically, to stay open. Every school, every worker, every American should have easy access to regular, reliable, free testing. To achieve this, we need to increase both lab based diagnostic testing, where the results back within 24 hours or less, and faster, cheaper screening tests that you can take right at home or in school.(11:17)
Look, we have right now isn’t anywhere near good enough. States are still improvising on the fly. School districts are still mostly on their own. And many Americans still don’t know when it’s important to get a test or how. This isn’t beyond our capacity to master. Not if we’re directing a coordinated effort across government and the private sector, instead of leaving chaos to reign. We’ll manufacture the lab supplies needed to make sure we have enough tests. And we’ll tap more of our nation’s lab capacity, so you can get your test results more quickly. We’ll build a national core of contact tracers to work closely with trusted organizations in these communities that are most at risk. We’ll also take steps to ensure that no one has to choose between getting a test and putting food on the table. And that no one, no one is scared that being tested for COVID might jeopardize their immigration status. The only way we’ll defeat this virus is if we defeat it everywhere.(12:35)
Third point I’d like to make is, we’ll close the personal protective equipment, that PPE gap, and get the gear outwards needed. Every healthcare worker will have a reliable supply of properly fitted N95 mask. It’s unconscionable. There are more than eight months into this crisis, and frontline healthcare workers are still rationing their personal protective equipment. As president I’ll use the full power of the Defense Production Act to drive the manufacturing of personal protective equipment, masks, gloves, gowns, and more, and ensure that it’s distributed equitably. Look, we won’t stop until the nation’s supply exceeds the demand and our stockpile is replenished, especially in hearted areas and in communities that are disproportionally impacted by the virus. I will appoint a fully empowered supply commander, who’s in charge of filling in the gaps, who’ll make sure we can manufacture critical supplies right here at home, so we’re not dependent on other countries in this crisis.(13:49)
Fourth, we’ll provide consistent, reliable, trusted, detailed, nationwide guidance, and technical support for reopening safely, and the resources to make it happen. We need a single source of guidance that we can trust, where we know the information won’t change by for any reason, other than the science that guides it. Not political expediency, not public image. It won’t be easy as to open or close. Social distancing isn’t an on or off thing. And we’re learning more every day about the virus and how it spreads. We need to be able to adapt and adjust our behavior to responsibly respond appropriately. But schools and businesses can’t make responsible decisions if they don’t have the information, the science. It’s not just more detail effective guidance they need. It’s consultations and technical support, so people have a place to turn with their questions. It’s having a government that’s in your corner, not a government that’s turned it’s back on you.(15:01)
And once we get our federal state and local governments working together, once those universal masking, enough PPE and testing to go around, science backed guidance to help us make the right decision, then we can get our kids back to school safely, our businesses growing and our economy running again without wasting another minute. As I said last night, I’m not going to shut down the economy. I’m not going to shut down the country. I’m going to shut down the virus. And finally, we focus on developing safe and effective treatments and distributing a safe and effective vaccine. President Trump claims he found a cure. Well, let me tell you. Yet we have 1000 people dying each day. More than 40,000 people are in hospitals right now, battling the virus. Lifesaving therapies shouldn’t be just available to the wealthy and the well connected. We need to make sure they’re available to everybody, available and affordable.(16:10)
It’s also possible we could learn any day that one of these vaccines currently in trial is showing itself to be effective. That will be a wonderful day for our people and people around the world, everywhere. Whether it comes next week or in the next two months. But it will still be many months before any vaccine is widely available. And we need a president who will take responsibility for making sure it gets to every single person in this country, in a way that’s equitable and accountable. We need a president who in the meantime is doing his job to protect the American people. Once we have a safe and effective vaccine, it has to be free to everyone, whether or not you’re insured. Let me say that again. The vaccine must be free and freely available to everyone. Is this just not one more reason why it’s so despicable that Donald Trump is fighting in the middle of a pandemic, to get the U.S Supreme Court to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, which I worked so damn hard to get the votes for.(17:23)
Under the ACA, insurers are required to cover recommended vaccines for free. So overturning the ACA would mean people have to pay to get the COVID-19 vaccine. That’s wrong, very, very wrong. Unlike Donald Trump, I believe healthcare isn’t a privilege, I think it’s a right. That’s why as president I’ll protect and build on the ACA by adding a public option that will compete with private plans to expand coverage and lower healthcare costs across the board. I’ll bring down drug prices by allowing Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies. I’ll make sure Americans have insurance. Those with insurance have access to free COVID-19 vaccine. And I’ll direct the Federal Government to bulk purchase as many doses as are necessary of the COVID-19 vaccine, so we can provide it free to those who are uninsured, underinsured, or Medicaid eligible. Throughout all of this, throughout all of this, yes, Mr. President, I’ll listen to the scientist and I’ll empower them.(18:41)
I know how much President Trump has damaged faith in our institutions, in our leaders, in Government itself. We have to rebuild the trust between the public and it’s public servants. It’s one of the most difficult task we’ll face in the coming years. But if I’m elected president, I’ll always give it to you, as FDR said, “Straight from the shoulder.” I’ll deliver on my promises. I’ll listen to the American people, no matter what their politics. I’ll let the doctors and the scientists speak freely, so you can make the best decision possible for yourself and for your family. And I won’t let four years of Donald Trump rob us of most fundamental American qualities, our hope in the future and our faith in ourselves. We can beat this virus. We’re not too divided to achieve big things. We’re America. We can do this. We’ve never failed when we worked together. Imagine, imagine a true nationally coordinated plan where we spare no expense, so our schools have the resources needed to reopen with full health and safety protocols in place.(19:52)
Imagine every small business getting a restart package that helps cover the cost of installing plexiglass, providing PPE and more, to minimize the risk of exposure for customers and workers. Imagine our older Americans and people with disabilities having the peace of mind that comes with trusting that the public health system is working for them. Imagine, instead of staying locked up in their rooms, they’re able to hug their grandchildren or other those who they love and haven’t been able to see. Imagine if you’re a member of a community that has been hit particularly hard, black, Latino, Asian Americans, or Native Americans. Imagine a public health and economic response that treats your needs as a priority, not as an afterthought. Imagine a day in the not too distant future, when you could enjoy dinner with your friends and your family, maybe even go out to a movie. When you can celebrate your birthday, weddings, graduations, surrounded by your nearest and dearest friends. That’s the Biden-Harris agenda to beat COVID-19.(21:07)
It’s going to take all of us working together. And that’s not hyperbole. All of us working together. Watching out for one another. We’re all still going to have to wear a mask, a practical social distancing a while longer. It’s going to be hard, but if we follow the science and keep faith with one another, I promise you we’ll get through this and come out the other side much faster than the rate we’re going now. Look, you all know this, the American people have always given their best to this country in times of crisis. And this time isn’t any different. I’m not joking when I say this, I think every day about the brave doctors and nurses and hospital workers, police officers, firefighters, EMTs, and other first responders who not figuratively, but literally are putting their lives on the line day in and day out to care for people. I think of the essential workers who carried the rest of us on their shoulders through these many months. The grocery store clerks, the delivery clerks, the drivers.(22:22)
The folks on the assembly line, the meat packers, and so many more. People too often overlooked, too often overlooked, under compensated. They’ve given the best to their country when we needed them the most. Think of the small businesses who moved heaven and earth to try to take care of their employees and keep their businesses open. And sadly, of all those who couldn’t because they didn’t get the help they were promised. I think in the parents juggling working from home with the added demands of overseeing their child’s educations. I think about the educators who are spending hours learning how to teach online. They’re doing what they always do, giving above and beyond for their students. I think of the families and the communities who’ve stepped up, donating to charities, doing grocery runs for older relatives and neighbors, finding new ways to connect and support one another. That’s the America we know. That’s the United States of America. That’s who we are.(23:32)
And like John F. Kennedy, when he committed to take us to the moon, he said, “I refuse to postpone the possibilities that exist for this country.” I refuse to postpone. I refuse to postpone the American purpose that’ll not only lead our country back, but lead the entire world. There’s no challenge. There’s no challenge We cannot meet. No enemy we’re unable to face. No threat we can’t conquer. We stand together united, bound by our common resolve, determination, and values. Folks, together we can harness the unlimited potential of the American people, not just to get back where we were before this virus hit us, but to get back better. I promise you. And you know it in your heart we can do this. We must do this and we will do it together. You know we can do it. This is the United States of America.(24:42)
May God bless you all. And may God protect our frontline workers and all those who have lost a loved one. Thank you and keep the faith."
biden_speech_coronavirus.txt,"(00:01)
We talked about school openings. We talked about the distribution of a vaccine, if and when one arrives, and what plans would be made for. We talked significantly about the racial disparities that exist and how COVID-19 is affecting different races differently, and we talked about the continued lack of PPE protective equipment and testing capacity and the like. I’ve put out a comprehensive plan over the last three months on each of these things, but today I want to talk about one thing. Very straightforward. Doesn’t have anything to do with Democrats, Republicans or independents. It has to do with a single simple proposition: every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum. Every governor should mandate. Every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing. The estimates by the experts are it will save over 40,000 lives in the next three months. 40,000 lives if people act responsibly.(01:25)
And it’s not about your rights, it’s about your responsibilities as an American. The fact is that as Americans are lining up to give blood, Americans volunteer all their time for food banks and local charities, supporting their neighbors that are in need. Well, this is no different. Wearing a mask is less about you contracting the virus, although it does help depending on the mask, but it’s about preventing other people from getting sick. Wearing a mask will give the life of a clerk or your local store or your letter carrier, your child’s teacher, it will increase their prospects of not contracting the virus. Even though it’s uncomfortable, we’re not used to it, wearing a mask is going to get our kids back to school sooner and safer. Wearing a mask, every American wearing a mask outdoors, is going to get our businesses back and the full strength long-term, and we’re going to get our country back on track.(02:31)
But again, when I get occasionally confronted with a person in the public about wearing a mask, I say, “Look, this is America. Be a Patriot. Protect your fellow citizens. Protect your fellow citizens. Step up. Do the right thing. Do the right thing.” There’s overwhelming evidence that the mask and depending on the type of mask you wear increases exponentially the prospect that you, if you are a carrier and you don’t even know it, that you will not infect anyone when you cough, sneeze, sing, shout.(03:17)
A lot of people are dying. We’re up over 160,000 people dead so far. And I’ll end by saying that it goes back to the study some months ago by Columbia University saying that we didn’t have to be this way. If the president had acted sooner, just one week earlier, it would have saved 30-some-thousand lives. Two weeks earlier, I think it was 51,000 or 57,000 lives. I hope we’ve learned a lesson. Hope the president has learned a lesson, but again, this is not about Democrat, Republican or independent. It’s about saving America’s lives, so let’s Institute a mass mandate nationwide starting immediately, and we will save lives. The estimates are we’ll save over 40,000 lives in the next three months if that is done.(04:12)
Now, let me turn it over to my colleague and running mate. She has a few comments to make. [inaudible 00:04:20]. (07:16)
We’ll talk about that later."
biden_speech_covid.txt,"(00:00)
We thank the local officials for joining today. I know they’ve got a lot to do and they’ve really been very, very busy. Before I begin my remarks, I want to acknowledge that it was five years ago today when a white supremacist walked into Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina and slaughtered a friend of mine, Clementa Pinckney, and eight other parishioners. It was hate unbridled, and it was poisonous, a poisonous expression of white supremacy that still infects our nation and many of our institutions and of the dangers we face as a society if we don’t root out this corrosive and deadly ideology.(00:51)
When I reflect back on the amazing grace and compassion and forgiveness of the Mother Emanuel community, I see the very best in what we see in America as Americans, but we know that grace alone is not enough. We have to put it to work, that grace, and we’re seeing the best of America in that as well. In the weeks of peaceful protest, civil action is taking place in cities and towns of every size, in this state and every other state across the country. People are keeping their eyes focused on how danger it is, how much danger it is to live a life of a black or a brown-skinned person in this country, and Americans are out there marching, notwithstanding the fact that we’re in the middle of a pandemic. That’s how critical they think it is.(01:50)
On Monday, Donald Trump said, “If we stopped testing right now for COVID-19, we’d have very few cases if any.” If we stopped testing, we’d have very few cases if any. It’s a statement that’s not only absurd, it’s absolutely tragic. Yesterday, the head of the White House task force on coronavirus, the vice president, claimed success in the fight because deaths are “down to fewer than 750 a day.” 750 fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers, uncles, aunts, husbands, wives, children dying every day. More than 20,000 a month. That’s greater than World War II level casualties each month, that’s more than five 9/11s each month, and this administration is engaging in self-congratulations? Maybe good enough for Donald Trump, but it will never, ever be acceptable if I’m your president. Researchers have shown that tens of thousands of Americans have died needlessly because Donald Trump was slow to respond to the crisis and then when he did he bungled the response.(03:22)
For weeks in January and February, I but I wasn’t alone, I was raising my concerns about how we need to take this virus seriously, all while Trump was ignoring the reporting from his own intelligence community in his daily briefings, and the warnings of his closest advisors, all the while praising the Chinese government for being transparent in handling this virus instead of demanding access for the CDC that Beijing was refusing to give in Wuhan. The American people have sacrificed so much to fight this virus. We’ve lost lives, we’ve lost businesses, we’ve lost paychecks, and now thanks to Donald Trump’s bungling, we may lose some of the progress we begun to make. All because he’s lost interest. He’s once again ignoring the facts. The public health response is still woefully, woefully lacking from this administration. More than 117,000 people have died in the United States of America, with an average daily number of cases still climbing in 21 states.(04:51)
We still don’t have what we need when it comes to rapid results testing, contact tracing capacity, widely available personnel protective equipment for them, or clear nationwide guidance. Instead, President Trump pushes dangerous disproven drugs, stands in the way of the CDC issuing guidelines on reopening. They had them, wanted to issue them and he wouldn’t let them. He refuses to wear a mask, failing even the most basic test of leadership. He scaled back meetings of the COVID-19 task force. I guess there’s not much to do in spite of experts saying that testing and tracing is necessary for reopening, he sent his testing czar home. The money provided to the Pentagon for essential medical supplies, only 15%, only 15% has made it out the door.(06:11)
Donald Trump wants to style himself as a wartime president against this invisible enemy, the coronavirus. Unlike any other war, any other wartime leader, he takes no responsibility, he exercises no leadership, and now he’s just flat surrendering the fight. Instead of leading the charge to defeat the virus, he just basically waved a white flag and has retreated [inaudible 00:06:45] to get back on his campaign, to his campaign rallies that he’ll put people at risk as everyone’s pointed out, in violation of the CDC Guidelines that still warn against large gatherings as long as he’s going to allow this to happen, but he’s ready to do it as long as, notwithstanding CDC guidance, as long as the people showing up sign a waiver promising they’ll not hold the campaign liable.(07:20)
Donald Trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk. Job numbers and retail sales were better than expected in May, and that’s great news for the country, but now Donald Trump’s desire to declare victory and be done with it is only going to imperil the continued progress we have to make. Our economy is still sputtering, with more than 20 million people unemployed and no clear guidance from the federal government for what businesses need to do to reopen safely, efficiently, and generate a strong recovery.(08:16)
This isn’t a debate about whether to reopen. It’s about how we make reopening work for everyone. The employees at the White House, they get daily COVID-19 tests. They know they’re safe before they go to work and they know their co-workers are safe. They have the confidence to resume their lives. Workers across the country aren’t asking for daily testing. They’re just asking for regular, reliable access to tests. Don’t they deserve that?(08:55)
So it’s not that Donald Trump doesn’t recognize the importance of testing, it’s that he’s not up to the task or doesn’t care and now he’s seemingly decided he doesn’t even want to try, but just like he couldn’t wish COVID-19 away in March, just like he couldn’t tweet it away in April, he can’t ignore it away in June. So I have some basic questions for President Donald Trump. What are you going to do to make sure every worker has access to regular testing so they have the same confidence to go into a store or go back to work that White House staffers have? Why are you leaving schools and child care centers to navigate the uncertainty all on their own without an effective guidance and resources that they need to protect the kids and their communities? Why don’t you enforce the OSHA standards for worker protection during this global pandemic? Why is it the Main Street Lending Program created more than two months ago by the Congress to help struggling small businesses only opened for registration to lenders two days ago, and still hasn’t distributed a single penny. Why don’t you disclose the names, Mr. President, of the businesses that received a total of $500 billion in taxpayer’s funding? Why are they being hidden?(10:49)
How many cronies got bailouts? How many donors? How many big businesses that didn’t need it? What business had to shut down because they were denied funding in April? What businesses didn’t get special approval that others got by a nod from the top? Why did you get rid of the watchdog, Mr. President? Why did you get rid of the watchdog, appointed to oversee every dollar distributed, an inspector general? Why did you get rid of that person the Congress passed? What are you trying to hide? It’s bad management on top of bad planning on top of neglect and it’s totally unacceptable for a great nation like ours.(11:55)
Folks, here’s the truth. The pandemic is still here. It’s going to be here for the foreseeable future until we get it under control or until we have safe and proven widely available vaccine. COVID-19 is a fact of nature. We have to deal with this virus and everything that comes with it. We have to deal with it head on, honestly, tell the people the truth. To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt in the Depression, the American people can handle anything, just tell them the truth. We can’t deal with it the way you’re doing it. The only way to deal with it, Mr. President, if we put in the work, investing and building a dynamic, resilient economy and health system capable of getting and then staying ahead of new outbreaks. We have the capacity and the resources to do that. I have laid out baseline steps of what needs to be done from make it work checklists for a successful accountable recovery that I put out back in early April to the steps for a strong reopening that I released last week. It’s not rocket science. Granted I have incredible scientists advising me on almost a daily basis on how to proceed, but it’s not rocket science, it’s common sense.(13:35)
It’s straightforward, and that’s why this is perhaps the greatest indictment of Donald Trump’s complete, compelling lack of leadership. He wasted months and months and months passing the buck, blaming everyone else, refusing to act when he should have been preparing our country for a longterm response and building our resiliency to respond to future flareups. Yet we still don’t have a comprehensive system for collecting COVID-19 case data. These are the basics. He should have been preparing us to weather the valleys and peaks of this virus. He should have been working to shore up the vulnerabilities in our healthcare system that have been laid bare in this crisis that he’s trying to eliminate in court. He should have been working to bridge the inequities and strengthen the cracks in the foundation of our economic system that are exposed for everyone to see. He hasn’t done any of it. Because of the depth of Donald Trump’s failures, this pandemic will continue to be worse for all Americans and much worse for black and brown Americans who are getting hit the hardest.(15:03)
Folks in communities like [inaudible 00:15:06], Donald Trump thinks if he puts his head in the sand, the American people will too, but it doesn’t work that way. Not when hundreds of people are still dying every day and millions are unemployed wondering how in God’s name are they going to keep the lights on and food on the table. Not when workers are weighed down with worries about their safety or what happens if they get sick. There are the steps that we need to be taking now to steer us steadily and strongly in the right direction, see us through this time, to make a more resilient future. They’re all available.(15:44)
First, we have to do everything we can to avoid deadly spikes in the infections as people begin to back out into the world. We’re not that much better prepared today for the run of cases that overfills our intensive care units than we were three months ago. Second, we have to help give people the assurance and precautions that are necessary to restart the economy with confidence. If Americans lose what faith they have left, what little faith they have left in the government’s ability to manage this pandemic, we’ll see much deeper and longer lasting economic impacts than we even, and with even greater repercussions for people’s well-being.(16:38)
Mr. President, don’t leave the American people to face this threat on their own with no guidance, resources, or leadership from the federal government. Don’t let support from the CARES Act expire next month while people are still hurting. Don’t leave our frontline workers exposed without the resources they need and don’t waste any more of our time, Mr. President. The American people need confidence and clear guidance grounded in science that’s going to allow them to resume their daily lives. American businesses need the support of the federal government to continue to backstop them through this phases of reopening and workers need assurances that their health is your first concern. Americans need a president who will put the American people first, not his or her own ego. America needs a president who will do the work. I’m ready on Day One, after more than three years in office, why isn’t Donald Trump ready? Mr. President, wake up. Get to work. There is so much more to be done. Thank you."

Senator Harris and I just completed briefings on both COVID and the economic crisis facing this nation, and we’re reminded again of the severity of this pandemic. Cases are on the rise nationwide and we’re nearing 240,000 deaths due to COVID, and our hearts go out to each and every family has lost a loved one to this terrible disease.(02:19)
In America, the vote is sacred. It’s how people of this nation express their will, and it is the will of the voters, no one, not anything else, that chooses the President of the United States of America. So each ballot must be counted and that’s what we’re going to see going through now, and that’s how it should be.(02:44)
Democracy is sometimes messy. It sometimes requires a little patience as well, but that patience has been rewarded now for more than 240 years with a system of governance, and that’s been the envy of the world, and we continue to feel, senator and I, we continue to feel very good about where things stand.(03:06)
We have no doubt that when the count is finished, Senator Harris and I will be declared the winners. So I ask everyone to stay calm, all people to stay calm. The process is working. The count is being completed and we’ll know very soon. So thank you all for your patience, but we’ve got to count the votes. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much."

How y’all doing? My name’s Joe Biden. I’m a car guy and I got a ’67 Corvette that’s Goodwood green. That’s a 60… That’s not a 67. That’s a 427. That thing gets up and goes. Anyway. Choir, you must be freezing. Freezing to death. Well, I tell you what, man, you ought to huddle on the bus or something. Folks, I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you being here. What time is it now? Seven o’clock at night, cold as the devil and your here. And I thank you very, very much. Detroit, there’s no better, no more appropriate place to hold a drive-in rally than in motor city USA.(01:01)
I want to thank Everett. I want to thank Everett for sharing his story with us and for the unfailing dedication that you and so many of your proud union educators, we owe you. We owe you big for those students and families you take care of during these difficult times. I’m married. I’m Jill Biden’s husband. She’s an educator. So, that’s what teaching is. It’s just not she does. It’s who she is. So Everett, thank you. And folks, look. I also want to thank the incredible leaders who are here today. My good friend, Mayor Duggan and mayor Duggan and I spent an awful lot of time together trying to get Detroit back. He got it back on the upside, but I was here trying to get to all the help he could possibly get to get it done. As Vice President I’m fighting to support this city, invest in the revitalization of the future of Detroit, because I’ve always believed in Detroit, not just saying that. My dad was an automobile man.(02:00)
That’s what got me through school. That’s what everything was about. And I’ve always believed in Michigan. We have the finest auto workers in the world here in Michigan. That’s not hyperbole. That’s a fact. I want to thank you, Chairwoman Barnes. Thank you very, very much. And Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist, you’ve been a good friend. And Governor Whitmer, you’ve been an incredible leader. She’s been tested and proven under crisis conditions and extraordinary circumstances.(02:30)
Your leadership through this pandemic has saved countless lives of Michiganders here, Gov. That’s a fact. And you’ve shown the whole nation just how tough you are. Michigan tough. I’m proud to call you a friend. And Senator Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, thank you for fighting for the people of Michigan who need help now, but aren’t getting it because the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, cares more about shoving through our Supreme Court nomination to take away your health care than he does helping the hurting people in this city, this state in this country. We can’t forget that winning in November doesn’t just mean defeating Donald Trump. It means winning back the United States Senate and expanding our majority in the House of Representatives. That’s why we need to send Gary back to Washington, DC.(03:20)
I really mean it. We need him. That’s the guy who knows what he believes and says what he believes and does what he believes. And alongside Debbie Stabenow for the people in Michigan, but not quite frankly for the whole country. Folks, as my coaches to say, it’s go time. This is the most important election of our lifetimes. And you can make all the different here in Michigan. The choice is as clear as ever, and the stakes are higher than ever. The stakes in this election remind me of something my dad used to say. He said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in your communities. Be able to look your child in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it.” Well, that’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten.(04:13)
That’s what I grew up surrounded by, hard work and families. In Scranton, Pennsylvania. Claymont, Delaware. How many people today though, can look their kids in the eye and say, “Everything’s going to be all right,” and mean it? These times are hard. Unemployment is way up due to the pandemic. Just this week, over a million, 200,000 more people file for unemployment. The economic outlook for next year remains uncertain and across Michigan and the country, folks are worried about making their next rent payment or their mortgage payment or their car payment. They’re worried whether or not they can purchase the prescription drug they need or put food on the table, have to make a choice. Worried about sending their kids to school or worried about not sending their kids to school. They see the people at the top doing a hell of a lot better while the rest are left to wonder, “Who’s looking out for me?” That’s Donald Trump’s presidency.(05:14)
More than 215… I think it’s now 217,000, dead Americans because of COVID-19. And experts say we’ll lose nearly 200,000 more lives in the next few months, all because this President cares more about his Park Avenue perspective on the world and the stock market than he does about you. Because we refuse to follow the science. It’s estimated if we just wore these masks between now and the end of the year, we’d save 100,000 lives. Folks, you know what’s really sad about all this? The President knew. He knew back in January how dangerous this virus was.(05:59)
And he hid it from the American people. He told the journalist Bob Woodward in a taped interview the disease was deadly. In January. Deadly and far worse than the flu and airborne. But here’s what he did. According to the New York Times today, his administration gave Wall Street investors a heads up about it. Didn’t tell us, but gave Wall Street Investors a head up, but the American people, he said nothing. That’s why they made so much money by quote, “Selling short.” They knew what was coming. But what happened to the rest of us? He told Bob Woodward he didn’t want to panic the American people. We don’t panic. He panicked.(06:53)
This personal conduct since his diagnosis has been unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is President, the more reckless he gets. Dr. Fauci, the leading expert in the country, referred to the President’s announcement on the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden, as quote, “A super spreader event causing so many people to get COVID.” And how did Trump respond? He responded by running a national ad, taking Dr. Fauci’s words out of context.(07:27)
Dr. Fauci said way back in March a quote, “I can’t imagine that anybody could be doing more.” Referring to the public health officials. Then Trump took that quote out of context and put it into a campaign ad deliberately lying, making a sound like Dr. Fauci was talking about him. Even after Fauci asked him to take the ad down, trump’s campaign said they’d continue to use the ad, knowing it was a lie. That behavior is no surprise. After all, this is the same man who looks at Americans who put their lives on the line, like my son put the lives on the line to save our nation, calls them losers and suckers. My son Beau spent a year in Iraq, won the bronze star of the conspicuous service medal. He was no sucker.(08:20)
And the people he left behind were heroes. And now, as a consequence of this overwhelming lying, misleading irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs are there going to be around the dining room table tonight because of his negligence? Folks, we’re so much better than this as a country. Despite the crisis we face, we have an enormous opportunity to build back better. The American people have had the blinders off to replace Donald Trump’s incentives for companies to ship jobs overseas, with rental policies and tax credits, to revitalize American manufacturing, to make it in America, make it in Michigan, buy American.(09:12)
Look. We’re going to do everything to give everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead. For example, in communities of color here in Detroit and all across the country, the question is, “How do we break the cycle?” Where in good times, you lag behind. In bad times, you’re the first hit and hit the hardest. And in recovery, you’re the last ones the bounce back. The answer is about justice. Criminal justice, policing reform. This nation is strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong enough to ride safe streets for our families and small businesses that too often bear the brunt of looting and burning. We have no need for armed militias roaming America’s streets, and we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacist group, menacing our country. These guys are hatching violent and deranged schemes, like the one against Governor Whitmer that the FBI and local law enforcement uncovered and stopped last week. But make no mistake, that was a planned act of terrorism.(10:29)
A plot. Think of this. A plot in the United States of America to blow up a bridge on American soil, to threaten the lives of police officers, to kidnap an American leader. That’s the sort of behavior you might expect from ISIS that should shock the conscience of every American to see that sort of twisted thinking take root here in America. What all President does, Trump does, is fan the flames of hatred and division in this country. Telling the proud boys in the debate with me. When I said, “Will you condemn them? He said, “I’ll tell them to stand back and stand by.” What the hell’s the matter with this guy? Attacking Governor Whitmer on the same day this plot was exposed. It’s despicable. And by the same measure, if you say we have no need to face racial injustice in this country, you haven’t opened your eyes to the truth of America today.(11:31)
There’ve been powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months. George Floyd’s six year old daughter, who I met with when I met the family. Jean. I knelt down to say hi to her, and looked at me and said, “Daddy, change the world.” Jacob Blake’s mother, another one, when I met with her, said violence doesn’t reflect who her son is and the nation needs healing and said she’s praying for the police officers. Or [Doc Rivers 00:12:02], the basketball coach, choking back tears when he said, quote, “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’d been hung. It’s amazing why we keep loving this country and this country doesn’t love us back.”(12:15)
Think about that. Think about what it takes to be a black person who loves America today. That is a deep love of this country that has far too long, has not been fully recognized. What we need in America us leadership to seek to deescalate tensions, to open the lines of communications, to bring us back together again, to heal, to hope. As President that’s precisely what I’ll do, but true justice is also about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability, families of color building wealth, passing it down.(12:54)
That’s how I deliver equality and equity. Another example, more and more women are dropping out of the workplace because of the recession or in a city or out in the suburbs. I have a plan to deal with the pandemic responsibly. New testing, tracing, masking, not politicizing the race for vaccine. Planning for safe and equitable distribution, providing PPE and other resources for schools to reopen safely. Ease the caregiving crisis that so many families are experiencing. Squeezed between raising your kid and caring for your aging loved ones. And protect your health care. In the middle of this pandemic why didn’t Republicans have the time, as I said, to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court, instead of addressing the significant economic needs of local communities? I’ll tell you why. It’s about wiping out Obamacare. Wiping it off the books, because their nominee has said in the past that the law should be struck down.(13:56)
He’s going to take away healthcare coverage for 20 million Americans. They’ll also take away protections for preexisting conditions that more than a hundred million people in America have. Complications of COVID-19 will also add to that. Lung scarring, heart damage could well become the next pre-existing condition. That will toss out the rule that allows children to be covered on their parents’ health insurance till age 26. Will take us backwards to when insurance companies could charge a woman more for healthcare than a man, just because she’s a woman. Folks, we can do so much better together. I’ll build on the Affordable Care act, where you can choose to keep your private insurance as well as offer Medicaid like public option, which will give private insurance real competition. We’re going to increase subsidies so your premiums are lower. You can afford a plan with lower deductibles, lower out-of-pocket spending.(14:58)
Folks, we can only do this if we come together as a country. Abraham Lincoln told us that a house divided cannot stand. Today, trust is ebbing. Hope seems elusive. And instead of healing, we’re being ripped apart. I refuse to let that happen. We need to revive a spirit of bipartisan in this country. A spirit of being able to work with another. When I say that I’m told that used to be the way, Joe, used to get a lot of things done, but things have changed. Well, I’m here to tell you it can happen again. And they must. It must if we’re ever going to get anything done. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American President.(15:52)
I work with Democrats and Republicans. That’s why so many Republican leaders have endorsed me. They know I’ve done it and we’ll do it again. For those who don’t support me as well as those who do, folks that’s the job of a President, the duty to care, the duty to heal. And you, too, have a sacred duty. As my friend, John Lewis used to say, “Vote. It matters.” Michigan matters. You elected me and Barack Obama in 2012. And you bet on us when we bet on you and bet on American workers. We bet on the UAW. I’m asking for your trust and support in 2020 for Kamala and me. We’ll always have your back. I promise you. So please, vote. Help us get out the vote. Go to iwillvote.com/mi and Detroit, more than 20 years. Look, you have now 20 early voting centers. They’re open now all across the city.(17:06)
Open seven days a week and election day. It’s a one-stop shop. You can go get registered and vote right then and there. So don’t wait. Vote today. Tell everyone you know. Everyone you meet, vote. Vote. Vote. And no matter what, don’t let anybody discourage you or tell you your vote won’t count because it does.(17:29)
You, the American people are going to decide the future of this country. Vote. It’s time to restore America’s soul. It’s time to rebuild the backbone of this country. The middle class and unions built the middle class. No matter what your age, race, or gender. Folks, folks, look. It’s time to unite America. It really is.(17:51)
I’ll never forget what President Kennedy said about going to the moon. My colleagues in the Senate used to kid me by raising it when I’d bring it up in a caucus. He answered the question that was on everybody’s lips but nobody asked. “Why are we doing this?” He said, “We’re doing it because we refuse to postpone.” I refuse to postpone any longer the work America must do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to America’s future. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. Look, everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s show them who we are. We choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies. It’s time to stand up, take back our country. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Go get him. We can do this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
biden_speech_dnc.txt,"(00:00)
The civil rights movement left us with this wisdom, give people light and they will find the way. Give people light. Those are words for our time. The current president has cloaked America in darkness for much too long. Too much anger, too much fear, too much division. Here and now I give you my word, if you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I’ll be an ally of the light, not the darkness. It’s time for us, for we the people to come together. And make no mistake. United we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America. We’ll choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege. I’m a proud Democrat, and I’ll be proud to carry the banner of our party into the general election. So it’s with great honor and humility, I accept this nomination for president of the United States of America.(01:14)
But while I’ll be a democratic candidate, I will be an American president. I’ll work hard for those who didn’t support me, as hard for them as I did for those who did vote for me. That’s the job of a president. To represent all of us, not just our base or our party. This is not a partisan moment. This must be an American moment. It’s a moment that calls for hope, and light, and love. Hope for our future, light to see our way forward, and love for one another. America isn’t just a collection of clashing interest, of red states or blue states. We’re so much bigger than that. We’re so much better than that. Now, nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt pledged a new deal in a time of massive unemployment, uncertainty, and fear. Stricken by a disease, stricken by a virus, FDR insisted that he would recover and prevail and he believed America could as well. And he did and we can as well.(02:23)
This campaign isn’t just about winning votes. It’s about winning the heart, and yes, the soul of America. Winning it for the generous among us, not the selfish. Winning it for workers who keep this country going, not just the privileged few at the top. Winning it for those communities who have known the injustice of a knee on the neck. For all of the young people who have known only America being a rising inequity and shrinking opportunity. They deserve the experience of America’s promise. They deserve to experience it in full. No generation never knows what history will ask of it. All we can ever know is whether we’re ready when that moment arrives. And now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments America’s ever faced. Four, four historic crises, all at the same time. A perfect storm, the worst pandemic in over a hundred years, the worst economic crisis since The Great Depression, the most compelling call for racial justice since the sixties and the undeniable [inaudible 00:03:37] and just the accelerating threats of climate change.(03:44)
So the question for us is simple. Are we ready? I believe we are. We must be. All elections are important but we know in our bones, this one is more consequential. As many have said, America’s at an inflection point, a time of real peril, but also of extraordinary possibilities. We can choose a path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, more divided, a path of shadow and suspicion, or we can choose a different path and together take this chance to heal, to reform, to unite, a path of hope and light. This is a life-changing election. This will determine what America is going to look like for a long, long time. Character is on the ballot, compassion is on the ballot, decency, science, democracy, they’re all on the ballot. Who we are as a nation, what we stand for, and most importantly, who we want to be, that’s all on the ballot. And the choice could not be more clear. No rhetoric is needed. Just judge this president on the facts.(05:01)
5 million Americans infected by COVID-19. More than 170,000 Americans have died. By far the worst performance of any nation on earth. More than 50 million people have filed for unemployment this year. More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year. Nearly one in six, small businesses have closed this year. And this president, if he’s re-elected, you know what will happen. Cases and deaths will remain far too high. More mom and pop businesses will close their doors, and this time for good. Working families will struggle to get by, and yet the wealthiest 1% will get tens of billions of dollars in new taxes breaks and the assault on the Affordable Care Act will continue until it’s destroyed, taking insurance away from more than 20 million people, including more than 15 million people on Medicaid, and getting rid of the protections that President Obama worked so hard to get passed for a hundred million more people who have preexisting conditions.(06:16)
And speaking of President Obama, a man I was honored to serve alongside for eight years as vice president. Let me take this moment to say something we don’t say nearly enough. Thank you, Mr. President, you were a great president, a president that our children could and did look up to. No one’s going to say that about the current occupant of the White House. What you know about this president is if he’s given four more years, he’ll be what he’s been for the last four years. The president takes no responsibility, refuses to lead, blames others, cozies up to dictators, and fans the flames of hate and division. He’ll wake up every day believing that job is all about him, never about you. Is that the America you want for you, your family, your children? I see a different America, one that’s generous and strong, selfless, and humble. It’s an America we could rebuild together.(07:21)
As president the first step I will take would be to get control of the virus that has ruined so many lives because I understand something this president hasn’t from the beginning, we will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back in schools, we’ll never have our lives back until we deal with this virus. The tragedy of where we are today is it didn’t have to be this bad. Just look around. It’s not this bad in Canada, or Europe, or Japan, or almost anywhere else in the world. And the president keeps telling us, the virus is going to disappear. He keeps waiting for a miracle. Well, I have news for him. No miracle is coming. We lead the world in confirmed cases, we lead the world in deaths. Our economy is in tatters, with Black, Latino, Asian-American, Native American communities bearing the brunt of it. And after all this time, the president still does not have a plan.(08:28)
Well, I do. If I’m your president, on day one, we’ll implement the national strategy I’ve been laying out since March. We’ll develop and deploy rapid tests for the results available immediately. We’ll make the medical supplies and protective equipment that our country needs, and we’ll make them here in America, so we will never again be at the mercy of China or other foreign countries in order to protect our own people. We’ll make sure our schools have the resources they need to be open, safe, and effective. We’ll put politics aside. We’ll take the muzzle off our experts, so the public gets the information they need and deserve, honest unvarnished truth. They can handle it. We’ll have a national mandate to wear a mask, not as a burden, but as a patriotic duty to protect one another. In short, we’ll do what we should have done from the very beginning. Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to the nation. He’s failed to protect us. He’s failed to protect America. And my fellow Americans, that is unforgivable.(09:50)
As president, I’ll make you a promise. I’ll protect America, I will defend us from every attack, seen and unseen, always, without exception, every time. Look, I understand. I understand how hard it is to have any hope right now. On this summer night, let me take a moment to speak to those you who have lost the most. I have some idea how it feels to lose someone you love. I know that deep black hole that opens up in the middle of your chest and you feel like you’re being sucked into it. I know how mean, and cruel, and unfair life can be sometimes. But I’ve learned two things. First, your loved one may have left this earth, but they’ll never leave your heart. They’ll always be with you, you always hear them. And second, I’ve found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose. As God’s children, each of us have a purpose in our lives.(11:01)
We have a great purpose as a nation to open the doors of opportunity to all Americans, to save our democracy, to be a light to the world once again, and finally, to live up to and make real the words written in the sacred documents that founded this nation, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among them, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. My dad was an honorable, decent man. He got knocked down a few times, pretty hard, but he always got back up. He worked hard and he built a great middle class life for our family. He used to say, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure in hell expect them to understand them.” And then he’d say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it.”(12:13)
I’ve never forgotten those lessons. That’s why my economic plan is all about jobs, dignity, respect, and community. Together we can and will rebuild our economy. And when we do, we’ll not only build back, we’ll build back better, with modern roads, bridges, highways, broadband, ports and airports as a new foundation for economic growth, with pipes of transport, clean water, to every community, with 5 million new manufacturing and technology jobs so the future is made in America. With a healthcare system that lowers premiums, deductibles, drug prices, by building on the Affordable Care Act he’s trying to rip away. With an education system that trains our people for the best jobs of the 21st century. There’s not a single thing american workers can’t do. And where cost doesn’t prevent young people from going to college and student debt doesn’t crush them when they get out. With a childcare and eldercare system that makes it possible for parents to go to work and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity. With an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values.(13:36)
And with newly empowered labor unions. They’re the ones that build the middle class. With equal pay for women, with rising wages you could raise a child on, a family on. And yes, we’re going to do more than praise our essential workers. We’re finally going to pay them. Pay them. We can and we will deal with climate change. It’s not only a crisis, it’s an enormous opportunity, an opportunity for America to lead the world in clean energy and create millions of new, good-paying jobs in the process. And we can pay for these investments by ending loopholes, unnecessary loopholes, and the president’s $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1% and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of which do not pay any tax at all. Because we don’t need a tax code that rewards wealth more than it rewards work. I’m not looking to punish anyone. Far from it. But it’s long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share.(14:51)
And for our seniors, social security is a sacred obligation, a sacred promise made they paid for. The current president is threatening to break that promise. He’s proposing to eliminate a tax that pays for almost half the social security, without any way of making up for that loss revenue, resulting in cuts. I will not let that happen. If I’m your president, we’re going to protect social security and Medicare. You have my word. One of the most powerful voices we hear in the country today is from our young people. They’re speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in America. Economic injustice, racial injustice, environmental injustice. I hear their voices, if you listen, you can hear them too. And whether it’s the existential threat posed by climate change, the daily fear of being gunned down in school, or the inability to get started in your first job, it will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America to everyone. And I’m not going to have to do it alone because I’ll have a great vice president at my side, Senator Kamala Harris.(16:18)
She’s a powerful voice for this nation. Her story is the American story. She knows about all the obstacles thrown in the way of so many in our country, women, Black women, Black Americans, South Asian Americans, immigrants, the left out and the left behind, but she’s overcome every obstacle she’s ever faced. No one’s been tougher on the big banks and the gun lobby. No one has been tougher in calling out the current administration for its extremism, its failure to follow the law, its failure to simply tell the truth. Kamala and I both draw from our families. That’s where we get our strength. For Kamala it’s Doug and their families. For me, it’s Jill and ours. I’ve said many times, no man deserves one great love in his life, let alone two. But I’ve known two. After losing my first wife in that car accident, Jill came into my life. She put our family back together. She’s an educator, a mom, a military mom, and an unstoppable force. If she puts her mind to it, just get out of the way. She’s going to get it done.(17:35)
She was a great second lady and I know she’ll make a great first lady for this nation. She loves this country so much. And I’ll always have the strength that can only come from family. Hunter, Ashley, all our grandchildren, my brothers, my sister, they give me courage, they lift me up. While he’s no longer with us, Beau inspires me every day. Beau served our nation in uniform, a year in Iraq, a decorated Iraqi war veteran. So I take very personally the profound responsibility of serving as commander in chief. I’ll be a president who’ll stand with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries, the days of cozying up to dictators is over. Under President Biden, america will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties on their heads of American soldiers, nor will I put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise, voting. And I’ll always stand for our values of human rights and dignity.(18:56)
I’ll work in common purpose for more secure, peaceful, and prosperous world. History has thrust one more urgent task on us. Will we be the generation that finally wipes out the stain of racism from our national character? I believe we’re up to it. I believe we’re ready. Just a week ago yesterday, was the third anniversary of the events in Charlottesville. Close your eyes, remember what you saw on television. Remember seeing those neo-Nazis, and Klansmen, and white supremacists coming out of fields with lighted torches, veins bulging, spewing the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the thirties. Remember the violent clash that ensued between those spreading hate, and those with the courage to stand against it. Remember what the president said when asked. He said they were “very fine people on both sides.” It was a wake up call for us as a country, and for me, a call to action. At that moment, I knew I’d have to run, because my father taught us that silence was complicity, and I can never remain silent or complicit. At the time, I said we’re in the battle for the soul of this nation, and we are.(20:33)
One of the most important conversations I’ve had this entire campaign. It was so someone who was much too young to vote. I met with six year old Gianna Floyd the day before her daddy, George Lloyd was laid to rest. She’s an incredibly brave little girl and I’ll never forget it. When I leaned down to speak to her, she looked in my eyes and she said, and I quote, “Daddy changed the world.” Daddy changed the world. Her words burrowed deep into my heart. Maybe George Floyd’s murder was a breaking point. Maybe John Lewis’ passing is the inspiration. But however it’s come to be, however it’s happened, America’s ready in John’s words, to lay down, quote, “The heavy burden of hate at last.” And in the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism. American history tells us that it’s been in our darkest moments that we’ve made our greatest progress, that we found the light. In this dark moment, I believe we’re poised to make great progress again, that we can find the light once more.(22:05)
Many people have heard me say this but I’ve always believed you can define America in one word, possibilities. The defining feature of America, everything is possible. That in America, everyone, and I mean, everyone should be given an opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them. We can never lose that. In times as challenging as these, I believe there’s only one way forward, as united America, a united America, united in our pursuit of a more perfect union. United in our dreams of a better future for us and for our children. United in our determination to make the coming years bright. Are you ready? I believe we are. This is a great nation. We’re good and decent people. For Lord’s sake this is the United States of America, and there’s never been anything we’ve been able to accomplish when we’ve done it together.(23:15)
The Irish poet, Seamus Heaney once wrote, “History says, don’t hope on this side of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up and hope and history rhyme.” This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme with passion and purpose. Let us begin you and I together, one nation, under God, united in our love for America, united in our love for each other. For love is more powerful than hate, hope is more powerful than fear, and light is more powerful than dark. This is our moment, this is our mission. May history be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight as love and hope and light join in the battle for the soul of the nation. And this is a battle we will win and we’ll do it together. I promise you. Thank you, and may God bless you, and may God protect our troops."

Thank you, Lily. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. As Lily already indicated, I’m Jill Biden’s husband, Joe Biden. And Lily, thanks for bringing us together and for the energy and leadership you’ve brought this indispensable organization. You’ve heard me say before, Lily, you head up a union and an organization that holds the future of the country in your hands. And what happens to our children is going to determine exactly what happens to this nation. These aren’t someone else’s children, they’re our children. They’re the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft. And you have them in your hands. And your members are lucky to have you. And I’m absolutely certain of that because I happened to be, as I said, married to one of your members. Jill and I are truly honored to have your support. And I mean, that from bottom of my heart.(18:39)
I can’t wait for the departure of Donald Trump and the chance to replace Betsy DeVos and the opportunity for us to make a whole lot of progress together. Because I’m confident, I’m absolutely confident we can. And I want to assure you tonight, this is going to be a teacher oriented department of education, and it’s not going to come from the top down. It’s coming from the teachers up. I know that there are a number of issues on everybody’s mind, but an immediate challenge is the continued spread of the coronavirus and what it means in the upcoming school year.(19:16)
Look, we saw this challenge coming. I’ve calling for the president to address this for months, since late January. Donald Trump failed to take any action on testing, contact tracing, creating responsible standards, everything we needed to do to get the pandemic under control and to get educators and students back in the classroom. And you understood what was needed. Frankly, we’ve always understood. Back in 2009, when I was overseeing the implementation of a recovery act in the face of the worst financial crisis in American history short of the depression, we knew we had to stand up for educators. It was almost a $84 billion program that had to get out there within the matter of 16, I guess, probably 18 months and it had less waste and fraud than any program of that size ever, less than two tenths of 1%.(20:15)
But here’s what it did. It allocated $60 billion to local school districts. $60 billion which saved 400,000 education jobs. We knew it had to be done in the face of the crisis. And the federal government also understood that every state requires to balance their budget. Localities have to balance their budget. There’s a reason why the federal government couldn’t be able to deal with crises like this. But this time around, when the pandemic struck, Trump tried to provide support failed when he said we got to support educators. Trump to failed to do it. Trump and local government, the state and local governments are facing huge shortfalls.(20:59)
Speaker Pelosi, a real leader, and the house of representatives, did their job. They passed a thing called the HEROES Act, $950 billion for state and local governments. Trump and the Senate Republican refused to do the job. This isn’t a math exercise. This is about people. So I’m making sure educators salary don’t get cut and educators don’t get fired. And we could have kept every educator employed, but instead, we lost more than 900, 000 state and local education jobs since the pandemic started due to budget cutting. This is absolutely unacceptable. We’re already short the number of teachers we need nationally, before this crisis hit.(21:45)
Last month, I put out a plan to reopen safely and sustainably, including for our public schools. I require steps like one, ensuring that schools have funding for physical alterations, like plexiglass to maximize social distancing, all of the things that every scientist has told us we need to do. And we need the federal government to give schools and states and local governments clear guidance. Finally, we need to prevent any further exacerbating inequities in our education system by ensuring that every student, every American student has access to broadband and other technology, so they can participate in remote learning.(22:24)
There’s probably a higher probability that we’ll need to continue to rely on more remote learning in parts in the country for a while longer. And we’ve seen, and all of you know, the gap in students’ access to technology can cost kids up to a full year or more of learning. We need to get this done now. We’ve been arguing it for a while. It’s only just a start now. Because once we get ahead of this pandemic, we’re going to have an unprecedented opportunity to make progress and we need to ensure that you and your students get treated with dignity that you deserve. My education plan starts with tripling the funding for a Title I school. One of the first things that districts must do with their funding is ensure hire… in order to get this money they have to ensure higher salaries for educators. That funding will also eliminate the $23 billion annual gap between majority white and non white districts. It’s one of the single best instruments and investments that we can make to address systemic inequality. In addition to getting the raises you deserve, we’re going to get you the resources you need. We’re going to double the number of school psychologists and counselors and nurses and social workers at school. Mental health is an enormous issue and the need has only been exacerbated by this pandemic on both educators as well as students. There’s a whole lot more in my plan.(23:53)
We’re going to fix universal pre-K for all three and [inaudible 00:23:56] years old. We’re going to find it for everybody. Help educators wipe out the burden of their own student debt. But there is a bottom line here. When we win this election, we’re going to get the support you need and the respect you deserve. You don’t just have a partner in the White House, you’ll have an NEA member in the White House. And if I’m not listening, I’m going to be sleeping alone in the Lincoln bedroom. We’re absolutely totally committed to make so much more progress [inaudible 00:08:27]. There’s so much to talk about. I know you have questions. I wish I could talk longer about how passionate I feel about some of these things. But [inaudible 00:24:36] as my mother would say, hush up and I’d be happy to take some of your questions. (24:45)
You betcha. You’re the best. (24:51)
Yeah, you really are. (24:51)
You really are. (27:55)
What I’ve been doing my whole career. That’s how I got involved. Look, this has to be a wake up call for the country and to take action. It’s past time to [inaudible 00:28:03] of racism and our growing economic inequities. We just need to do it. But [inaudible 00:28:09] nations promised with so many people. It starts off, as you know better than I do, because I spent a lot of time working with young people, but I never taught young people. The first thing is to treat them with respect, treat them with dignity, tell them about holding their heads high, reminding them that everybody gets knocked out, but you got to get up, reminding them that they can do anything at all, anything at all, if they set their mind to it. And that you and I and others are fighting for them. I’m going to fight every day for the changes that I’ve referenced. But I’m also going to listen.(28:49)
I laid out the initial [inaudible 00:28:52] leadership I think I need to take on a real police reform, hold all cops to higher standards that so many don’t now. One of the things you find [inaudible 00:29:05] young students you may have in that circumstance, but you find they have a mom or dad unfairly, or maybe even fairly, but incarcerated. And when they get out of school, what happens? When they get out of prison, what happens? They’re treated as if they’re still in prison. We have to revive, we have to treat the criminal justice system like rehabilitation. Not like it is punishment. No one should go to jail, for example, for the use of a drug. They should go to medic or rehab. No more prisons be built. Build rehab facilities. We have to invest in our criminal justice, focus on ending cash bail, converting drug offenders to rehabilitating, investing much more in their reentry.(29:48)
What we need to do more than just reform the police department if it’s going to address the inequities in our society. We have to root out systemic racism in our economy, our education, and our healthcare. And I’m going to fight to end the deadly health inequities that exist in COVID-19 amplified by worry, expanding Obamacare. So they don’t see your parents family that you got I can’t go for a test because we can’t afford it, or I’m really feeling sick, but I’m afraid if I go I’m go it’s going to [inaudible 00:30:17].(30:18)
The fastest path to universal care is to expand Obamacare, which I won’t go into now, but I have a detailed way to do it and get it done. I’m going to double the funding for community health centers. On the violent front lines, make all coronavirus testing and treatment and vaccine for anyone free. And if I could give every child [inaudible 00:00:30:38]. I really want to know, because at all the great university over the last 10 years, we’ve come up with some really startling new insights. You had about 40% of a child’s brain is developed by the time they’re three, up to 60%. Providing universal pre-K for three to four years old increasing over 58%, the chance of them doing well all the way through school. Tripling Title I funding to close that gap between the rich and the poor, making public college free for every family earning less than $125,000 a year.(31:17)
I propose making sure we get $75 billion to HBCUs, which I’ve been deeply involved with my whole career, because they don’t have the kind of backup funding to provide for the laboratories and all the other things that are needed to compete for government contracts. That will do everything for all industry in the future. We’re going to lead a just and national recovery providing stimulus funding for small businesses. You all know better than I do, but I know pretty darn well, that community, particularly a poor community, Latino or black community, thrives or doesn’t thrive whether or not they have amidst around them small businesses. They have the local hardware store, the local drug store, the local supermarket…(32:02)
The local drug store, the local supermarket. But what’s happening now is under this unfair recovery that Trump is running, they’re not doing what they have wanted to do. Provide small business money for those with 10 or fewer businesses, so that they can stay open. They’re not getting the loans. They should be getting them and rebuilding strong, inclusive communities. And that generates growth, that generates self awareness, it generates community.(32:34)
These are big things. But if ever there was a time for big change, it’s now. We have to make this at least an era of action to reverse systemic racism, is long overdue with concrete change but it’s coming. We can do it because once things happen we reach, and I guess I’m sounding like a history professor, or the law professor that I was for a while. And that is that there are inflection points in American history, or something happens and big changes occur.(33:06)
What’s happened now with this COVID virus, and so many people affected by it, and so many people unnecessarily died because of it, all of a sudden people are realizing, oh my God, who’s been carrying us on their back? Essential worker. Who are the essential workers? Overwhelmingly people of color, black, Latino, Asian American. And they’re getting paid five, six, seven bucks an hour. Those are the ones that are making sure that shelf is stocked in the grocery store, and I’m able to come by and pick up my groceries, outside. They’re the ones that are not able to stay home because they have no choice. They be carrying us on their back. I think the public is ready. It’s like they had their blinders taken off like, oh my God, this really happens? It’s really this way.(34:03)
I spent time with the Floyd family at George Floyd’s funeral. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. Mama. Mama. What happened was the whole world saw it. They just didn’t hear it. They saw it. They saw it. They saw his face smashed up against that curb. They saw him hold him there for a total of eight minutes and 46 seconds. They saw it. They said, “Oh my God.” We’re going to change this. We’re going to change it in a big way.(34:49)
Last thing I’ll say. As a kid, I used to stutter a lot. I’m not making it comparable to someone who is a young African American who has not been treated well, or has been a victim of systemic racism. But I tell you one thing don’t do. Don’t ever talk down on these kids. And they tell me, I talk to them, they finish my sentence for me. I’m smart, don’t finish my sentence. These kids are capable of doing anything anybody else can do. Let’s not dumb it down. They’re incredibly capable. That’s fine. With title one funding money, I want to make sure that in those schools, they have these placement courses as well. My mother used to having an expression, children tend to turn out to be what you expect of them. Let’s show them the love and respect, and then the support. You’ve got to give their parents more economic power. [inaudible 00:35:53] a lot more of centrist pride. I’m emotional about it. We can do this. We are at one of those inflection points. Thank you for what you do. (37:12)
Good afternoon.:15)
My name is Paula McConnell. I am from McComb County in the great lake state of Michigan. I have been a para-educator for over 30 years in Utica community schools. In the midst of this pandemic, as educators, have some concerns. We have President Trump disregarding the advice of health experts and pushing for the immediate opening of schools. And then highly unqualified Betsy DeVos either has nothing to say or is giving already scarce public school dollars to private education, which puts the jobs of dedicated educators everywhere at risk. Vice President Biden, I’d like to know what you have to say to educators and parents that are so desperate for leadership on these issues, but find none with the present administration?(38:17)
To paraphrase Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in the great depression. He said the American people can handle bad news, but you have to give it to them straight. That has never been more important than it is now. Americans haven’t been getting it straight from this president. They’ve made tremendous sacrifices over the past few months to buy this government time to get his act together to beat this virus. But Donald Trump squandered that sacrifice and it’s all about him. Think about it. He thinks the presidency is about him, and it doesn’t have a damn thing to do with him. It’s about you. It’s about the American people. First of all, it’d be nice to have a president who’d tell the truth occasionally. We’ll do the work, but who’s going to lead? We need a plan.(39:12)
I’ve outlined the key steps for beating this crisis and reopening safely, including by helping childcare and schools reopen. Parents have to be able to trust their kids are safe when they’re able to go back to work, when that occurs. It’s one of the most important steps to reopening the entire economy. Educators make tremendous sacrifices, some show much creativity. We’ve done the hard work to make the abrupt shift to online learning, with overwhelming difficulty. Demands that students don’t really have the equipment. Not the educators fault because they come from poor families. And because many places don’t have high speed broadband. But the longer schools are closed, the classes are remote, the more students, especially low income students and students of color, fall behind.(39:59)
I’d mobilize the federal government to take this place to step one. Provide for schools to reopen. Make sure states and districts have the funding to keep educators on the job in the midst of this crisis. Boost federal funding to cover the cost of the PPE, extra cleaning, new technologies, redesigned classrooms, all the things schools are going to need to do to be able to open and open with normality. Scale research in how COVID affects children to help understand how the virus affects children and create evidence based guidance. Build a safer school best practice clearing house. Tell school and school board that children and childcare providers all across the country and around the world to share information approaches and tools for reopening.(40:48)
I’m going to work with educators, childcare providers, unions, communities, and families on how to reopen safely. The bottom line is we are not 50 different nations in the United States, and territories beyond that territories. We are one nation, one nation, and we act and it can simply mess with your thought pattern. And the way the president tries to turn this all into some kind of racial contest about me. It’s immoral. We have to have a clear message based on science, based on what the experts tell us. And based on the circumstances that we allow. And make sure we get the input from the people who are in the field, in the classroom, in the buildings, dealing with the problem. But look, even when it gets to the point where we figured out how to test and trace, which doesn’t exist very much in the country. How about a president who says stop the testing, it’s showing too many people have it. Stop the testing? You’re doing too much of it? Sorry, I think he said slow it down.(42:07)
What in God’s, this is not about him and his reelection. This is about the safety and security of our people. And parents, including teachers, are not going to be able to go back to work until they’re sure their children from one oh, to three to four years old are able to be taken care of safely. And so there’s so much forgotten but we can do it. We can do it. The public is ready to pay for it, and it will increase productivity in this country, it will increase the learning, it will increase salaries, and increase the benefits to the whole country. (43:03)
I know it. (43:46)
Hey Jimbo.: (43:48)
My name is Jimbo lamb and I’ve been a high school math teacher in the Annville-Cleona school district in the Southern region of the Pennsylvania education association for 17 years. I appreciate you providing time for me to ask this question, and for listening to educators. Today, we’re more divided than we have been at any time in my lifetime, whether it is about racial justice, wearing masks, or simply left versus right. And educators, we teach our students to be respectful kind, and to work with others, but our leaders fail to model this behavior. So here’s my question. As president, what will you do to hear the voices of all Americans, not just those that support your agenda?(44:28)
Well, Jimbo, you know that I’m a Pennsylvania guy from Scranton, married a Philly girl, and I was just out of Harrisburg actually. Anyway, look, you may remember when I started the campaign over a year ago and I announced. I said, one of the things you have to do is unite the country and I got clobbered by everyone running for president for the Democrats. They said, “You can’t unite the country.” Well, I’ll tell you what, if we don’t unite the country we’re in deep, deep, deep, deep trouble.(45:04)
This is the most important election in our lifetimes. Not because I’m running, because four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of this nation. And the character of our country is literally on the ballot. Lives and livelihoods as well. I think we’re facing a serious threat. We have to meet it as one country. This president gives us no direction. It pits us against one another. We can’t go on like this in the nation. Half recovering, half getting worse, half wearing masks, half denying science, half of a plan, half just hoping for the best. This country’s crying out for leadership, Jimbo. And for healing. I emphasized the healing.(45:47)
That’s part of a president’s job to lead, listen, and heal. And to listen to everyone. Even before today, our politicians have become too mean, too personal, and too early. It weakens us. It distracts us. It divides us. It’s not who we are. And I refuse to accept the idea that our nation is permanently divided. It is not. Principles must never be compromised, compromise is not a dirty word. It’s how our government was designed to work. I found that my whole life. And so I’ll do as president.(46:25)
Look, there’s two reasons why Jim, I decided to run this time. You know, if the perfect president, if he or she requires to have 10 great attributes. I’ve not met one that has more than six. But all the attributes you have may not be appropriate for that moment in history. There’s two things I’ve done fairly well at in my career. One, no one’s ever doubted my word. And I’ve been able to bring Democrats and Republicans together in the United States Congress for past big things, to deal with big issues. There’s a reason for that, Jimbo. I never questioned what was the man or woman’s motives. I questioned their judgment, but not their motives. When I first got elected in 1972, I wasn’t old enough to be sworn in as a senator, I was only 29 years old. So I had to wait. My birthday didn’t come until 17 days after the election. I was in Washington on December 18th, hiring staff. And I did it in December 18th, and I got a phone call. I got a phone call from a first responder who said, and I felt so badly for it in retrospect. He said “You’ve got to come home, there’s been an accident.” What happened? And the poor kid just blurted out, “Your wife’s dead. Your daughter’s dead. And your two boys not may not make it.” My wife, and my daughter was 18 months old. My son, almost three, the other one, almost four, were Christmas shopping. The tree was on top of the car. They were broadsided by a tractor trailer and they were killed. The two-(48:03)
… by a tractor trailer and there were killed, the two boys made it. So what happened was I decided I didn’t want to be a United States senator. And my brother, Jim Bo, every kid would call him Jim Bo. His name is James, Jimmy Biden. Well, Jim Bo was the guy, he’s five and a half years younger than me, but he had raised all our money, raised as the kiddy’s campaign we had.(48:26)
And he went to the Democratic governor-elect to put someone in my place because the state could always get another senator, my kids couldn’t get another dad. And what happened was the group of really fine senators, one Republican, five Democrats, all came to see me and said, “You’ve got to run, and you’ve got to be sworn in.”(48:48)
In retrospect, they saved my sanity. “Just stay for six months. Just stay for six months.” I’ll never forget, Senator Mansfield saying, “Only 1,702 people have ever been sworn into the Senate. Your wife nearly worked so hard to get you elected. You owe it to your family.” So I was supposed to go down to get sworn in, and the day I supposed to be sworn in I decided not to go.(49:12)
Well, the next day I was in the hospital with my son and they sent up the secretary of the Senate that swore me in the hospital. They tell me I’m the only guy sworn in in a hospital with my boys. So I went down, and one of the things I had to do was I had to meet with the majority leader at two o’clock or three, depending on the week on Tuesday afternoon. And I get an assignment from the leader, Mike Mansfield from Montana.(49:41)
I thought all senators got assignments. No senators get assignments. Matter of fact, I’m the first senator I ever knew. I didn’t know anything. It took me about five, six weeks to realize that he just was sort of taking my pulse, just seeing how I was emotionally.(49:58)
So I’d walk in to the Senate floor just before 2:00, walk down into the well of the Senate, seen the last Republican leave, walk out the other door to other side into the leader’s office and had my meeting because I commuted everyday to Wilmington, Delaware. So the next thing that happens is I walk in the door this particular day, the last week in May, and two friends of mine, one became a great friend, and still is, Bob Dole and the other was Teddy Kennedy. He was already a senator.(50:27)
They introduced the precursor to the Americans with Disabilities Act, and a particular senator that got elected [inaudible 00:02:35], who didn’t have much of a heart, I thought, was up on the floor, just saying, “They can’t confiscate my money or anybody else’s to have a curb cut. There’s no requirement that taxpayers should have to pay for lifts on the buses,” and all this stuff.(50:57)
I thought, “What a heartless son of a b.” But I had to walk in and have my meeting. I sat down across the desk from Senator Mansfield, and he always had a corncob pipe, but hardly ever light it. Said, “What’s the matter, Joe.” And I then went off the next few minutes excoriating this senator, saying he had no social redeeming value, he had no heart, et cetera, et cetera.(51:16)
He let me go on, then he stopped. He said, “Joe, what would you say if I told you that senator and his wife were sitting in their home in December, 1970 …” This is now May of ’73. “… 1970, and there was a young man in their statewide newspaper and a picture of him in braces under his arm all the way down to his ankles and two steel crutches?” He was in an orphanage and I think he was 14 years old at the time, and he looked out and he said, “All I want for Christmas is someone to love me and take me home.”(51:49)
He said, “Joe, what would you say if I told you they adopted that young?” I said, “I’d fucking fold.” He said, “Well, they did, Joe.” He said, “I’ve learned something,” he said, ” … over my years, too.” He said, “It’s always appropriate to question other man or woman’s motive.” I mean, excuse me, ” … judgment, but never their motive. You don’t know what it is, and once you question their motive you can never get to an agreement, by saying, ‘You’re in the pocket of or you,’ or, ‘You missed that,’ and then, ‘By the way, let’s have an education bill.’ They’re not going to work with you.”(52:22)
So I’ve been awfully successful getting things done in the past and bringing people together because I don’t question motive. The other area is, I’ve said that next year I’m going to inherit a world in disarray. My whole professional career and academic career has been all foreign policy and national security. And that’s what it’s going to be now. One of the reason I’m running, but that’s why I think you will not find many Republican senators or House members, even the ones I didn’t know, will ever tell you I misrepresented anything to them.(52:54)
I think there’s a lot we can agree on. And with Trump out of the way, I think we can agree on dealing with some of the problems out there, particularly problems in education, infrastructure, healthcare, all those issues that are all being separated now. And that’s why I think we get so much done. Look, we also have a tremendous opportunity to build back, but not just build back, build back better. We can’t afford not to open our doors and our ears and our hearts.(53:26)
President, I’m going to make sure that we leave nobody out, but it’s also on us, each of us, each of us, to do our part to heal the divisions in this country. Let me ask you a question, rhetorically. When’s the last time you thanked somebody? When’s the last time, if you were out in the Harrisburg area, you have a major storm, in your storm sewer outside, there was a guy out there cleaning it out so your basement wouldn’t flood. Did you walk out and say, “Thank you”? Or on your way to go to him or her, say, “Thank you”? When’s the last time we looked at each other and said, “Can I help you?” Uniting this country requires leadership, but it also happens one person at a time. In your community sometimes, and you don’t plan this, reach out to others, try to, as my mom would say, walk a mile in their shoes. Look to building bridges, not to tear them down. We can disagree, but we don’t have to be disagreeable.(54:26)
That’s what I’ll do as president, and it’s how, together, I think we can start to heal this country. But we have to treat, concluding comment, my dad used to always say, this is God [inaudible 00:54:38], my word as a Biden, “Joey, everybody, everybody deserves to be treated with dignity. No exceptions. Everybody deserves to be treated with dignity.” Treat people with dignity and they’ll return it, I think. Thank you. (55:39)
Well, first of all, thanks for considering me, number one. Number two, I’ve been arguing a long time, because I’ve been listening to my wife, by the way, my deceased wife was a teacher as well, that education should be putting more in the hands of educators. You should have more input on what you teach, how you teach it, and when you teach it. You are the ones in the classrooms. You should have more input.(56:09)
And I really mean this. I’m not just trying to be nice. You are, and you need that more. So first of all, this is going to be a much more teacher-centric education system. I grant it, the vast majority of the funding comes out of the state and local communities, but the portion that’s federal you’re going to have a major say on how it’s spent, where it’s spent, and on what it’s spent.(56:34)
Next thing I’d like to say to you all is that one thing that really always bothered me was the way even in quote educated people, when you’re walking in a reception line somewhere and someone says, “And what do you do?” And say, “I teach.” They go, “Oh, okay.” Next person. ” What did you do?” “Well, I own a boutique, and I do … ” “Oh, tell me about your boutique.” Or, “I have a startup company,” or, “I’m sales with such and such.” You are, and I’m not joking about this, you are the most important profession in the United States.(57:22)
You are the ones that give, as the old expression goes, give these kids wings. You give them confidence. You let them believe in themselves. You equip them. And I promise you, you will never find in American history, a president who is more teacher-centric and more supportive of teachers than me, because Jill has a great expression, “Joe, any country that out educates us is going to out-compete us.” It’s time we raised the game and make you the managers. Thank you all for considering me. Lilith, thank you a lot. I appreciate everything you’ve done for me. I really do, and I hope you’ll consider endorsing me. (58:31)
[crosstalk 00:58:32]. (58:52)
Well, if I get to the White House, you’ll be in my house too. Thank you."
biden_speech_equity.txt,"(06:12)
Hello, hello, hello, hello. My name is Joe Biden. I’m trying to get a job with Chris. He is Mr. President. He’s president of the union. Mr. President, I was kidding him. You know, the hardest thing, only thing harder than being president of a union is being the mayor of a beautiful city.(06:34)
Folks, thanks for taking the time to be here today. I really appreciate it. And we even have an astronaut in our house and I tell you what, that’s pretty cool. Look, first of all, I want to thank Chris and the mayor for being here, and all of you for being here. You know, these are tough times. Over 200,000 Americans have passed away. Over 200,000, and the number is still rising. The impact on communities is bad across the board, but particularly bad for African-American communities. Almost four times as likely, three times as likely to catch the disease, COVID, and when it’s caught, twice as likely to die as white Americans. It’s sort of emblematic of the inequality that exists and the circumstances that exist.(07:33)
One of the things that really matters to me, is we could do … It didn’t have to be this bad. You have 30 million people on unemployment, you have 20 million people figuring whether or not they can pay their mortgage payment this month, and what they’re going to be able to do or not do as the consequence of that, and you’ve got millions of people who are worried that they’re going to be thrown out in the street because they can’t pay their rent. Although they’ve been given a reprieve for three months, but they have to pay double the next three months when it comes around.(08:05)
How people going to do that? And the way, in fact, the Democratic House and the Senate passed, stepped up and passed a significant amount of money to help people get through the process, including keeping businesses open and the like. Well, guess what? They insisted there being a thing called an inspector general, somebody watching where every dollar went. The first thing the president of the United States did is fire that inspector general. There is no inspector. He’s fired. Fired. And so you got 40% of, only 40% of the money intended for small businesses going to small businesses. Only 40% of it. 60% has gone to the Mar-a-Lago crowd.(08:43)
In addition to that, we find ourselves in a circumstance where the idea that we’re going to continue to provide for unemployment insurance for people is very much in doubt, although the House just passed a package today. My generic point is, that the University of Columbia pointed out, that if in fact the president had acted, even though we know now he knew exactly how bad the pandemic was back in February, he’s on tape with Bob Woodward saying he knew how bad it was, and he didn’t say a thing. He didn’t say a thing.(09:17)
If he had spoken, as I said, they said at Columbia, one week earlier, 37,000 more people be alive today. We’re going to have another influx of cases, just between now and January, it’s expected that we’re going to have somewhere between, depending on which estimate you take, between 138 and 178,000 more deaths. And if people just do what we’re doing here, and when you’re at a social distance, as I am, you can take a mask off, but wear a mask. They estimate that would save about close to 89, 90,000 people. And so it’s about being responsible. It’s about being responsible. And we’re not being very responsible.(09:58)
But what I want to talk to you about today is that we have to break a cycle. The cycle that exist is that the African-American community by and large finds itself at the bottom of the economic heap, businesses and others, when things are good. When things get bad, they’re the first ones in the hole. And when things get better, they’re the last ones out. In addition to that, we have a criminal justice system that needs significant repair. And we’re just only beginning, slightly, to make some progress now.(10:28)
And thirdly, if you’re a business person, let me put it this way. Every person out there wants an opportunity to make it for their family. My dad used to have an expression, “Everybody’s entitled to be treated with dignity.” And then he said, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to hold your head up. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, everything’s going to be okay.'”(10:54)
For too many people, particularly in the African-American community, they can’t say that. That’s not able to be done. So one of the things that I want to talk with you about today, is how do we build wealth? Because ultimately, ultimately the African-American community only is going to have its place equal to everyone else when they’re in a position to be able to build wealth, be able to build wealth. And that goes for everything from access to being able to purchase a home, access to jobs, access to just being able to have an even shot. And that’s what I hope we’re going to talk a little about today.(11:25)
It goes to education, as well as access to education, access beyond. Everything from a lot of poor whites and African-Americans, poor African-Americans and Hispanic live in Title I districts, meaning that they live in school districts that have very low tax base. And right now we spent $15 billion a year to compensate for that low tax base. I increased that to $45 billion. What it does, it keeps teachers in schools because we’re short teachers significantly. 125,000 teachers short right now. Be over half a million by 2023. In addition to that, we find ourselves in a circumstance where we used to have in our schools, in the old days, used to have one … Right now we don’t have any, we virtually have no school psychologists in our schools. And so teachers come in to school and they’re expected to solve every problem. Well, there’s one school psychologist for every 1,507 kids in school. It should be closer to one to 500. We can do that by increasing the money I just talked about from 15 to 45. And send every single child that’s three years old, four years old, and five years old, not to daycare, but to school. All the studies of the great universities in this state and every other have pointed out in the last eight years, that’ll increase by 58% their chances of going all the way through school, no matter what the ZIP code they come from, no matter where they are, and be able to do it without getting themselves in trouble.(12:49)
And then we’re going to talk about, I think a big issue here is access to apprenticeships and access to community colleges and college, and the student debt requirements that are there. Hope we can talk about that. But I want to talk about basically one-(13:03)
Hope we can talk about that, but I want to talk about basically one big important thing. How do we change the dynamic? This is a gigantic opportunity. As bad as things have gotten, the blinders have sort of been taken off the American people now. They look out there, and we have the pandemic, unemployment. We have race relations that are just been drawn into focus and everything from police brutality to lack of access. But the American people have all of a sudden, average people have gone, “My Lord. Holy mackerel. I didn’t know it was this bad.” A lot of them didn’t know. A lot did. But a lot didn’t know it was this bad. And talking to … Well, I won’t go into it. I’m talking too much now in my opening statement, but here’s the point.(13:47)
The point is, I believe we have a gigantic opportunity, a gigantic opportunity to fundamentally change the systemic racism and the systemic problems that exist in our system. And I think we have to do it, but only one way to do it. We’ve got to show up and vote. But I believe the American people are not going to be turned off. I believe no matter what the administration does to try to make it hard to vote for everyone, not just people of color, but everyone, no matter what, I think they’re going to vote. You see what’s happened in Virginia, early voting. They have four hour lines in the first day, and we’re over 40 days out. People are going to show up and vote. They will not be dissuaded.(14:25)
And so that’s why I’m optimistic. I was asked by one of the foreign leaders when I was overseas, when I was the vice president, they said, “Can you define America for me?” I said, “Yes, I can, in one word. Possibilities. Possibilities.” We’re the only country that believes anything’s possible. But it’s about time we make it possible for everybody? That’s what this is all about. I think we got a gigantic opportunity in the year 2020 to make these changes. And with that, as my mother would say, I’m going to hush up and take any questions you all have. And I’ve got to get out of the way here. (15:32)
I was kidding Chris inside. I was saying as long as I can say what the best HBCU is in America, Delaware State University. But that’s another issue. That’s a joke, but it’s not a joke. They’re great. That’s how I got my start, by the way. I went to University of Delaware. But the reason I got involved in politics in the first place is because of what was going on in my state in terms of segregation and in terms of Dr. King being assassinated. Part of the, major part of our city was burned to the ground. That’s how I got engaged. And a lot of my support came out of that HBCU.(16:05)
Look, right now, one thing all the data shows is that, given an opportunity, an equal opportunity, there’s not a single thing that an African-American can’t do that a white American can do, that a Hispanic American, an Asian American … I mean, not a single thing. And so what’s happened? It’s about access to opportunity and access to good jobs. Now, an awful lot of universities like, great university like UNC or Wake Forest, a lot of schools, they have endowments, and the endowment allows them to provide for the circumstance to bid for these major federal initiatives that allow them to bring into the school a technology or a program that is able to bring in outside sponsors, as well as government sponsors, and then have students work in those areas.(16:59)
For example, cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is a big deal, but you have to … And as a future, there’s going to be millions of, over time, good paying jobs in the area of cybersecurity. But because the HBCUs, for example, most of them don’t have the economic … They don’t have the endowment to be able to build the facilities that can attract the environment, the government funding, as well as private endowment. They don’t get to set these up.(17:28)
For example, when I was vice president, we went down to Roanoke and we provided funding for an HBCU to have a cybersecurity proposal. They did it. They got the contract. And now what they’re doing are training young women and men who’ll get out and good starting jobs, jobs where you can end up being paid more than a hundred grand a year. And they’re fully, totally, thoroughly capable.(17:48)
What I’ve done is I’ve proposed, and we’ll get this done … I proposed a 10-year program for $70 billion for HBCUs, $70 billion. And that $70 billion will be available through the HBCUs based on their competition to get access to it, but everyone will qualify, every HBCU. And they’ll be able to do the kinds of things that other universities do.(18:13)
For example, Delaware State University is a great university. The president of the university is a young man who used to work for me in my Senate office. Now, brilliant guy. He’s a doctorate. The end result of it is though when the University of Delaware makes an application for dealing with solar energy, because it has a significant base, it gets this significant injection of technological capability, or, for example, light metals. They took over an old facility, it used to be a Ford facility long, long time ago. They took over a facility used to be a Chrysler facility and got shut down. And now what do they have at that facility? They have people in that facility who are now doing metallurgy that relate to making lightweight aluminum and metal decks for aircraft carriers. Well, it’s a multi-million dollar and will end up being a billion-dollar project. And so the people who get to work on that, the very students in that university get to work on it, they’re the ones that are going to go out and get these great jobs. So that’s the first thing I’m going to do for HBCUs.(19:20)
Secondly, we have to look at, and we have been looking at, the idea that we have to bring in HBCUs to engage in more of what we are doing in terms of our national dialogue. And for example, I kid … Two of the guys that are on my co-sponsors of my campaign, African-Americans, they’ve talked about themselves as Morgan men. I’m a Morgan man. Well, there’s a lot of great universities including right here, but we have an opportunity to provide for, you’re able to get to those universities. How can you do it? Well, I’m going to see to it that any family, anyone who comes from a family that makes a total income of less than $125,000 a year gets free college education. They don’t get in. If they get in and qualify, they pay nothing to go to college.(20:18)
Secondly, there are also programs that exist now that if you provide for the work, that you will volunteer to do something in the public interest, and you do it for five years or more, you can deduct $10, 000 a year up to $50,000 off of that debt you have. And you have an awful lot of young African-Americans that have graduated. The average debt is about $19,000 a year. Well, it’s hard as hell to get started. Hard to get started when you have that debt hanging over your head. The average debt is even higher. It’s up to $28,000 a year, someone graduating from a four year school.(20:52)
And that’s why the economists had predicted prior to, and I’ll end with this, I’m telling you too much, but because I’m pretty passionate about this. What happens is that if, it was pointed out before the COVID crisis, that we’re going to have an economic slowdown because the entire generation, this from 9/11 generation through to the generation now, and coming out of this, this god-awful circumstance we’re in, they, in fact, are not going to have the wherewithal because of student debt to be able to borrow the money to buy a home, buy a new vehicle, buy an apartment, and spend the money and capital, where a significant portion of our economy is driven by consumption, by consumption.(21:38)
And this generation, this whole new generation from 9/11 on, that in fact is, they’re not in a position to be able to do it. So there’s a whole lot of reasons that economically this will benefit. This isn’t just draining money. And by the way, I pay for every one of these things by the way, I deal with the tax structure. But that’s another story. So that’s a piece of what I think we can and should be doing with HBCUs. And secondly, I will, in my administration, elevate, elevate the standing of HBCUs by the people in my administration as well. (22:34)
There’s a microphone right there. (22:44)
We’re going to raise it to $15 an hour nationally. I’ve been deeply involved in raising it as I’ve gone around the country working with cities and counties that in fact have raised it, including New York City and out on the West Coast, as well. Here’s the deal. If you make less than $15 an hour working 40 hours a week, you’re making a wage under the poverty level. No one in America should be working for a 40-hour week job and still be living in poverty. It should not exist. Number one.(23:19)
Number two, it also demonstrates that if we pay people $15 an hour as a minimum wage, you grow the economy. The idea that this somehow puts people out of business, there’s no evidence of that. What happens is you have people, if you’re making 15 bucks an hour instead of $7 an hour, you’re able to buy more things. You’re able to pay more bills. You’re able to do more that ends up increasing the GDP, the growth of the whole economy. So it’s not only a good thing for the person who is going to be making a decent wage from the beginning, but going to be good for the economy as a whole. (24:06)
My mother would say, “God love you, dear.” (24:21)
Well, as a simple proposition for me, I don’t exaggerate as a second grade teacher, why you’re so important. If I had only $1 to spend in education and I could spend it post-graduation or pre-kindergarten, I’d spend it pre-kindergarten. Not a joke. Because you know as well as I do based on your educational background, that 60% of a child’s brain is already developed by the time they’re three, four, five years old. (24:49)
And so what happens is, people start off based on their ZIP code and their family background. They may start off way behind the curve. You know you have a lot of students who they come into school, if they come from a very poor background in a community raised by a single mom or a single dad, through no fault of their own, they will have probably heard 1 million fewer words spoken by the time they get to first grade. That by itself is an impediment. Nobody’s forced that on anybody, but we’ve got to change it. And so the way to change it is threefold.(25:22)
Number one, as I said, provide for early education, starting at three years of age, and it’s not … This is you think, “Oh my Lord, why we have a three-year-old go to school?” They learn as rapidly as a six-year-old, a 12-year-old, a 14-year-old. And they just suck it all up. They just suck it all up. Number one. Number two, to make sure that we pay teachers enough money to stay in the business of teaching. My wife’s a full-time teacher. My wife has never stopped. As first lady, as the second lady, I should say, she taught 15 credits every semester at a community college. Before that, she taught juniors and-(26:03)
At a community college. Before that, she taught juniors and seniors in high school for 25 years. I think it was 25. My point is a long time. Although, I’m not allowed to tell the exact number because my wife is 30 years younger than I am. I started off not quite that much. There’s no woman in the entire Biden family as old as any man, but that’s another issue. All kidding aside, the fact is that it is the lifeblood of… Look, people… They say, “Well, these two children.” They’re all our children. They are the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft. (26:36)
It’s bizarre, crazy for us. In every single empirical study done, the more money you spend, the better you educate a child throughout the process, the better the community as a whole is. (26:50)
Everybody, across the board. That’s why we also have to make sure that we provide for more direct funding for specific programs in schools. As you know, better than most will know, the bulk of all the funding, if your school uses local funding- (27:10)
Local funding. (27:11)
It’s not national funding. It’s not federal funding. Federal funding can focus on particular needs within schools. One of those needs is to deal with access to equal education in the early grades and not be determined by your zip code. That requires us to spend more money on schools that in fact, and teachers… Look, I’m not going to ask you what you make. Teachers… One of the other things that all the studies have shown is that when you’re in a student body where there’s students of color, it makes a gigantic difference if there are teachers of color, particularly male teachers of color. (27:51)
A gigantic difference. It’s just a factual predicate. We have to encourage schools of education to attract more people of color to get in and teach. The only way to do that is to raise the salaries. (28:07)
Raise the salaries. (28:09)
I mean, idea that a teacher is out there after several years making $40,000… You have, probably, a student debt larger than that. Enough, for real. That’s why the last piece of the student debt… Anybody who has a student debt who teaches, that counts as working for the national interest. You get to deduct $ 10,000 of that student debt per year for five years, and up to $50,000 if you’re teaching. (28:39)
We can afford this, by the way. This is not something that we have… Just give you a little idea here. I carry this card with me because everybody says, “Well, Biden’s going to raise all taxes, and everybody’s going to be in trouble, and what we’re going to do here.” Let’s see if I can find it, if I have it here. Anyway, I have a list of how I will fund every single thing that I’m talking about. For example, if we just made corporations not pay 21%, and 91 of the Fortune 500 companies pay no tax, zero, zero, okay, none… If we just made them pay 28, it used to be 38, make 28%, raise it to 28%, and everybody had to pay it, that would raise a total of $ 1,370 billion. I’m not trying to punish anybody. It’s time for everybody to start paying their fair share. (29:40)
President has a new proposal. Some of you may like it. I don’t know anybody in my neighborhood know it works very well, and that is another $30 billion tax cut for billionaires. You think I’m making it like billionaire. I sound like Bernie Sanders, “Billionaires are bad.” That’s not the problem. Problem is in reducing the capital gains tax… If you make your money off investments as opposed to sweating your brow or walking up and getting a paycheck, right, he thinks you should only have to pay 15% of your income. You’ll pay more as a school teacher than somebody making $20 million bucks. It’s all coming from investments. It’s not right. Don’t want to punish anybody. Just about time everybody pays their fair share. The way I do that is I raise the tax back for millionaires and billionaires to 39.4%. They’re talking about 90%. That’s not true. It was 39.4% when Bush was president. You just raise that tax rate back up to 39.4%. That raises 6%. That raises $90 billion. Just give you an example.(30:47)
There’s much more I could talk, but my point is it will not… By the way, I went to undergraduate and graduate school. I was very flattered that, I think it’s 14 Nobel Laureates in economics, just endorsed me, and said my plans make sense. All this stuff about Biden’s going to bankrupt the country and Biden is going to spend $400 billion, and you’re going to raise your taxes… not true. We can do it all by just somebody just starting to pay your fair share. That’s all. That’s all. Give people who need a break, a break. (31:23)
Thank you. (31:32)
Maybe three. I know I’m in trouble. (31:34)
I know I’m late, but I apologize. (32:30)
Yes. There was a big plan to do it. There’s a modal plan. First of all, the Cares Act, which passed out of the House and Senate, which was a total of $2 trillion overall, twice, was supposed to provide what they called the Main Street Lending Program. For four months, it didn’t lend a penny. None of the money went out, number one, because you got 20 Republicans in the Senate who said they don’t want to depend anything on anything, for real. The president who has, as I said, fired the Inspector General, so you don’t know where the money’s going for certain. Secondly, on the early program for small businesses… The small business is defined of fewer than 50 employees. Now, most small businesses that are neighborhood small businesses are 10 or fewer employees.(33:23)
What I propose is we focus on making sure that the money goes directly to those businesses that in fact provide for being able to keep their employees on the payroll for the 10 or fewer employees. That’s a priority, and then 50 and under. Here’s what’s happened. What’s happened is that not only has that not occurred, a lot of the money has gone to very big businesses that didn’t need the… I mean, they may need it, but they didn’t need it to stay alive. Even when they got it, what did they do?(33:57)
The commitment that I proposed, and we thought we had done, is that right now, if you get a government bailout, quote, unquote, “loan to stay alive,” what you cannot do is take that money and either buy back your own stock and, or increase your salaries with that money. It’s to keep people employed, keep them on a payroll. That’s what a lot of the businesses have done. They buy back their own stock, increasing the net worth of the people who own the stock, and in fact, pay their salaries based on stock then. They should not be allowed to do that, number one, with government money, bailing people out.(34:41)
Secondly, a lot of you don’t know the circumstance. Now there’s no national standards as to how to open. How do you open safely? President says, “Just put up a sign, Come on in.” Well, you know your employee. Beyond your employees, your customers are going to go, “I don’t know. I mean, does everybody have to have the mask? Do they have dividers in the restaurant? Tell me how the sanitary conditions are working.” Well, you need money to pay for all that stuff. That’s why we proposed to have a multi-billion dollar program where businesses are able to get the money, not borrow the money, get the money to be able to open in the middle of this pandemic, including fixing the testing fiasco.(35:21)
You should be in a situation where your employees can, in 24 hours, get a test to determine whether or not they’re positive or negative. You need to do that for your own protection, and the public likes to know that is protection that there are protection against anything that happens within your restaurant. The bottom line is the money is already there. The president is just not releasing it. Department is not releasing the money. It’s all done in order to be able to keep the economy moving.(35:55)
Right now, we have over 30 million people on unemployment, over 30 million in unemployment. How in God’s name are we going to generate economic growth unless we can figure out how to keep these people back and help you get back in business? It’s the same way with schools. How many schools are not opening because there are no national standards set? No national standards set. For example, there’s a outfit… Am I telling you too much? You want me to stop? (36:21)
Okay. I’m really good at this. This drives me crazy. Right now, we’re in a situation where if you take a look, there is no national standard for how to open schools, how to open them safely, because the president says, “I have no responsibility. That’s not my response.” I mean, literally, that’s his phrase. “It’s not my responsibility. I’m not the blame for any of this. Let the governors or the mayors take care of it,” and then without the financial help that’s needed to be able to take care of it. I’ve laid out in detail back in July, what we’d have to do to open safely and includes providing the protective PPE, the mask, and other things that are needed, gloves, et cetera, for the schools, the school teachers, and for the children coming to school.(37:19)
Secondly, you have to reduce the number of students in one room. You have to have modules that are smaller. For that, you need more teachers, not fewer teachers. You got to pay more teachers. Number three, you’ve got to be able to sanitize the schools, whether it’s everything from the water fountain to the lavatory, or just the surfaces that are touched, and what is breathed on by people. That costs a lot of money to do that, like it would for a restaurant as well for you to have to do that.(37:49)
The money is there, available, to do that, but the president refuses. What he says is just open up and make sure that… School should just open up. It also relates to how far down you’ve got the reinfection rate. If it’s down below one, then it’s rational. You can, with those protections, go ahead and open a school, but watch it very closely. It requires testing and tracing to make sure you’re still on course there.(38:18)
Look, the other thing is that if you think about it, the FEMA, the Federal Emergency… They had agreed that they were going to provide masks for schools. They started to hand them out to schools. Well, guess what? The president didn’t like that, or somebody didn’t like that. The ruling was made, “Opening schools safely is not a national emergency,” so they stopped it. Refusing to even provide masks for schools because it’s not a national emergency. Well, if this isn’t a national emergency, I don’t know what the hell is. The way we’re doing this is the way… I’ll end with this.(39:01)
… way and I’ll end with this. The president was in Ohio, I guess a couple of days ago at a rally. I don’t want to misquote him. And he said at the rally and I wrote this down, he said that “We virtually turned the corner. Nobody is really dying.” He said, “Yeah, elderly people are dying and they’re dying because they have heart conditions or other, but quote unquote, “virtually, they’re virtually nobodies. They’re the only ones dying.”(39:47)
So you go home and your mom is gone, your dad’s gone. He’s a virtual nobody? The idea, the way we’re talking about people, and this is all within our power to do something. The virus wasn’t his fault, but the way he’s handled it has been close to criminal. And so many people breaking their necks and by the way, my deceased wife, when I first got married, I married a beautiful woman from Syracuse, New York, Skaneateles, New York. And I got elected and I was 29-years-old. I come from a very modest family. Not bragging about it, but I was listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years. Because I didn’t think you were supposed to earn any money while you’re there other than your salary.(40:32)
And then when I got elected vice president, one of the press outlets said, “It’s probable no man has ever been assuming the office of vice president with fewer assets than Joe Biden.” I hope they weren’t talking intellectual assets. When I got elected when I was 29, I was in Washington before I was sworn in and I got a phone call from my fire department saying my wife and daughter have just been killed. And my two boys were not likely to make it. A tractor trailer broadsided them while they were Christmas shopping. And at the time, my wife’s father, my father-in-law, he came home from World War II and he had owned a restaurant. He was a cook in World War II in the Navy and he ended up opening up a restaurant in a place called Auburn, New York, a town about 20,000 people, just south of Syracuse.(41:23)
And it became the meeting place for everybody. It’s a place that doctors would start off the morning getting their coffee and the lawyers would have their lunch and kids after graduations would come to this called the Hunter Dinerant and then he opened up other restaurants. And in order to try to convince me to stay, I don’t blame him. I do the same with my daughter. Try to convince after he graduated to take a job in Upstate New York, rather than go back to Delaware. He offered me his prize diner. And he was making at that time, I would have made five times what I made as a lawyer. A starting lawyer salary is six grand and it was 30,000 bucks a year.(42:04)
But the problem was for three years, I had five years I watched how hard he worked. I don’t know how you do it. You got to love it. Even in good times they think you’re crazy. It’s 24 hours a day, but you deserve a break and your employees deserve a break. And the fact that you’re fighting so hard to keep them on a job is a testament to the kind of people you are. But I promise you, I guarantee you if I’m elected, you’ll get both the PPE. You’ll get also the money to be able to open and the additional money, not only to maintain your employees, but to maintain an open place that you in fact can.(42:39)
I’ve met with a lot of restaurateurs up and around the country so they can open up and do everything from having plastic shields in front of the cashiers, to a lot of things you can do to make it safe, make it safe, and you’ll get the help.(42:55)
Thank you so much.(42:56)
Thank you. I can really do yes or no if you ask me the easy questions. (43:01)
[inaudible 00:43:01] whatever you want to ask. (43:10)
I used to be a city council when I ran for the Senate because it was too hard. They know where you live.aham: (43:16)
Exactly. First, I want to thank you. You honored me and my family by sending a video tribute for my sister, Cynthia Graham Hurd-(43:25)
Oh my Lord, I apologize. I didn’t know. I’m sorry.aham: (43:29)
No, no, no, no, no. As you know, killed at the Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston. And so my question is how do you reimagine the Justice Department and specifically the Civil Rights Division after four years of Trump?(43:43)
Well, first of all, and I guess I’ll just say it. This has been the most corrupt administration in modern American history. The Justice Department has turned into the president’s private law firm. He actually has them representing him on women who accused him of rape. Where does that come from? And the Justice Department under my administration will be totally independent of me.(44:14)
I will not direct them who to prosecute, how to prosecute, what to prosecute. And I will not be injecting. I will not enter their decisions based upon the judgments they make about what cases they bring and they don’t bring. With regard to the Civil Rights Division, I would significantly increase two things. One, civil rights presence in the Justice Department elevated so it has access to and transparency to all police departments’ activities across the country. Just so they are aware that it’s transparent what’s going on.(44:50)
I would also make sure that I elevate the Justice Department, excuse me, the Civil Rights Division to have a direct office with inside the White House. When, for example, I’m the guy that wrote the Violence Against Women Act. When the president asked me what I wanted as vice president, I said, “I want to have jurisdiction over that act inside the White House.” Because it elevates the standing of whatever that office that comes inside the White House.(45:18)
So I would make sure there’s a combination of the Civil Rights Division having more direct authority inside the Justice Department and being able to investigate than in fact it has now. But most of all, most of all, I would have an attorney general who understood his oath of office. It’s not a joke. The attorney general has the oath of office that in fact could do and move on what the professionals in the department thought had to be pursued without my interfering to say, “No, they’re my friends” or “I know them” or “Go after this person. Go after Hillary.” You know what I mean? This kind of stuff.(45:58)
I get asked the question all the time by the press that travels with me, although I’m not sure the same ones that are traveling today have asked it, but I get asked the following question. “If in fact you get elected, would you prosecute Trump? Would you pursue prosecuting Trump?” And the answer is I’m not going to pursue prosecuting anybody. I’m going to do what the Justice Department says should be done, should be done and not politicize it. It’s the most dangerous thing that’s happened so far is the politicization of the Department of Justice. It’s become the Department of Trump and that’s wrong. (47:01)
Who’s the fellow who runs 26 organizations for housing? Public? I know we didn’t get a chance to talk. Because I think what you’re doing is incredibly consequential. And I like to give you a paper on the way out of what I think we can and should do. It’s very detailed and I’d love your feedback. I’ll put a phone number on it, okay? Because it is a gigantic, gigantic, gigantic undertaking. And unless we can get people into housing, unless we can provide for housing, unless we can stop the gentrification where people are left out, then we’re going to be in real trouble.(47:42)
And what you’re doing is really … I’m not trying to boost him. I’ve never met the gentleman, but I did read your bio and what you’re working on. And I’d really like your input and may able to call you if I could after you get what I’m proposing in detail and see what we can work out. And part of the reason I do this and what I miss about being able to do larger engagements is this is where I learn. I’m a tactical guy. I mean, I’d rather be shaking your hand and looking you in the eye and you telling me what needs to be done.(48:18)
And don’t be reluctant at all to criticized my plan if you think it doesn’t make sense. I think it’s pretty good. I’ve worked on it really, really hard. It goes from Section 8 housing all the way to first-time home buyers, to the whole notion of these… Anyway, I’m going to give it to you before I leave, okay? You’re very polite to sit here all this time. Thank you. Thank you everybody. I really appreciate it. (48:53)
Don’t Jump."

Please welcome Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris.(17:27)
Hello hello. Thanks for being here. I wish we were able to talk to the folks outside but we’re keeping our social distancing and playing by the rules. Good afternoon everyone. To me and to Kamala, this is an exciting day. It’s a great day for our campaign and it’s a great day for America in my view. Over the past several weeks I have had the incredible privilege of meeting and spending a good deal of time with a group of talented women leaders, all of whom are qualified to be president. With each one, the more I learned about them, the more I talked to them, the more impressed I was even though I knew them before. I want to thank each and every one of them for being part of this process and I look forward to working with them as we rebuild this country to get elected and once we are elected God willing.(18:27)
I approached this with a seriousness of purpose and of mind because this is a serious moment for our nation. We’re at one of those inflection points, you’ve heard me say that before, in our history. A life-changing election for this nation and the choice, the choice we make this November is going to decide the future of America for a very, very long time and I had a great choice. Great opportunities. I had a great choice but I have no doubt that I picked the right person to join me as the next Vice President of the United States of America and that’s Senator Kamala Harris. You know, it seems Americans all across this nation, at least at the outset here agree with me. Yesterday we had our best grassroots fundraising day of the campaign, more than double our previous record, and in doing so, we set a single day record for online political fundraising and I think I know why. So I hope that you’ll join us as well, those of you listening today. Go to joebiden.com today, $5.00, $10.00, whatever.(19:45)
Kamala, as you all know is smart, she’s tough, she’s experienced, she’s a proven fighter for the backbone of this country, the middle class, for all those who are struggling to get into the middle class. Kamala knows how to govern. She knows how to make the hard calls. She’s ready to do this job on Day One and we’re both ready to get to work, rebuilding this nation and building it better. As attorney general of the largest state in the country, Kamala took on the big banks over mortgage fraud and won. Took on big oil that wanted to pollute without consequences. She was a pioneer in marriage equality and tackled the gun lobby. You know, we’ve all watched her in the United States Senate go toe to toe with Trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that needed to be asked and not stopping until she got an answer and when none was forthcoming it was obvious what the answer was.(20:51)
As a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee, she’s been the center, in the middle of the most critical national security challenges our country faces. Well aware, well aware of all the threats to this nation and ready to respond to them. As a child of immigrants, she knows personally how immigrant families enrich our country as well as the challenges of what it means to grow up black and Indian-American in the United States of America. Her story is America’s story, different from mine in many particulars, but also not so different in the essentials. She has worked hard, she has never backed down from a challenge, and she has earned each and every of the accolades and achievements that she has gained. Many of them often in the face of obstacles that others put in her way but never quit, and this morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up, especially little black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities, but today, today just maybe, they’re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way, as the stuff of presidents and vice presidents.(22:20)
In her campaign in the primary, Kamala often talked about what she referred to as the 3:00 a.m. agenda, about moms and dads awake late at night in their kitchens, worried, scared, uncertain about how they were going to take care of their families, about how they were going to pay the bills, about how they were going to make it, simply make it. Growing up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, I saw that struggle with my family as well. Kamala saw it with hers as well and millions of Americans are living that struggle as we speak, especially in this moment of crisis, especially with so many jobs lost. Kamala and I both know that all folks are looking for as my dad would say is an even shot, just give me a shot, a fair shot, a shot at making it and it will be the work of our administration to make sure they get a fair shot.(23:24)
Working families need someone on their side in this nation because they certainly don’t have anyone in the president now on their side. That’s going to change in a Biden-Harris administration. It’s going to be gratifying to see the strong, enthusiastic reaction to Senator Harris as our next vice president. It comes from people all over the country, it’s already occurring. All over the country, all ideological views, all backgrounds. Events of course, we are predictable, some of them. It comes from all over except of course from Donald Trump’s White House and his allies. You all knew it was coming. You could have set your watches to it. Donald Trump has already started his attacks, calling Kamala “nasty”, whining about how she is “mean” to his appointees. It’s no surprise because whining is what Donald Trump does best, better than any president in American history.(24:37)
Is anyone surprised Donald Trump has a problem with a strong woman or strong women across the board? We know that more is to come, so let’s be clear. If you’re a working person, worried about whether or not you have a job to go to, whether or not you’ll be able to pay your mortgage, pay your rent, worried about the poison in the air you breathe, the water you drink, worried about your civil rights, even your basic right to dignity which is under attack with this administration, Kamala Harris has had your back and now we have to have her back. She’s going to stand with me in this campaign and all of us are going to stand up for her. On January 20, 2021, we’re all going to watch Senator Harris raise her right hand and swear the oath of office as the first woman ever to serve in the second highest office in America in this land, and then we’re going to get to work, fixing the mess that President Trump and Vice President Pence have created, both at home and abroad through four years of mismanagement and coddling of terrorists and thugs around the world. Not only will America dig itself out of this hole they put us in, we’re going to build. We’re going to build back and we’re going to build back better. We have a public health crisis. While he’s in court trying to do away with health care, with more than five million reported infections, 165,000 people dead and climbing as a consequence of COVID-19 and still, months later, no real leadership or plan from the President of the United States how to get this pandemic under control. No real help for the states and local governments trying to fill the vacuum of leadership from the White House. No real help for children and educators, for small businesses and frontline workers, they’re the ones that are holding our country together. Instead, he’s issuing executive orders and making promises that in the end will defund the Social Security system while insisting that this virus will disappear.(27:12)
The Joe Biden and Kamala Harris administration will have a comprehensive plan to meet the challenge of COVID-19 and turn the corner on this pandemic. Masking, clear science-based guidance, dramatically scaling up testing, getting states and local governments the resources they need to open the schools and businesses safely. We can do this. We just need a president and vice president willing to lead and take responsibility. Not as this president says, “It’s not my fault. The governor should thank me more.” As that old saying goes, give me a break. We have an economic crisis and more than 16 million Americans, 16 million, still out of work. Donald Trump is on track to break another record. On track to leave office with the worst jobs records of any American president in modern history, but instead of doing the hard work, of meeting face to face with congressional leaders, Democrats and Republicans in the White House like every other president has done in a crisis, to get Americans the relief they need and deserve, Donald Trump is on the golf course. If I told you this three years ago you’d look at me like I was being crazy. He hasn’t even met with the leadership. He doesn’t have time it appears.(28:58)
We have a climate crisis that Donald Trump refuses to even acknowledge. When he thinks about climate change, all we hear is the word hoax. A Biden-Harris administration is going to meet the climate crisis, protect the health of the American public. Along the way, we’re going to deliver one word, jobs. Good paying jobs. We have a racial justice crisis. Donald Trump seeks only to inflame it with his politics of racist rhetoric and appeals to division. Today’s not only the day I’m proud to introduce Senator Kamala Harris as the vice presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. It’s also the third anniversary of that terrible day in Charlottesville. Remember? Remember what it felt like to see those neo-Nazis, close your eyes, and those Klansmen, white supremacists, coming(30:03)
… close your eyes, and those Klansmen, white supremacists, coming out of fields, carrying lighted torches, faces contorted, bulging veins, pouring into the streets of a historic American city, spewing the same antisemitic bile we heard in Hitler’s Germany in the ’30s. Remember how it felt to see a violent clash ensue between those celebrating hate and those standing against it? It was a wake up call for all of us as a country. For me, it was a call to action. My father used to say, silence is complicity, not original to him, but he believed it. At that moment, I knew I couldn’t stand by and let Donald Trump, a man who went on to say when asked about what he thought he said, there were very fine people on both sides, “Very fine people on both sides.” No president of the United States of America has ever said anything like that, see him continuing to attack everything that makes America America. I knew we were in the battle for the soul of the nation. That’s when I decided to run. I’m proud now to have Senator Harris at my side in that battle because she shares with the same intensity I do, for she’s someone who knows what’s at stake.(31:37)
The question is for all Americans to answer, who are we as a nation? What do we stand for? And most importantly, what do we want to be? Someone who knows that the future of this country is limited only by the barriers we place on our own imaginations because there’s nothing Americans cannot achieve what we put our minds to it and we do it together.(32:09)
One of the reasons I chose Kamala is because we both believe that we can define America simply in one word, possibilities. Possibilities. Let me say it again, possibilities. That’s America. That’s what sets this nation apart, is that everyone, everyone, the ability for everyone, and we mean everyone, to go as far and dream as big as hard work and their God-given ability will take them.(32:48)
When I agreed to serve as President Obama’s running mate, he asked me a number of questions, as I’ve asked Kamala, but the most important was he asked me, what I wanted most importantly. I told him I wanted to be the last person in the room before he made important decisions. That’s what I asked Kamala, I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room, to always tell me the truth, which she will, challenge my assumptions if she disagrees, ask the hard questions because that’s the way we make the best decisions for the American people. I got a chance to spend some time at my home today with Kamala and Doug, and I want to thank them. I thanked them then, but thank them publicly for agreeing to join and take this journey with Jill and me. Doug, you’re going to have to learn what it means to be a barrier breaker yourself in this job you’re about to take on, America’s first Second Gentlemen. And although they’re not with us here today, I want to thank Ella and Cole as well.(34:07)
I had a chance to speak to Doug’s mom and dad, and Ella and Cole, and we’re going to get our kids together to let them know what’s coming. My grandchildren are about the age of their children. I got to speak to them. My campaign has always been a family affair, every campaign I’ve run. So I’ve got some news for you, you’re all honorary Bidens. And here’s the best part, Kamala, you’ve been an honorary Biden for quite some time.(34:47)
I came first to know who Kamala was through our son, Beau Biden. They were friends. They served as attorneys general at the same time. They took on the same big fights together, Kamala in California, Beau here in Delaware. Big fights that helped change the entire country. I know how much Beau respected Kamala and her work, and that mattered a lot to me, to be honest with you, as I made this decision. So now we need to get to work, pulling this nation out of these crises we find ourselves in, getting our economy back on track, uniting this nation, and yes, winning the battle for the soul of America. My fellow Americans, now let me introduce to you for the first time, your next vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris. Kamala, the floor is yours. (36:03)
Thank you."
biden_speech_florida.txt,"(09:09)
Hello, hello, hello. (09:13)
Good to see you all. Please, please, take a seat if you have one. Thank you so very, very much for… It’s good to be back in Florida. I want to thank my good friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz, congresswoman. She’s been a tireless fighter. Where’s Debbie? There she is. Thank you, Debbie. You’ve been a friend a long time, and thank you for all the encouragement.(09:38)
Toby, I also want to thank you. Toby moved from a high rent district in Brooklyn. That’s the highest rent district in America right now these days. [inaudible 00:09:48], good to see you. I want to thank you for that kind introduction. It’s wonderful to be here with all of you to hear the stories, talk about how we’re going to get through these tough times, the difficult times. Today’s-(10:02)
… tough times and difficult times. Today’s story is a familiar one here in South Florida. We’re all living in some version of it right now with some of the most important parts of our lives being put on hold and the same story being lived by people like Carl Schechner, who many of you know well. Carl’s here today, I’m told. Hey Carl. How are you, man? Good to see you. The light was shining right in my eyes looking at you, man. I apologize. Carl is 39 years old. No, 93 years old, but he acts like he’s 39 years old. And the pillar of this community. So much so that a few years back, you all decided to rename this community center in his honor. I’ve heard wonderful things about you, Carl, and looking forward to saying hello to you privately.(10:58)
I had the pleasure of meeting Carl back in 2012. He may not remember it, but his story is what this community and this country is all about. Carl is a son of an immigrant. Carl served our nation honorably in the second World War and met his sweetheart, Anita, when they were … They’ve been married now for 67 years. Together, they built a family, four children, seven grandchildren. And more than 30 years, they made home here, staying engaged in all the local issues and holding local office, catching Sunday matinees and performances at the arts center and socializing with neighbors, enjoying nights in the town. And a couple of times, two, three times a week, going out.(11:42)
But their story, like so many others, is a quintessential American story these days, but it has been interrupted this year. Carl and Anita haven’t been out, I’m told, to a restaurant in seven months and there are no more Sunday matinees. Other than getting groceries, they spend most of their time in their apartment like so many people do. It’s harder than ever to spend time with the people you love, other than on Zoom or on a computer connection. We’ve all felt that sense of interruption in our lives. And we all know that this isn’t normal, that things didn’t have to be this bad. They didn’t have to be this bad. We look around at our neighbors and we know people are hurting. A lot of folks are worried about making their next rent payment, their next mortgage payment, whether or not they can purchase their prescription drugs or put food on the table. And we see an awful lot of people at the very top doing better than they’ve ever done and left to wonder an awful lot of us is, “Who’s looking out for me? Who’s looking out for me?”(12:47)
That’s been the entire story of my view of Donald Trump’s presidency. The fact that he’s never been focused on what matters. He’s never been focused on you. His handling of this pandemic has been erratic, just like his presidency has been. And it has prevented Florida’s seniors and people all across the country from getting the relief that they need. Donald Trump hasn’t just been willing to not do the work. I think it’s beyond that. I’m not sure he cares about delivering any real help. I think it’s both. People say he’s not willing to do the work. Well, I don’t think he cares much about it. While you’re losing precious time with your loved ones, he’s been stuck in a sand trap in one of his golf courses. And when he does decide to lift a finger, it doesn’t help you. It’s to propose new tax cuts for billionaires, and that’s not hyperbole. That’s not hyperbole. 100 wealthiest billionaires in America are expected to get another $30 billion tax cut he’s proposing.(13:48)
We know what happened the last time a tax cut was passed in 2017 when he came into office. Pharmaceutical companies got billions of dollars in tax breaks, and then they turned around and raised prices for medicines that you rely on to stay healthy. And they’re still doing it even during the pandemic. And quite frankly, it’s unconscionable. But Trump doesn’t really care about lowering the healthcare costs because he’s beholden to the health insurance companies and the drug companies. After all, he’s asking the United States Supreme Court as I speak, he’s asking them right now to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, which would eliminate seniors’ ability … Most of you are on Medicare, but it would eliminate your ability in that act we passed, I was able to help put in place, was that you’d have preventative services and annual checkups and mammograms for free under Medicare. If it gets struck down, that gets wiped out as well. The rise in prescription drug prices for millions of seniors put Medicare trust fund at risk.(14:54)
And by the way, we used to talk about the Medicare trust fund. I say the Republicans want to eliminate it. But remember, Debbie will remember when, he’s not a bad guy in terms of his personality, but when the former Speaker of the House became Speaker, what’d they do? They proposed a half a billion dollar cut in Medicare from the start, right off the bat. These guys mean what they say. This President, as Debbie pointed out, has pledged to terminate the tax that’s dedicated to financing social security. Terminate it. A social security actuary, not Joe Biden or a liberal think tank or a newspaper. The actuary, the social security says, that would bankrupt social security in just a few years, putting those monthly checks for tens of millions of seniors that they rely on, and many of them, the only thing they rely on, at risk.(15:47)
All this president knows how to do is play games with people’s lives and families’ futures. Last week, he announced he was “walking away from the negotiations” that he never fully engaged in. He’s not walking away. He never fully engaged in them. To provide any additional relief for American families. Debbie, working like the devil in the house, they passed the HEROES Act. They passed two other pieces of legislation earlier to provide for the ability to keep people from going out of business, people being kicked out of their homes, et cetera. He turned his back on small businesses that are struggling to keep their doors open. He turned his back on firefighters and police officers and first responders who depend on local budgets, but local budgets are being broken and they have to be balanced.(16:36)
I’ll just make note here. When we inherited the largest recession, the greatest recession since the depression, what happened? President put me in charge of the Recovery Act, $800 billion. First thing I was able to do, and I was able to manage it myself, was I put $147 billion to just help state and local authorities be able to balance their budgets, not have to fire police officers, not have to fire firefighters, not to fire first responders, not have to close down health clinics. Local governments are strained to the breaking point. He turned his back on educators and school children, standing in the way of support to get them PPE and cleaning supplies and ventilation needed to reopen schools safely, which we could do if we funded it. He turned his back on every single worker whose job hasn’t come back.(17:25)
And now he says he wants a deal. One day he’s tweeting that the relief package is too big. The next day saying it’s too small. It’s all game. He thinks he’s still on his game show. No really. He acts that way. For real. This is a political game he’s playing. His latest gimmick, he wants to mail seniors a $200 prescription drug cash card with his name on it. So you’re going to get it before election with his name on it. But what are you going to do? He’s going to raid Medicare trust fund to pay for that $200, which seniors have already spent by paying money into. He thinks that he can take the money out of your pocket with one hand and put it back with his name stamped on it in the other hand and call it a gift. It’s dishonest. It’s reckless. And it doesn’t actually help anybody. In fact, all it will do is undermine the Medicare trust fund and increase overall out-of-pocket costs for seniors.(18:29)
Let’s be clear about this. Donald Trump has tried for almost four years, he says he wants to lower the drug price. Okay? But he hadn’t done a single thing to do it. In fact, the House of Representatives passed a bill that Debbie supported that would bring down prescription drug costs across the board, giving Medicare the power in Washington, Medicare department, the power to negotiate with the drug companies and say, “If an aspirin is going to cost, if we’re being charged …” I’m making this up. “If an aspirin is going to cost two cents an aspirin,” they said, “We’re only going to pay you a penny an aspirin.” They’re either going to do it or not. They’re going to have to do it. We’ve been fighting to get, Debbie and I and others, have been fighting to be able to do this for years. It would lower drug prices. What did President Trump do? He said, “If it passes, he’ll veto it.” Threatened to veto it. Folks, Donald Trump’s chaotic and divisive leadership has cost us far too much. 215,000 deaths from COVID-19 and rising. Experts say we’ll lose nearly another 200,000 lives in the next few months unless we fundamentally change courses. You know, I prayed for his recovery when he got COVID and I’d hoped at least he’d come out of it somewhat chastened. But what has he done? He’s just doubled down on the misinformation he did before and making it worse.(20:03)
He’s just doubled down on the misinformation he did before and making it worse. So many lives have been lost unnecessary because this President cares more about the stock market than he does about the well-being of seniors.(20:13)
One day before we crossed the threshold of 200,000 deaths, you may recall this, the President was at the campaign rally and insistent that the virus was, and I quote, “Affects virtually nobody, just elderly people with heart and other problems.” Nobody. Think about that. Who was he talking about when he said it infects virtually nobody? He was talking about America’s seniors. He was talking about you. He was talking about my family. You’ve worked hard your whole life contributing to society, building a family, building the country, serving America. You deserve security. You deserve respect and peace of mind, but you’re not getting it.(21:05)
And by the way, if this wasn’t so bizarre, if I tried to make a movie talking about something like this in America, you’d think I was making it up. Because Donald Trump, it’s simple, not a joke, you’re expendable. You’re forgettable. You’re virtually nobody. That’s how he sees seniors. That’s how he sees you.(21:29)
It’s no surprise this is the same man that looks at Americans who put their lives on the line like you did, sir, and many others maybe in this room, for our nation and calls them losers and suckers. I carried this card with me every day for the last 15 years. It’s my schedule. In the back of this schedule, I have a black box. It says, “Daily troop update.” The number of troops who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, 6,924. Not roughly 6,900, 924 because every one of these fallen angels that left a family behind deserves to be remembered. Everyone. US troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, 53,000, as of today, 194. Everyone with only one sacred obligation, America, to care for those we send a war and equip them when they come home and take care of them and their families. And what did he say? Losers.(22:40)
My son volunteered to go to Iraq for a year. Before that, he had been in Kosovo for eight months. Best of my knowledge, the only foreigner who has a war monument and a major highway in that country named after him for his contribution to helping them set up their criminal justice system, then he volunteered to go to Iraq as attorney general for a year. My son was not a loser. And all of those left behind, he’s passed away, but all those left behind, they were heroes. They were patriots. I imagine that’s one of the reasons why six four-star generals and a whole lot of others have endorsed me who used to work for him because they know where his heart isn’t.(23:28)
That’s how he sees us. That’s the attitude he’s brought toward this whole crisis. This is the same man, you may remember, when he was told we were averaging 1000 lives lost per day, remember what he said? He said, “It is what it is.” Such concern and empathy. It is what it is. Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. That’s why it is what it is. This President, as Debbie referenced, back in January when he was being briefed by the intelligence community, he said, “I never read the briefing.” Didn’t know what was in. Didn’t have time. Well, [inaudible 00:24:15] ego moved him to try to convince a famous journalist to write something good about him. What happened? Bob Woodward interviewed him. He acknowledged that he knew it was a dangerous and highly communicable disease, but he did nothing. He didn’t do a thing. He didn’t tell you. He didn’t tell any American. Why? He told Woodward on tape, he told Bob he didn’t want to panic the American public.(24:55)
Americans don’t panic. Trump panics. His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis is unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is the President, the more reckless he seems to get. Thank God we only have three weeks left to go.(25:14)
Dr. Fauci, the most respected doc in the country on these issues, referred to the President’s announcement on the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden, using the White House as a backdrop for political events. He said it was a super spreader event. And how is Trump responding? He’s running a national ad quoting Dr. Fauci out of context. Fauci had said way back in March, referring to public health officials across the nation, he said, quote, “I can’t imagine anybody could be doing more,” end of quote, meaning public health officials.(25:57)
But the Trump campaign, which is not unusual because I’ve had a piece of it, the trump campaign has deliberately lied. They have put Dr. Fauci in their ad asserting that Fauci was talking about Trump when he said they couldn’t have done anymore. And Fauci’s a man of integrity. After that ad came out, he said, “I did not give permission to use that quote and I wasn’t referring to the President.” Even after Fauci said that he didn’t say that about the President, the Trump ad campaign said they were going to continue to use the ad knowing it was a lie. Can any of you ever remember anything like that in a presidential campaign with a mainstream candidate?(26:55)
And as a consequence to months of lying and misleading and irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs are around the dining room table tonight because of his negligence? How many people’s hearts are broken? How many people have trouble going to sleep at night because you can’t just reach over and touch? They can’t hear their son or daughter’s voice on the phone, while he throws super spreader parties at the White House where Republicans hug each other without concern to the consequences.(27:42)
How many of you have been unable to hug your grandkids in the last seven months? I got six of them. Two of them I just see [inaudible 00:27:53] children, a boy and a girl live not far from me and they can walk through the woods. The only way I can see them, I stand in the back porch and they stand down and I bribe them with Haagen-Dazs bars. But every single day I contact them. But I can’t hug them. I can’t embrace it. And I’m luckier than most because they’re nearby, those two of those six.(28:21)
My grandkids, your grandkids, we hope will grow up to treat one another with kindness, respect and empathy, qualities the President has never, ever shown. It’s become painfully clear as his careless arrogant, reckless COVID response has caused one of the worst tragedies in American history. The only senior that Donald Trump cares about, the only senior is the senior Donald Trump [inaudible 00:28:52] seem to do anything for.(28:53)
And by the way, minority communities are getting particularly hit by this. You realize as of about a month ago, on a percentage basis, 1 in 1000 African Americans in all of American have died. And the estimate is, by the end of this year, 1 in 500 African Americans in America will die. 1 in 500. If he doesn’t do something quickly and we hit 400,000, that is more people, the same number of people that died in the war you fought of all four years. 400,000 dead in War War II, in less than a year if he doesn’t move. The only one Donald Trump would do anything for is Donald Trump.(29:57)
Look, folks, you all know we’re so much better than this. We-(30:02)
We’re so much better than this. We can contain this virus. We can fully reopen our economy. We can bring Congress together to pass real relief, and then implement a comprehensive agenda to build back better. My economic proposal … And by the way, it’s not a liberal think tank or a Democratic think tank that says this. An independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a Wall Street firm, projects that my economic plan will create 18.6 million good paying jobs between now and the end of the first term. Seven million more jobs than the President’s plan. And create a trillion more dollars in economic growth than the President’s plan. It’s solid. It’s real.(30:49)
Here’s how my plan works. I’m not going to raise taxes on a single solitary American making less than $400,000 a year. You won’t pay a penny more. It’s a guarantee. But I’m going to ask big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay their fair share to straighten out the tax structure. That money will allow us to invest in working people. I carry it with me … I don’t know if I have it with me now, I don’t … a card that lists all of what is in the tax code. We went ahead, the President’s tax plan, Barack and I were suggesting we reduce corporate tax from 35% to 28. That was the consensus. He reduced it to 21%. You know how much that costs? $1.3 trillion. We just take it back up to 28, and we’ll generate $1.3 trillion more.(31:47)
91 of the Fortune 500 companies don’t pay a penny in tax. Not a single solitary cent. If we made sure there was a minimum tax at 15%, that would add another $400 billion. We’re going to take this money and we’re going to invest in a working people, in a growing middle class and make sure everyone is included in the deal. I want tax reform in the tax code because we’re spending your tax dollars on the wrong things. As I said, Donald Trump cut the tax from 35 to 21 costing the treasury a fortune. As I said, if we raised it back to 28%, $1.3 trillion would be coming to the treasury over the next decade, instead of giving big corporations hundreds of billions to pay for buying back their own stock, moving jobs overseas.(32:41)
We should invest it in cures for cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. That’s why I proposed giving the National Institute of Health $50 billion over the next four years to go after cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. If we do not, and no drug company has the capacity to do it, if we do not find an answer to Alzheimer’s, then the next 19 years, every single solitary bed that exists in the United States of America now will be occupied by an Alzheimer’s patient.(33:21)
Look, my dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joey, if everything’s equally important to you, nothing’s important to you. You have to have priorities.” What are our priorities? Our priorities is to make sure that everybody in America has an equal shot. This is about you. It’s about what’s fair. It’s about what our priorities should be, and we can deal with the scourge of cancer and these other diseases when Donald Trump has no interest. In fact, he wants to do the opposite. He proposes more tax cuts for the super wealthy. Like Donald Trump, we’re going to ease the burden on major costs in your life, unlike him. Including the financial burden of caregiving so many families are now carrying.(34:05)
Right now, as you probably know, and you have friends, 800,000 Americans are eligible for home community care through Medicaid, signed up for it, have been waiting an average of five years. They’re waiting for a phone call back. For some, five years. My plan makes a bold investment so the states can clear the waiting list and also take the pharmaceutical companies. Will allow Medicaid to, again, use its enormous bargaining power to negotiate prices and bring the costs down for everyone, not just seniors. Give all Americans access to those lower prices.(34:47)
And what he also hates my doing and so do the drug companies, we’re going to establish a board like it is in other countries of outside experts to set limits on the prices of new specialty drugs that are life-saving drugs that costs an arm and leg, figuratively and literally, that have no competition. This board is going to set up and say, “This is how much you can charge based on what you’ve invested. You make a healthy profit, but you will not be able to raise the price of the drug without proof that you’ve taken other action that you have required you to improve the drug.” So it can only be raised with the cost of medical inflation.(35:25)
Independent analysis found that my plan will slash the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. How many of you know somebody who’s had to sell things just to get the drugs that have gone up exponentially? We’re going to protect Social Security and increase benefits for millions of seniors. I’ll fight to protect your pensions, including fixing older employer pensions, so many Floridians earned and deserve. Folks, I guess we’ll see them with this. I’m confident. I know as bad as things are we say, “Oh my God, how can it get better?” I am absolutely confident we can do this and more. We just have to come together. I’m running as a proud Democrat. I’m going to govern as an American president. I’m going to work as hard for those who voted against me as those who voted for me.(36:20)
That’s the job of a president. A duty to care. To care for everyone. And after all we’ve been through, all America’s accomplished, all the years that we’ve stood as a beacon to the world, we cannot let ourselves remain divided, but we have to vote. Go to, Iwillvote.com/fl. You can still request your vote by mail ballot. The deadline’s October 24. Request your ballot. If you have it already mail it or drop it in one of the drop boxes today. Look, I’m tired of us all walking around with our heads down, as if there’s nothing we can do. This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity, nothing we’ve ever decided to do we’ve not accomplished, when we done it together. Remember when we were kids, you had to learn about famous speech John Kennedy made about going to the moon. Everybody remembers the different pieces of it.(37:29)
The part I remember, my college used to kid me in the Senate when I was there. When answering the unasked question, “Why was he doing it?” He said, “Because we refuse to postpone.” We refuse to postpone one more day, which is within our capacity as Americans to do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to our future. We’ve got to stand up, lift our heads up. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. And he’s well on the way trying to do that. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. That’s within who we are. Who we are. We choose hope over fear. Unity, over division. Science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies. We can do this folks. I promise you. But you got to vote. May god bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for listening. You’re a very patient audience. Thank you, thank you. Appreciate it."

An act of brutality so elemental, it did more than deny one more black man in America his civil rights and his human rights. It denied him of his very humanity. It denied him of his life. Depriving George Floyd as it deprived Eric Garner, one of the things, every human being must be able to do, breathe, so simple, so basic, so brutal. With the same thing happened with Aubrey. The same thing happened with Brianna Taylor. The same thing with George Floyd. We’ve spoken their names aloud. We’d cried them out in pain and in horror. We chiseled them into a long suffering hearts. They’re the latest additions to the endless list of stolen potential wiped out unnecessarily. It’s a list that dates back more than 400 years; black men, black women, black children, the original sin of this country still stains our nation today.(01:00)
And sometimes we manage to overlook it. We just pushed forward with a thousand other tasks in our daily life, but it’s always there. And weeks like this, we see it plainly, that we’re a country with an open wound. None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us can any longer can we hear the words I can’t breathe and do nothing. We can’t fail victims like what Martin Luther King called “The appalling silence of good people.” Every day African-Americans go about their lives with a constant anxiety and trauma wondering who would be next? Imagine if every time your husband or son, wife or daughter left the house, you feared for their safety from bad actors and bad police. Imagine if you had to have that talk with your child about not asserting your rights, taking the abuse handed out to them just so they could make it home.(02:03)
Imagine having police called on you just for sitting in Starbucks or renting an Airbnb or watching birds. This is the norm black people in this country deal with. They don’t have to imagine it. The anger and frustration and the exhaustion, it’s undeniable, but that’s not the promise of America. It’s long past time that we made the promise of this nation real for all people. This is no time for incendiary tweets. It’s no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis. We need real leadership right now, leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism. It’s time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It’s time for us to face that deep open wound we have in this nation.(03:00)
We need justice for George Floyd. We need real police reform that hold cops to a higher standard that so many of them actually meet. That holds bad cops accountable then repairs relationship between law enforcement and the community they’re sworn to protect. We need to stand up as a nation with the black community, with all minority communities, and come together as one America. That’s the challenge we face. It’s going to require those of us who sit in some position of influence to finally deal with the abuse of power. The pain is too immense for one community to bear alone. I believe it’s the duty of every American to grapple with it and to grapple with it now. With our complacency and our silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence. Nothing about this will be easy or comfortable, but do we simply allow this wound to scab over once more without treating the underlying injury, we’ll never truly heal.(04:05)
The very soul of America is at stake. We must commit as a nation to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. We have to pursue it with real urgency. We’ve got to make real, the promise of America, which we’ve never fully grasped. That all men and women are equal. Not only in creation, but throughout their lives. Again, to George’s family, thanks for taking the time to talk to me. I promise you, I promise you, we’ll do everything in our power to see to it that justice is had for your brother, your cousin’s case. God love y’all. Folks, we got to stand up. We got to move. We got to change.(05:23)
It’s always been here. It’s always been here. We just haven’t came together yet, but I’m starting to feel it. I’m starting to feel it. I’m starting to feel it. And I thank God for everybody here, but we came for justice. We came for convictions. I definitely came because this city is definitely going to take care of my brother’s kids. He has two beautiful daughters that he can’t provide for. Two nights ago I’m on the phone with Roxy. Gigi don’t even know. She still ain’t told her daughter so she decides to tell her while I’m on the phone."

Hello, hello, hello. What a magnificent setting. It’s hard, when you’re driving here, not to think of the circumstances President Roosevelt faced and how he overcame so much for so many. So, good afternoon.(03:17)
A few weeks ago, I spoke at Gettysburg about the need to unite our nation, and today I’m here at Warm Springs because I want to talk about how we’re going to heal our nation. Over these past few months, there’s been so much pain, and so much suffering, and so much loss in America. Over 225,000 people have lost their lives to a virus. Many of those lives lost the cruelest way possible: alone. Alone in a hospital room, alone in a nursing home, no family, no friends, no loved ones beside them in those final moments, and it haunts so many of the surviving families, families who were never given a chance to say goodbye. I, and many of you know, what loss feels like when you lose someone you love, you feel that deep black hole opening up on your chest and you feel like you’re being swallowed into it.(04:26)
The tragic truth of our time is that COVID has left a deep and lasting wound in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and we see the empty storefronts and the shuttered businesses, the visible signs of lost hopes and broken dreams. But what we don’t see is all those parents staring at the ceiling late at night wondering, how am I going to pay the mortgage? How am I going to pay for our rent? What are they going to do if one of my kids get sick, now that I’ve lost my health insurance. Growing up, like many of you, I watched my father struggle to find work. He made what I call the longest walk any parent can make, up a short flight of stairs to his children’s bedroom to tell a child you can’t play in that little league team anymore, you can’t go back to the same school.(05:34)
We can’t stay here, Joey. We can’t stay in Scranton anymore. We have to move. There are good jobs in Delaware. When I get one, I’ll come back for you, your sister, your brother, and your mom. It’s only 157 miles away, Joey. My father came home every weekend for that year or more, but he always said, when we finally got settled in Delaware, he used to say, “Joey, a job’s”, and all my friends would hear it as well, “A job’s about a lot more than a paycheck.” My sister heard it as well, Valerie. He said, “It’s about your dignity, a job. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” And right now, on this autumn afternoon, millions of Americans all across this country feel they’ve lost all that.(06:31)
A season of protest has broken out all across the nation. Some of it is just senseless burning and looting and violence that can’t be tolerated and won’t, but much of it is a cry for justice from a community that’s long had a knee of injustice on their neck. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake. They’ll not soon be forgotten, not by me, not by us, and not by this country. They’re going to inspire a new wave of justice in America. These are historic, painful crises. The insidious virus, the economic anguish, the systematic discrimination, and one of them could have rocked the nation, any one of them. Yet, we’ve been hit by all three at once. But if we’re honest with ourselves, the pain striking at the heart of our country goes back not months but years. Our politics for too long hae been mean and bitter and divisive, you can hear it now in the distance. We’ve stopped seeing dignity in one another. We’ve stopped showing each other respect.(07:54)
Too many among us spend more time shouting than listening, more time fighting than working together, more time demonizing and denigrating others than lifting them up. The divisions in our nation are getting wider. Angry people are upset, anger and suspicion are growing, and our wounds are getting deeper. It may, and many wonder, has it gone too far? Have we passed the point of no return? Has the heart of this nation turned to stone? I don’t think so. I refuse to believe it. I know this country, I know our people, and I know we can unite and heal this nation. Warm Springs is a good place to talk about hope and healing. So Franklin Roosevelt came, “To use the therapeutic waters to rebuild himself.” Stricken by polio, the polio virus in 1921, he suffered from paralysis. Like many other Americans in those pre-vaccine decades, FDR longed to live an independent life, a life that wasn’t defined by his illness. To him, and to so many others facing physical challenges, Warm Springs offered therapy for the body, and I might add, and the soul, but it offered something else as well.(09:33)
FDR came looking for a cure, but it was the lessons he learned here that he used to lift a nation. Humility, empathy, courage, optimism. This place represented a way forward. A way of restoration, of resilience, of healing. In the years that followed, FDR would come back to Warm Springs often to think about how to heal the nation and the world, and that’s exactly what he did. Lifting us out of a great depression, defeating tyranny, saving democracy. Then it was here on April 12th, 1945, that President Roosevelt died. A casualty of war as surely as any who fell in combat, and the free world mourned. American leaders wept. Maybe even more important was the reaction of the American people. Naval Chief Petty Officer Graham Jackson, a black man, cried as he played his accordion in tribute to FDR, not far from here.(10:52)
And the story is told that when Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s procession went by, a man collapsed in grief. The neighbor asked him, “Did you know the president?” The response was “No,” the man said, “but he knew me.” He knew me. Few words better describe the kind of president our nation needs right now. A President who is not in it for himself, but for others. A President who doesn’t divide us, but unites us. A President who appeals not to the worst in us, but to the best. A President who cares less about his TV ratings and more about the American people. A President who looks not to settle scores, but to find solutions. A President guided not by wishful thinking, but by science, reason, and fact. That’s the kind of President I hope to be.(12:00)
I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American President. I’ll work with Democrats and Republicans. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as for those who do. That’s the job of a President, a duty of care for everyone. This place, Warm Springs, is a reminder that though broken, each of us can be healed. That as a people and a country, we can overcome this devastating virus. That we can heal a suffering world. And yes, we can restore our soul and save our country.(12:48)
In his last hours, President Roosevelt was at work on a speech to be delivered the next day. In it he was to say, “Today, we must cultivate the science of human relationships, the ability of all people, of all kinds, to live together and work together in the same world at peace.” To live together and work together. That’s how I see America. That’s how I see the presidency. And that’s how I see the future. I tell you this from my heart. I believe America and American hope, not fear. Unity, not division. Love, not hate. The presidency though, is only one part of the American chorus. History isn’t only a story of the great and the famous. No, our history is a story of we, the people, of all of us together.(13:53)
I’ve long said the story of America is a story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Change in our country comes when the voices of the powerless reach the ears of the powerful. When those whose names we’ll never know, but will risk their lives to, in the words of Dr. King, “Bend the arc of the moral universe towards justice.” Bending that arc is the work of our time, but it’ll take all of us. Red states, blue states, Republicans, Democrats, Conservatives, and Liberals. And I believe from the bottom of my heart, we can do it.(14:39)
People ask me, why are you so confident Joe? Because we are the United States of America. There’s nothing, nothing the American people can’t do and been unable to do if we put our minds to it. When news of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s death went out on the wires, an editor in Chicago, turned to his colleague and said “Clear the decks for action.” So I say to you today, if you’re giving me the honor of serving as your President, clear the decks for action.(15:16)
For we will act, we will act on the first day of my presidency to get COVID under control. We’ll act to pass my economic plan that will finally reward work, not wealth in this country. We’ll act to pass my health care plan to provide affordable, accessible healthcare for every American, and drug prices that are dramatically lowered. We’ll act to pass the Biden climate plan, meeting the challenges of a climate crisis while creating millions of good paying, high paying, labor jobs. We’ll act to address systemic racism in our country, and we’ll act to give working people a fair shot again in this country. And we’ll act to restore our faith in democracy and our faith in one another.(16:08)
Today, we’re facing a public health crisis of historic proportions. And with winter at hand, it’s getting worse. Just last Friday, 83,000 new cases in one day. Saturday, another 83,000 cases. Nearly 1000 people a day are dying. Another 200,000 deaths are expected over the next several months, and the President keeps telling us not to worry. He keeps telling us we’re turning the corner is his quote. He’s as removed from reality, and as offensive as when they told us the virus affects virtually nobody, just the elderly with heart conditions. Virtually nobody, just the elderly with heart conditions, as if they don’t matter.(17:13)
And when he said in response to the number of deaths reaching a thousand, he said, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. In the spring, the President declared, in his voice as Commander-in-Chief, says Commander-in Chief. He was going to wage war on the virus. Instead he shrugged, he swaggered, and he surrendered. Then his Chief of Staff just last week made a stunning admission, an admission that I believe, but never thought he’d say. Saying, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” End of quote. We’re not going to control the pandemic. It’s a capitulation. It’s a waving of a white flag. It’s a window into the shocking truth about this White House that they’ve never really tried.(18:19)
Think about all the frontline health professionals who’ve risked and some given their lives for the last nine months in this pandemic. Think about all the first responders. Think about all the grocery store clerks, the drivers, the delivery drivers of the trucks, teachers, parents, the kids home from school. Think about all those who have lost their jobs. Think about all those have been infected by the virus. Think about all those who have died. They were giving their all while their President was giving up. Well, I’m here to tell you: we can, and we will control this virus. As President, I will never wave the white flag of surrender. Just imagine where we’d be today if the President had embraced wearing masks instead of mocking it. Imagine where we’d be today if the president had practiced social distancing, instead of holding super spreader events. Imagine where we’d be with a comprehensive system of testing and tracing.(19:29)
I first put forward a detailed plan on how to deal with this virus back in March, this administration ignored it. Then I released several more detailed plans in the months that followed, the most recent just last week. This administration has yet to offer a single plan. Yes, one of the reasons why the most one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world, the New England Journal of Medicine, called the President “Dangerously incompetent.” Went on to say, “The President turned a crisis into a tragedy.”(20:07)
I’m ready to act. I know what to do. Starting on day one of my presidency, we will do it. I’ve talked about the battle for the soul of America since the very beginning of this campaign, and I want to be very clear in these closing days about what I mean, and about what I intend to do in that battle. To assure that our better angels prevail over our worst instincts. I believe this election is about who we are as a nation, what we believe, and maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It’s about our essence. It’s about what makes us Americans. It’s that fundamental. Time and again, throughout our history, we’ve seen charlatans, the con men, the phony populist, who sought the play on our fears, appeal to our worst appetites, and pick at the oldest scabs we have for their own political gain.(21:12)
They appear when the nation’s been hit the hardest and we’re at our most vulnerable, never to solve anything, but only the benefit themselves. In a recent encyclical, Pope Francis warns us against this phony populism, that appeals to “The basest and most selfish instincts.” He goes on to say, “Politics is something more noble than posturing, marketing, and media spin. These sow nothing but division, conflict, and a bleak cynicism.” He said, “For those who seek to lead, we do well to ask ourselves, why am I doing this? Why? What is my real aim?” Pope Francis asked questions that anyone who seeks to lead this great nation should be able to answer. And my answer is this: I run to unite this nation and to heal this nation. I’ve said that from the beginning. It is badly necessary.(22:21)
The Bible tells us there’s a time to break down, and a time to build up, a time to heal. This is that time. God and history have called us to this moment, and to this mission. With our voices and our votes, we must free ourselves from the forces of darkness, from the forces of division, and the forces of yesterday, and the forces that pull us apart, hold us down, and hold us back. And if we do so, we’ll once more become one nation under God, indivisible, a nation united, a nation strengthened, a nation healed. That is my goal. That is why I’m running. That is what we must do.(23:14)
Thank you all for being here, and may God bless America, and may God protect our troops. Stay safe and wear your mask."

Thank you all for being here. Thank you. I appreciate you being here on this gorgeous day in a magnificent, magnificent setting, until you think about all the lives that were lost here. Please, all have a seat.(03:39)
On July 4th, 1863, American woke to the remains of perhaps the most consequential battle in American soil. It took place here on this ground in Gettysburg; three days of violence, three days of carnage, 50,000 casualties, wounded, captured, missing, or dead, over three days of fighting. When the sun rose on that Independence Day, Lee would retreat. The war would go on for nearly two more years, but the back of the Confederacy had been broken. The Union would be saved. Slavery would be abolished, government of by and for the people would not perish from the earth, and freedom would be born anew in our land.(04:41)
There’s no more fitting place than here today in Gettysburg, to talk about the cost of division. About how much it has cost America in the past, about how much it is costing us now, and about why I believe in this moment, we must come together as a nation. For President Lincoln, the Civil War was about the greatest of causes. The end of slavery, widening equality, pursuit of justice, the creation of opportunity, and the sanctity of freedom.(05:20)
His words would live ever after. We hear them in our heads. We know them in our hearts. We draw on them when we seek hope in hours of darkness; “Four score, and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” Here on this sacred ground, Abraham Lincoln, re-imagined America itself. Here, a president of the United States spoke of the price of division, and the meaning of sacrifice.(06:07)
He believed in the rescue, redemption, and rededication of the union. All this in a time, not just of ferocious division, but of widespread death, structural inequity, and fear of the future. And he taught us this, a house divided could not stand. That is a great and timeless truth. Today, once again, we are a house divided, but that my friends can no longer be. We’re facing too many crises. We have too much work to do. We have to bright a future to have it shipwrecked on the Shoals of anger and hate, and division.(07:04)
As we stand here today, a century and a half later after Gettysburg, we should consider again, what can happen when equal justice is denied, when anger and violence and division are left unchecked. As I look across America today, I’m concerned. The country is in a dangerous place. Our trust in each other is ebbing. Hope seems elusive. Too many Americans see our public life, not as an arena for mediation of our differences, but rather they see it as an occasion for total, unrelenting, partisan warfare.(07:49)
Instead of treating each other’s party as the opposition, we treat them as the enemy. This must end. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country. A spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I’ve been saying it for two years now, I’m accused of being naive. I’m told, “Maybe that’s the way things used to work, Joe, but they can’t work that way anymore.” Well, I’m here to tell you they can, and they must if we’re going to get anything done.(08:26)
I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I’ll work with Democrats and Republicans. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me, as those who do. That’s the job of a president; the duty to care for everyone. It was a lot of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control. It’s a decision. It’s a choice we make.(09:00)
And if we can decide not to cooperate, we can decide to cooperate as well. That’s the choice I’ll make as president. But there’s something bigger going on in this nation than just our broken politics. Something darker, something more dangerous. I’m not talking about ordinary differences of opinion, competing viewpoints give life and vibrancy to our democracy. No, I’m talking about something different, something deeper. Too many Americans seek not to overcome our divisions, but to deepen them, we must seek not to build walls, but bridges. We must seek not to have our fist clenched, but our arms open. We have to seek not to tear each other apart, we seek to come together. You don’t have to agree with me on everything, or even on most things, to see that we’re experiencing today is neither good nor normal.(10:14)
I made the decision to run for president after Charlottesville. Close your eyes, and remember what you saw. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the KKK coming out of the fields with torches light, veins bulging, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile herd across Europe in the ’30s. It was hate on the march, in the open, in America. Hate never goes away, it only hides. And when it’s given oxygen, when it’s given an opportunity to spread, when it’s treated as normal and acceptable behavior, we’ve opened a door in this country that we must move quickly to close. As president, that’s just what I will do. I will send a clear unequivocal message to the entire nation, there is no place for hate in America.(11:20)
It will be given no license. It will be given no oxygen. It’ll be given no safe harbor. In recent weeks and months, the country has been riled by instances of excessive police force, heart-wrenching cases of racial injustice and lives needlessly and senselessly lost, by peaceful protesters, given voice to the calls for justice, by examples of violence and looting and burning that can not be tolerated. I believe in law and order, I’ve never supported defunding the police.(11:57)
But I also believe injustice is real. It’s a product of a history that goes back 400 years, the moment when black men, women, and children first were brought here in chains. I do not believe we have to choose between law and order, and racial justice in America. We can have both. This is the nation strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong enough to provide safe streets for our families and small businesses. The two often bear the brunt of this looting and burning.(12:35)
We have no need for armed militias roaming America’s streets, and we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacy groups, menacing our communities. If you say, “We should trust America’s law enforcement authorities to do the job,” as I do, then let them do their job without extremist groups acting as vigilantes. If you say, “We have no need to face racial injustice in the country,” you haven’t opened your eyes to the truth in America.(13:07)
There’ve been powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months, George Floyd’s, six year old daughter, who I met with, who looked at me and said in her small child’s voice, “Daddy changed the world.” Also, Jacob Blake’s mother was another. When she said, “Violence didn’t reflect her son and this nation needed healing.” And Doc Rivers, the basketball coach, choking back tears when he said, “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung. It’s amazing [inaudible 00:13:49] we keep loving this country and this country does not love us back.”(13:55)
I think about that. I think about what it takes for a black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country. That has for far too long, never been recognized. What we need in America’s leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, to open lines of communications, to bring us together, to heal, to hope. As president, that’s precisely what I will do. We paid a high price for allowing the deep divisions in this country to impact on how we deal with the Coronavirus. 210,000 Americans dead, and the number’s climbing. It’s estimated that nearly another 210,000 Americans could lose their lives by the end of the year; enough, no more. Let’s just set partisanship aside, let’s end the politics and follow the science.(14:58)
Wearing a mask is not a political statement. It’s a scientific recommendation. Social distancing isn’t a political statement. It’s a scientific recommendation. Testing, tracing, the development and all approval and distribution of a vaccine, isn’t a political statement. It is a science-based decision. We can’t undo what has been done. We can’t go back. We can do so much better. We can do better starting today. We can have a national strategy that puts politics aside and saves lives.(15:40)
We can have a national strategy that will make it possible for our schools and business to open safely. We can have a national strategy that reflects the true values of this nation. This pandemic is not a red state or blue state issue. This virus doesn’t care whether you live, or where you live, what political party you belong to, it affects us all. It will take anyone’s life. It’s a virus. It’s not a political weapon.(16:11)
There’s another enduring division in America that we must end, the division in our economic life. That gives opportunity only to the privileged few. America has to be about mobility. It has to be the kind of country where an Abraham Lincoln, a child of the distant frontier, can rise to the highest office in the land. America has to be about possibilities.(16:38)
The possibility of prosperity, not just for the privileged few, but for the many, for all of us. Working people on their kids deserve an opportunity. Lincoln knew this. He said that the country had to give people, and I quote, “An open field and a fair chance. An open field and a fair chance.” That’s what we’re going to do in America. We’re going to build together. We fought a civil war that would secure a union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all.(17:16)
And by fits and starts, our better angels had prevailed again, just enough, just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation. And those better angels can prevail again, now. They must prevail again, now. 100 years after Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg, the vice president, Lyndon B Johnson also came here, and here’s what he said.(17:46)
He said, “Our nation founded soul and honor in these fields of Gettysburg, we must not lose that soul in dishonor, now, on the fields of hate.” Today, we’re engaged, once again, in the battle for the soul of the nation, the forces of darkness, the forces of division, the forces of yesterday are pulling us apart, holding us down and holding us back. We must free ourselves of all of them. As president, I will embrace hope, not fear. Peace, not violence. Generosity, not greed. And light, not darkness. I’ll be a president who appeals to the best in us, not the worst.(18:38)
I’ll be a president who pushes toward the future, not one who clings to the past. I’m ready to fight for you and for our nation every day, without exception, without reservation, with a full and devoted heart. We cannot, and will not, allow extremest and white supremacist to overturn the America of Lincoln and Harriet Tubman, and Frederick Douglas, to overturn the America that has welcomed immigrants from distant shores, to overturn the America that has been a Haven and a home for everyone, no matter their background.(19:16)
From Seneca falls to Selma, to Stonewall we’re at our best when the promise of America is available to all, we cannot, and we will not allow violence in the street to threaten the people of this nation. We cannot and will not walk away from our obligation to at long last, face the wrecking on race and racial justice in this country. We cannot and will not continue to be struck in the partisan politics that lets us, this virus, thrive, while the public health of this nation suffers.(19:55)
We cannot and will not accept an economic equation that only favors those who have already got it made; everybody deserves a shot at prosperity. Folks, duty and history call presidents to provide for the common good, and I will. It won’t be easy. Won’t be easy. Our divisions today are long standing, economic and racial inequities have shaped us for generations, but I give you my word. I give you my word. If I’m elected president, I will Marshall the ingenuity and Goodwill of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together because I think people are looking for that. We can disagree about how as we move forward, we must take the first steps. It starts with how we treat one another. How we talk to one another. How we respect one another.(21:04)
In the second inaugural Lincoln said, “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we’re in to build up the nation’s wounds, bind up the nation’s wounds.” Now, we have our work to reunite America. To bind up our nation’s wounds. To move past shadow and suspicion. And so we, you and I together, we press on, even now. After hearing the second inaugural address, Frederick Douglas told President Lincoln, “Mr. Lincoln, that was a sacred effort.” We have to be dedicated to our own sacred effort. The promise of Gettysburg and the new birth of freedom was in hand.(22:04)
I think it’s at risk. Every generation that’s followed Gettysburg has been faced with a moment when it must answer this question, will they allow the sacrifices made here to be in vain, or be fulfilled? This is our moment to answer this essential American question, for ourselves and for our time. And my answer is this, it cannot be that after all this country has been through, after all that America’s accomplished, after all the years, we have stood as a beacon of light to the world.(22:41)
It cannot be that here and now in 2020, we will allow the government of the people, by the people, and for the people to perish this earth. No, it cannot. And it must not. We have it in our hands, the ultimate power. The power to vote. Its the note instrument ever devised to register our will in a peaceable and productive fashion. And so we must. We must vote. We will vote. No matter how many obstacles are thrown in our way, because once America votes, America will be heard.(23:24)
Lincoln said, “The nation is worth fighting for.” So it was. And so it is, together as one nation under God, indivisible. Let us join forces to fight the common foe of injustice and inequality, hate and fear. Let’s conduct ourselves as Americans who love each other, who love our country, who will not destroy, but will build. We owe it to the dead who were buried here at Gettysburg. We owe that to the living, and to future generations yet to be born.(24:07)
You and I are part of a covenant, a common story of divisions overcome and hope renewed. If we do our part, if we stand together, if we keep faith with the past and with each other, then the divisions of our time will give way to the dreams of a brighter, better future. This is our work. This is our pledge. This is our mission. We can end this era of division. We can end the hate and the fear. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. We can do this."
biden_speech_health_care.txt,"(00:00)
Hello, Michigan. Hi, how are you? What’s your name? Sam, good to see you, man. Thanks for being here. I appreciate it. Alexia, thank you for taking the time telling your story, it’s important. Unfortunately, there are an awful lot of stories like yours all over America as I travel the country, too many, it don’t have to be. And, folks, it’s great to be back, it’s great to be here.(00:39)
There’s not a better governor in the United States of America than Gretchen Whitmer, that’s a fact. I’ve met virtually all of them. And Gary, we badly need you back in the United States Senate, pal, we badly need you back in the United States Senate. And then my sister, Debbie Stabenow. God love you, Debbie. We worked so closely together for so long and as vice-president as well.(01:13)
Folks, look, we need to send Gary back to another term. Standing up for Michigan, Michigan families, small businesses. He was our main congressional partner back in 2010 when we passed the critical legislation supporting small businesses. I remember the president gave me the responsibility to go out and round up support. My go-to guy to get it done, I mean it sincerely was Gary. He was the go-to guy and he always shows up and he always shows up for Michigan.(01:51)
And like all of you, Jill and I are so grateful that the governor and her family are safe. It’s an unusual year. Governor you’ve been through a lot but my Lord, you are a leader. You stand up straight and tall and you don’t bend. Governor, it’s not easy to lead in moments of crisis but that’s a determination of whether you are a real leader when you stepped up to the crisis and you’ve stepped up, you’ve done it and you keep doing it.(02:18)
And as I said a moment ago you’re pretty much doing it better than anybody else in the whole United States of America. You’ve shown this whole nation just how tough and thoughtful you are, tough just like Michigan. I’ve got to believe this state has to be so proud of you. I know personally I am as I’ve gotten to know you and proud to call your friend, gov.(02:45)
We’re grateful to the FBI and law enforcement to discover these domestic terrorists and stop them. And make no mistake, that’s who they are, domestic terrorists, flat terrorists. Planning to blow up a bridge on American soil, to threaten the lives of police officers, to kidnap an elected later and now we’re finding out the same thing was happening in Virginia. It’s the sort of behavior you might expect from ISIS and it should shock the conscious of every American, every American. And the failure to condemn these folks is stunning from the outset. I remember it matters. You’ve heard me say it before, “Words matter.” And the words of a president particularly matter. When the president tweeted, “Liberate Michigan, liberate Michigan,” that’s the call that was heard, that was the dog whistle. Just like when he said, “Very fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.” Fathers, they came out of the fields carrying torches, their veins bulging, shouting antisemitic bile, carrying Nazi flags accompanied by the Klu Klux Klan.(04:10)
But when a young woman was killed protesting the president was asked what he think and he said something no president has ever, ever, ever, ever heard, “There were very fine people on both sides.” Those words were heard just like when he stood on the debate stage with me and refused to denounce white supremacists but told that white ring extremist group to “stand back and stand by.” Stand back and stand by, an American president? Not only shocked us but it stunned the world. Those words we heard.(05:09)
You know the reason I decided to run for president and I know that Debbie knows this. I hadn’t planned on running ever again after my son died. But when I saw those folks coming out of those woods I thought, “How in God’s name, how in God’s name can I remain silent?” And I said at the time it was somewhat not criticized but people didn’t think it was… Well, I don’t know what it was. When I said, “I think we’re in a battle for the soul of America,” I think we are.(05:47)
What I saw at Charlottesville and the president’s response to it is why I went to Gettysburg Battlefield of Pennsylvania last week. Because I thought there was need to stand up to hate in America and urge as Lincoln did to come together as a nation. Well, I’ve learned hate never goes away, it only hides. It never goes away, and if you’re given oxygen it comes out from one of the rocks, it grows. We need to be clear from the president going down in this country, there is no place for hate in America, period, none, it will not be tolerated.(06:37)
But President Trump revels in division and chaos to do anything to distract us from focusing on his failures to deal with this virus and to protect the nation. He’s still living in a dream world. He keeps telling us that this virus is going to disappear like America. He said, I think last night in his town hall, I didn’t have the pleasure of hearing it, I was doing one myself. He said, “We have turned the corner.” And my grandfather was sitting in my chair where he said, “He’s gone around the bunny.”(07:24)
Turned the corner? My Lord. It’s not disappearing, in fact it’s on the rise again. It’s getting worse as predicted. And we all know the terrible price this nation has paid. Lives lost, unemployment way up, across Michigan and the country folks are worried about making their next rent payment and mortgage payment. Or their healthcare will be ripped away in the middle of a pandemic that you worked so damn hard, Gary, to keep. Worried about…(08:01)
And we talked about this, Alexia. Kids in school, are they able to get back to school? More than 215,000 Americans, I think it’s 217 as of this morning, Americans have died from COVID-19. And experts have said, and I’ve been saying for the last month and a half that nearly another 200,000 lives are likely to be lost in the coming months between now and the first of the year if we continue to refuse to follow science. Because he refused to embracing wearing a mask, how many times on television have you seen him make fun of Biden wearing a mask? Because he refuses to practice social distancing he puts his supporters in such jeopardy. It’s estimated…(09:01)
It’s estimated by his own folks, if we just wore masks nationally, almost 100,000 lives would be saved in the next few months. His own director of CDC said while we’re waiting for a vaccine, even if we had a vaccine, this will prevent more deaths between now and the end of January than a vaccine would. Know what’s really sad about all this? And I’ve been talking about this, but every time I repeat it, I get more… Well, I’m not very happy.(09:49)
The president knew and lied about knowing. He knew in January. The intelligence community and what they call the PDB, the Presidential Daily Briefings, which I’ve sat in on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them as vice-president. It got out that they laid out in detail to him how devastating this could be, how much life could be lost, and so on. He said he was unaware of it. Didn’t read those reports. Well, that surprised no one, he didn’t read the reports, but he didn’t read the reports. And everybody said, “Well, maybe he didn’t.”(10:38)
But then as was acknowledged because of his ego, he wanted to impress a famous journalist, he thought he could change his mind about his view of him, he did a long interview with Bob Woodward. Bob Woodward, a renowned journalist, taped the interview with him, extensive interviews, hours. And he taped an interview where Trump said he knew this disease was deadly, significantly worse than the flu. But that’s not what he told you. That’s not what he told the public.(11:25)
And the reason he lied again to the American people? Well, he said he didn’t want to panic the American people. Americans don’t panic. Donald Trump panicked. That’s who panicked. As a consequence of his overwhelming lying, negligence, and irresponsible action, how many empty chairs were around the kitchen table this morning or the dining room table last night? How many? How many women or men leaned over when they got in bed last night and reached over to touch their husband and wife, and they weren’t there? You all know what loss is. It’s profound, especially when it was avoidable, much of it.(12:29)
But mishandling the pandemic isn’t enough for Trump. On top of that, he’s still trying to take away your healthcare. Trump’s still determined in the midst of this pandemic. And by the way, if projections… Pray, God, they’re not right, Father. But if they’re right, though, in the next several months, there’ll be over 200,000 additional deaths. That would be in one year 400,000 Americans would have died. That’s more than lost in all of World War II, hear me? World War II was four years. More American souls would have been lost than in World War II.(13:20)
What’s he doing? He’s still determined to destroy the Affordable Care Act. This isn’t hyperbole. Just like your opponent calls it a disaster. Talk about a disaster, there’s a disaster. The guy is 2000% or 200%, whatever it is with Trump. Hope everybody remembers. Look, as I said, this isn’t hyperbole. It’s real, as real as it gets. On November 10th the United States Supreme Court will hear the Trump administration make the case that the Affordable Care Act should be struck down in its entirety.(14:05)
I know everybody thinks they know, but I just want to remind you 10 million of you have already lost your health insurance because your employer’s health insurance, they’ve gone out of business. 10 million Americans already without health insurance. If Trump gets his way, 20 million more Americans will lose their health care. That’s God awful. In the midst of this God awful economic crisis, 100 million Americans will lose their protections for pre-existing conditions, including more than 4 million people right here in Michigan. Lifetime limits on benefits will be back.(14:56)
And by the way, a lot of you’ve been through what I’ve been through and worse. I can distinctly remember sitting on a bed with my Beau, my son, who came back from a year serving in Iraq, which this president talks about losers who serve, losers. With the same significant disease that your mom had, stage four glioblastoma. When it was diagnosed, when he got home, we asked the docs. It was only a matter of months, not if, just months. We never gave up hope. I remember watching him on that bed. He made it almost 16 months.(16:11)
Toward the end, and this is not about me, it’s about all of you, I consciously thought to myself, what would it feel like if they were able to walk in and say, “Mr Biden, you’ve outrun your insurance coverage. Suffer the last two or three months in pain on your own. Lots of luck.” Because that’s what was happening before.(16:49)
Insurers, if they win, and that’s what this court packing going on now is about, insurers will no longer allow you to keep your kids on your policy till age 26 in the middle of this economic crisis. Women, once again, will be charged more for their healthcare just because they’re a woman. Older folks will be able to be charged more. And as the governor said, long-term complications from COVID will become pre-existing conditions, joining asthma, diabetes, even pregnancy is a preexisting condition before. It could allow insurers to jack up your premiums or deny coverage altogether.(17:34)
Getting rid of Obamacare is why they’re racing to get this nominee through the Supreme Court. Make no mistake about it. Trump’s made it clear from the beginning, as your opponent has. He wants to get rid of Obamacare in its entirety. And with this nominee, he’s made that incredibly clear, as well. Michigan deserves so much better. Deserves leaders like-(18:03)
Michigan deserves so much better, deserves leaders like Gary and Debbie Stabenow, public servants who lead with decency and honor, always look out for your needs, will think about how to ease the burden on your family.(18:22)
That’s the sort of leader you’ve got in Gretchen, in Governor Whitmer, as well. When she was in the state senate, she led the charge to secure Obamacare Medicaid expansion for more than 800,000 Michiganders. Think about this now. Some of those States, Republican governors did not expand, even though the federal government was paying for it front end. There’s millions of people have no coverage.(18:50)
After we passed Obamacare with the help of Debbie and Gary, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, we were able to reduce the uninsured rate by 55% here in Michigan. And if I have the honor of becoming your president, we’ll build on the Affordable Care Act, no matter what they do.(19:11)
You can choose to keep a private plan, if you still have one. Because some of the private plans negotiated, the UAW owners are good plans. But we’ll also offer you a Medicare like public health insurance option. It’ll force private insurers to keep premiums low and offer better coverage because, for the first time, they’ll have to compete for your business against a public insurer that doesn’t have the profit motive in mind.(19:38)
If you choose this public option or a private plan will increase subsidies for your premiums, so that they’re lower. You can afford our plans with lower deductibles, lower out-of-pocket spending. An independent analysis found that my plan will slash the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. Not a liberal think tank, serious folks looking at this. Here’s the bottom line. My plan lowers healthcare costs and gets universal coverage quickly at a time when Michigan families desperately are going to need that relief and they need it now. Families are reeling right now. They need a lifeline now. I promise you. When I’m president I’ll take care of your health coverage, the same way I would my own family.(20:29)
I grew up like a lot of people in this state. In Scranton, Pennsylvania and Wilmington, Delaware in a three bedroom, split level home with four kids and a grandpop living with us. I can remember how my dad, when we moved from Scranton for no work, we moved down to Delaware. He stayed with my grandpop for a year, he came home every weekend. Finally got a job. We got an apartment we lived in, and ended up being section eight housing years later, but it was decent. We were happy.(20:59)
It took my dad about three years to get a job good enough that he could actually buy a home. And he bought that small home at the time a suburban sprawl was going on. There were 70 homes like it, three and four bedrooms homes. But the walls were thin. I look back and I wonder how my mom and dad did it, come to think of it. I remember one night, my dad, you could hear him restlessly rolling in bed. Our bedroom was next to it. And I asked my mom the next morning, what’s wrong with Dad? She said, “Honey, it’s complicated.” I said, “What’s the matter, Mom?” I was 14 years old. She said, “Well, his company just lost his health insurance. We’re going to be okay, honey.”(21:42)
Think of all the people rolling around in bed tonight, tomorrow night, last night. Trump doesn’t see things this way because he only sees the world from a Park Avenue perspective. I’m not being a wise guy, I’m being literal. He can only see from his penthouse, Wall Street.(22:10)
I see the world from where I grew up like many of you. I grew up in Scranton, as I said. My mom taught me. My mom had a backbone like a ramrod. My mom taught me. She said, “Joey, look at me, look at me.” Because I used to stutter. She said, “Nobody’s better than you, Joey, but everybody’s your equal.” That’s how I was raised.(22:33)
I think you and I, we measure people, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, we measure people on the strength of their character. Honesty, decency, recognizing that some things are bigger than just your self-interest. That’s what America is about. That’s who we are. It’s about family, respect, decency, honor, opportunity. Our families and yours, we weren’t asking for anything. Just a shot, just an even shot. Given a shot, the American people have never, ever, ever, ever, ever let their country down.(23:13)
That’s what Michigan needs now, a shot to come back strong. That’s what you needed 10 years ago in your automobile industry, the heart and soul of Michigan was on the brink. My state used to be an auto state. Small population, we had the highest percentage of auto workers of any state in the nation because we had less than a million people. The largest General Motors and Chrysler plants outside of Michigan. But you all remember like I do. You remember what it was like yesterday.(23:52)
When Barack and I decided we had to bet on Michigan, remember all the blow back even from some Democrats. We can’t compete. We bet on auto workers, we bet on the UAW and they came through and it paid off. For real. The industry wasn’t in trouble because of the auto workers, it was in trouble because of management decisions. Over the objective of many, we stepped in and rescued the automobile industry, General Motors and Chrysler, saving over 1 million jobs by that one deal.(24:36)
Don’t ever underestimate the American worker. By contrast on Donald Trump’s watch, we were in a nationwide manufacturing recession before COVID struck. And we’re now down nearly 650,000 manufacturing jobs across the country now. Now, and it’s rising. In fact, Donald Trump will be the first president in modern American history to leave office, God willing, to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he started in office. Last one was Herbert Hoover. For real.(25:19)
Folks, we can bring this economy back. I’m positive of it. I’m optimistic about it. We know how to go about doing it. An independent analysis on Wall Street, Moody’s, a well-respected Wall Street firm, has done an in-depth analysis of every aspect of my plan, as well as his. You know what their conclusion was? This is Moody’s, now. That my plan will create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his would, and $1 trillion more in economic growth than the president’s plan, by investing in people.(26:09)
By the way, you see these ads here in Michigan, Biden’s going to raise your taxes. Once again, flat, unadulterated lie. No one who makes less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more. If you make more than that, you’re going to start paying at the rate you paid under the administration of George W. Bush at 39.6%. But I’m going to ask big corporations and the very wealthy to pay their fair share for a change. Trump’s more than $2 trillion tax cut, I’m going to roll back 1.5 trillion of that in the giveaways to the biggest companies in the top 1%. And the money we raise, we’ll invest in working people, in growing the middle class. And this time, make sure we bring everybody along, black, white, Hispanic-(27:03)
This time, make sure we bring everybody along. Black, white, Hispanic, disabled. Everyone comes along. Outside economists said my plan will create millions of good paying union jobs in manufacturing. We’re going to invest in building more resilient infrastructure. Remember the president said, “I have an infrastructure plan.” In 2017, and then 2018 and 2019, now 2020. He doesn’t have any plan. I’m going to build a resilient infrastructure, creating good paying jobs. Building roads and bridges and ports. One million new jobs and affordable housing units. Should be one million new affordable housing units. High-speed broadband for every household. A 100 billion dollars to rebuild our crumbling schools. One of the reasons we can’t send our kids back to schools. A lot of them aren’t even safe now.(28:03)
We’re going to retrofit as we started our administration when the president allowed me to run the recovery act. We’re going to retrofit four million buildings and weatherize two billion homes. That alone will save 100s of thousands of millions of barrels of oil. It’s all going to be done by certified union labor. I’m going to end Trump’s incentives. He talks about his trade deals. As Gary and Debbie know in his trade deals he incentivized people to send jobs abroad.(28:47)
Abroad. More taking their jobs overseas. One thing more the United States Government owns and maintains enormous fleet of vehicles. I promise you, the president controls that. I’m going to convert those government fleets into clean vehicles made of and sourced right here in the United States of America. I’m going to expand the capacity so the United States, not China leads the world in clean vehicle production.(29:17)
We’re going to make it easier to America’s companies to switch from fuel inefficient vehicles. We’re going to build a network of 500,000 charging stations all across the country. Offer consumer rebates to swap old or fuel inefficient vehicles for new clean American made models. Together, this will mean according to the estimates, more than a million good new jobs in the American auto release, because we will own the electric vehicle market in the world.(29:48)
Folks I guarantee you, we can do this, but we have to come together. I remember you and I talking gov when I was running for the nomination in my same way to unite the country. You’re the only one whp thought I was right. That used to be the old days. Yeah, Joe, you got a lot done. You used to walk across to get a lot done, but everything’s changed. Well folks, if we can’t unite the country, we’re in trouble.(30:23)
America and our system runs on consensus. Compromise is not a dirty word. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. I do not see American terms of red and blue. Bringing the country together, that’s the job of a president. It’s a duty to care. To care for everybody. We can be so much better than what we see.(31:04)
We can be what you are at our best, when we’re the United States of America. Folks, you have to vote and people are turning out here in this state and overwhelming numbers around the country. If you have any doubt, go visit iwillvote.com/and-i. Early voting is happening now. Every city and township clerk’s office in the state. You can register to vote in one quick stop. You have your ballot already, mail it or drop it in a Dropbox today.(31:47)
Don’t wait, vote, and don’t just vote for me and Senator Harris and Gary as well. Vote all the way down the line. We’re going to need Gary back in the United States Senate, looking out for Michigan families because we’re going to win back the United States Senate. When we do, we’re going to change things. Folks, this time I really mean this to restore the soul of America. To rebuild the backbone of this country, the middle class.(32:23)
This time is I’d bring everybody along. Debbie, may remember my colleagues in the caucus used to wonder kid me because I quote President Kennedy. When he was about going to the moon and famous speech, everybody remembers the different parts of it. The line I remember more than anything else. He answered the question that wasn’t, it was implicitly being asked, “Why are you doing this?” He said, “Because we’d refused to postpone. I refuse to postpone the work America must do now to bring this country back.”(33:01)
There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to American future. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. No other country can do that. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Well, we have to let them know who we are. What we stand for, we choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies. Folks thank you and may God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

I just have one thing to say. Hang on there. (00:38)
[crosstalk 00:00:38] I tell you what. If I had the talent of any one of these people, I’d be elected president by acclamation. Thank you so much. (00:51)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hello and Happy Hispanic Heritage month. It’s great to be back in Florida and to be here to celebrate what is best in our democracy, our diversity. Our culture that is shaped by people from every part of the world, especially the rich, Hispanic heritage that enliven so much of our national story. We hear it in the rhythms that pour into our hearts and move our feet. To artists like [Louis 00:01:23] and Ricky, thank you both. Thank you both for being here, but more than being here, but thank you for actually jumping in and trying to help me win this election. It is, where I come from, they call that a big deal. It really is. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.(01:40)
We see it represented in our television and our movie screens with actresses like Eva Longoria. Thank you, Eva, for both joining us tonight, for the outstanding work you did in hosting the first night of the democratic convention. You have changed political conventions forever. I don’t think we’ll ever see one like the old-fashioned conventions. You did an incredible job. You’ve become a great friend, and thank you, thank you, thank you for sticking with me. We recognize in the halls of power, and our Congress, and our leaders, and like my friend, Representative Darren Soto, who I had the pleasure of speaking with a few minutes ago. I have thanked him for the passport into his district. I appreciate it. Congressman, thank you for all you do for the people in this district.(02:25)
It’s in the scientists working in labs across the country on vaccines to fight this virus, and the doctors and the nurses in the front lines, working around the clock to care for people’s health. It’s in the diplomats who proudly represent the United States of America and our values in countries all over the world, and on our military members and the families who love this country so much, they’re willing to sacrifice everything for it. It’s in engineers who are working to develop new technology that’s going to help us grasp our clean energy future. And in the skilled union craftsmen who are going to build it. Hispanic Heritage month is an important reminder of just how much strength we draw as a nation from our immigrant roots and our values as a nation of immigrants. Unless you are a Native American or your ancestors were enslaved and brought here by force beginning 400 years ago, we’ve all come from somewhere else.(03:25)
For most of us, that journey began with a choice, to try for something better here in the United States, whether it’s my ancestors who boarded coffin ships in the Irish sea, in the famine in the 1840s, or families that fled oppressive regimes, and natural disasters in Latin American and the Caribbean, or any of the waves of immigrants seeking freedom and opportunity who have continually renewed our strength and have given us the important capacity to all of us to speak, to speak with grit and determination, to simply say, “I can do it. I can do it.” All of our ancestors, yours and mine, they came equipped with only one thing. The only thing they had in their pocket was hope. In so many ways, that’s part of what makes us Americans. And for people with Hispanic ancestries, those contributions date all the way back before our founding. There’s no separating out Hispanic heritage from American heritage.(04:28)
These stories are one and the same, and growing more vibrantly entwined every single day. Today, it is no exaggeration to say that the future of the success of this country depends on, depends on Hispanics having opportunities and the tools they need to succeed. I know my team here knows, my new team, that 24 of every 100 kids in school today speaks Spanish. The idea, the idea we are not going to encourage and build and invest in is just mindblowingly stupid. Folks, in the midst of this God-awful pandemic, we’ve seen even more clearly than ever how much we rely on people with Hispanic roots to keep our country running. Again, that’s not an exaggeration. So many of our frontline workers are Hispanic. The people stocking the grocery shelves, driving the delivery trucks, working in the meat packing plants, staffing our nursing homes, our hospitals. These include 200,000 dreamers working in those key roles, many of whom are of Hispanic heritage.(05:39)
We depend on them. A lot of people who are recognized for the first time by what they truly are, essential. What we do, we don’t just need to thank them. We need to pay them, pay them, and treat them with dignity. My dad used to say, “Joe, your job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.'” And to make sure we’re giving Hispanic Americans the support and respect they deserve and need at all times, we have to change our attitudes. How can we have a strong and thriving republic if we aren’t doing more to fully deal in Hispanic communities? And all those communities have, for too long, been left out and left behind to every aspect of American life.(06:30)
The answer is real simple. We won’t be able to. That’s why I’ve laid out extensive plans that demonstrate how we’re going to use every tool at our disposal to take on the inequities that hurt Hispanic communities by, number one, investing in economic mobility, improving our educational system, rooting out race-based disparities in our healthcare, and building out Obamacare, taking on the gun violence that plagues our communities, and finally, building an immigration system that treats people with dignity and is true to American values. Today, I released my agenda for Puerto Rico. Even after being president for nearly four years, Donald Trump doesn’t seem to grasp that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens already. When you think about it, they deserve to have a leadership in government that understands that in America, there is no room for the idea of second class citizens, period.(07:35)
We’re all equal. All deserving. I’m running to be president of all America, including 3 million American citizens living in Puerto Rico. I’m not going to steal the money that’s desperately needed to reconstruct the island in order to build a wall along the border that does nothing to keep Americans safe. I’m not going to suggest that we sell our trade, as was mentioned earlier, Puerto Rico. I’m not going to throw paper towels at people whose lives have just been devastated by hurricane. The world saw that, not just the United… The world saw that. It was mortifying. I’m not going to deny the science of climate change that tells us hurricanes are devastating weather events that will only grow more frequent and more intense unless we take action. I’m certainly not going to say what the president allegedly said to the department of Homeland Security and the National Security officials when he allegedly said, “I got it. I got it. The way to keep these hurricanes from coming on board is nuke them.”(08:39)
Whoa, nuke them. I’m going to lead. I’m going to respect and support the islands we know and fully recovery, including investing in infrastructure, reconstruction to modernize standards, promote economic development initiatives to support for families, provide relief for the unsustainable debt that exists on the island, and expand access to education and workforce development. I’m going to work with representatives to support each of the status options in Puerto Rico on a fair and binding process to determine their own status. I happen to believe statehood to be the most effective means of ensuring that residents of Puerto Rico are treated equally with equal representation at a federal level. But the people of Puerto Rico must decide, and the United States federal government must respect and act on that decision.(09:35)
This much is certain. A Biden-Harrison administration will always have the back of every single American when they get knocked down. I’ve been knocked down, and many of you have too. I know what it’s like. But my dad would say, “Every time you get knocked down, just get up, Joey. Get up.” We’re going to get up. We’re going to honor the incredible contributions and service of Puerto Ricans. People from all across the Hispanic diaspora to this country, to this country, not only the names we know and like, like Emmanuel Miranda, who was helping me out. But remember the stories that don’t always make the headlines like Puerto Rico’s 65th infantry regiment, who General MacArthur described as, “Writing a brilliant record of heroism in battle during the Korean war.” How much did you all hear about that?(10:28)
We’ll work to build on Obamacare and expand its protections so that more Hispanic people have access to high quality affordable healthcare that they deserve. Under the Obama-Biden administration, 4 million Hispanic Americans gained coverage. The largest gain of coverage of any group. But President Trump is still, still trying to rip Obamacare away from people in the middle of the worst pandemic in a century. That’s on top of the total failure to manage COVID-19, which has now stolen, stolen the lives of almost 200,000 people in America, with disproportionately large share of those deaths among Hispanic communities. Over 25,000 deaths. That’s on top of the failure to adequately work to address the economic impacts of this pandemic, which again, have fallen more heavily on Hispanic pocketbooks. More than 25% of Hispanics here in Florida have reported being worried about how they’re going to pay their rent or their mortgage. A study found that one in three Hispanic small business owners have taken a hit during this pandemic with many more likely to close and close permanently. That’s on top of his failure, and, in fact, the complete disinterest in addressing the racial injustice crisis in America.(11:49)
He does exactly the opposite. He fans the flames of hatred and division in our country for his own gain. That’s on top of his failure to recognize the existential threat of climate crisis. Yesterday in California, he said, sitting with a group of scientists, “I don’t think science knows whether or not climate change is real.” That’s what he said, at a time on wildfires are racing across the West destroying homes and communities and another hurricane threatens our coast. Mr. President, science knows. Science knows. They do know. Look, Donald Trump has failed the Hispanic community time and time again, and that’s not a secret. Whether it’s in his heinous act of separating children from their families at our border or his repeated attacks on dreamers, or his neglect of the people of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, or his repeated failure to make sure essential workers have the personal protective equipment they need.(12:53)
Donald Trump has done nothing but assault the dignity of Hispanic families over and over, and over, and over again. It’s wrong. That’s not who we are. We have to do so much more than just defeat Donald Trump. We have to seize this opportunity to build back better for all of our communities because at the end of the day, all the American people are looking for is a shot. My dad would say, “The American people just given half a chance of never ever, ever, ever, ever let the country down, chance to work hard and get ahead.” But you can’t do it when your community is always the first and hardest hit and the last to get help instead of when they needed to dig out. I truly believe we have a tremendous opportunity to turn this moment of crisis in a moment of progress on healthcare, wages, housing, education, and so much more.(13:52)
We can reach for more as a nation. We can rebuild the backbone of this country and finally bring everybody along. We can build a new administration that reflects the full diversity of our nation, including Hispanic communities. Hispanic voters, especially right here in Florida, can help put our nation on a path moving forward. There are now 49 days left to election day. I’m asking for your vote. I’m going to work very hard every single day to get it. I used to, when I first ran as a kid, I’d knock on a door and say, “My name is Joe Biden. I’m running for the United States Senate. Look me over. If you like what I see and believe what I say, help me out. If not, vote for the other guy.” Well, I’m here in Florida to say, “Look me over again.” Here in Florida and all across the country, I hope that each and every one of you gets involved in this selection. Sounds like hyperbole, exaggeration, but our democracy depends on every voice being heard and every vote being counted.(14:57)
So, please, this election, make your vote hurt. Through your vote, your voice is heard. Make a plan to vote has been pointed out. Make a plan to help your community vote. I grew up in a heavily Irish Catholic community in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in a heavily Italian Polish community in Claymont, Delaware. These are communities built on two things: faith and family. They’ve been the core of my entire life. That’s what I come back to again and again, whether it’s losing my wife and daughter in an accident or my son dying from glioblastoma. It’s been the source of my strength in times of struggle and my comfort in times of grief: faith, and family. It seems to me, that’s the same strength that’s always animated the Hispanic community: faith and family. That’s the heritage we’re celebrating this month, and it’s profoundly American as well. It’s not only our past, it’s our future as well.(16:03)
And more than any other time, the Hispanic community, Latino community holds in their palm of their hand, the destiny of this country. You may not want to hear it, but it’s true. It’s true. You can decide the direction of this country. I’ve said many times when I decided to run, I said, “One of the reasons why I’m running is to restore the soul of America.” It’s a basic proposition. We’re so much better than we are acting now. The rest of the world is looking at us like, what has happened to America? America’s always led not just by the example of our power, but the power of our example.(16:51)
We hold these truths to be self evident. All men and women are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. And it goes on. We’ve never met that test. We’ve never walked away from it before. We got to keep bending that arc. we got to keep getting more inclusive because therein lies the power and the majesty of the United States of America. I want to thank you all, particularly thank the people who came here and introduced me today. And may God protect our troops. God bless you all. Thank you."
biden_speech_iowa.txt,"(15:36)
Hello, Iowa. Hello, Polk County. Hello, De Moines. Back at the state fair. God love you all. Thank you for being out here today. Folks, I want to thank Ross. Thanks for that introduction. Ross, my heart goes out to you. It really is. I know it’s hard, but you’ve been turning loss into purpose, saving lives. People who in fact ask me about my circumstances in the past said the best way to get through it is with purpose, find purpose. And you’ve done that. And Governor Tom and Christie Vilsack, my best buddies. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’ve done for me before, now, and God willing after. Jill and I will always be grateful, grateful for your support and your friendship. And folks, Cindy Axly, God loved her. And Amy Finkenhower, Abby Finkenhower.(17:08)
I tell you what, you guys are the single best Congress persons I’ve campaigned with. You need leaders like you right now. We need more of you. We need more. We’ve got to elect them both. And by the way, we need Readon in the Second District and J.D. in the Fourth District. It’s time we can change things a little bit here. Right? Time to change it. I tell you what, and how about Theresa? I’ll tell you what, you have no idea how much you’re going to make my night when you win. You have no idea. And how you’re going to make everybody else’s night. You are as they say back in Scranton, you’re the real deal, kid. You’re the real deal. And you’ve never forgotten where you came from. And the I’m confident about is even going to Washington as a U.S. Senator, you’re not going to forget where you came from and who you are.(18:05)
Your values are baked in. They’re Iowa values. They’re American values. You value honor, decency, respect, and dignity. You know they all matter. They matter a lot. That’s who we are. And as we saw in the debate, where a farmer’s daughter knows a breakeven point for a price of corn, crops. You think that’d be fairly basic. That’s like my not knowing where the Delaware River was back home. Folks, but there’s something else. Theresa and I both lost our first spouses. We’ve both been single parents with young kids. We both found a way back from broken places. And we know that’s why you should elect this woman, Theresa, to the United States Senate. She sees, she understands, she believes. When she talks to you, when you talk to her, you know, and I’m not just saying this, you know she understands, she gets it.(19:14)
Just like our good friend Tom Harkin was your Senator. Teresa will be your Senator for Iowa. Not like her opponent, who’s Donald Trump’s Senator for Donald Trump. Folks, only four days left. Millions of Americans are already voting. Millions more are going to vote by late Tuesday night. I believe, when you use your power, the power of a vote, we’re going to change the course of the country and quite frankly the world. Right here in Iowa with all of you in the final days. Please keep your sense of empowerment. Keep your sense of optimism of what we can do together, because you know we can do anything. You know how I know how hard it is. More than 200, and now I think it’s up to 30,000 people have died, Americans dead, because COVID-19.(20:21)
Nearly 1,700 dead right here in Iowa. Iowa hit a record number of daily cases yesterday. It was over 2,300, and a record number of hospitalizations, more than 600. We’ve now hit nine million cases nationwide, a tragic milestone. And millions of people are out of work, on the edge, and they can’t see the light. They don’t know. It just looks dark right now for them. 82,000 Iowa jobs lost in this pandemic and still they’ve not come back. 70,000 jobs lost in Iowa since Donald Trump became President. Here at the fairgrounds, the Iowa State Fair canceled for the first time since World War Two, and Donald Trump has given up. The White House Chief of Staff said it out loud last week. He said, “We’re not going to control the pandemic. We’re not going to control the pandemic.” In the debate last week with Donald Trump, he said, “We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away.” And only he could say, “We’re learning to live with it.” Well, maybe you remember what I told him, “We’re not learning to live with it. We’re having to learn to die with it because of you.” Donald Trump has waved the white flag. He surrendered to this virus. But the American people don’t give up. Remember what he said when he did that interview, he said, although he knew about the crisis, he knew how bad it was back in January, the end of January, he decided not to tell the people, because he worried there would panic. Well, guess what? We don’t panic. He panicked. And he misrepresented to us. Imagine if you had told us in January how dangerous this was and took action. It’s estimated there would be over 130,000 people still alive.(22:38)
By the way, we don’t cower. Nor do I and never will we. Unlike Donald Trump, we will not surrender to this virus. I’m going to put in place a plan to deal with this pandemic responsibly, which I laid out back in March, bringing the country together around testing, tracing, masking. It’s estimated by the leading doctors in America that if you just wore those masks for the next between now and the end of the year, we would save, just putting this mask on, we’d saved 100,000 lives. It’s expected that 200,000 more lives will pass between having the end of the year. Dr. Fauci called last week for a mask mandate. This isn’t a political statement. It’s patriotic duty, for God’s sake. But still, Donald Trump refuses to listen to science. He politicizes the race for a vaccine instead of planning for its safe and equitable and free distribution. He refused to provide schools and small businesses the resources and national standards where they can open safely and stay open. Well, I’m going to bring together Republicans and Democrats to deliver economic relief to working families and school …(24:03)
… together Republicans and Democrats to deliver economic relief to working families and schools and businesses. The Congress has already passed this legislation. It’s sitting there, but he refused, he spent all his time this summer in his golf course bunkers or down in the white house bunkers, think about it. I’ve been around for a while, I bet even Senator Grassley would have to acknowledge that I don’t ever remember any President in a crisis where there’s a disagreement in the house and the Senate between Democrats and Republicans, didn’t even try to bring them together to deal with this. The house back in May passed the Heroes Act, which would allow businesses and schools to open safely because it costs money, you need sanitation, you need ventilation, you need masking, you need distancing, you need separators. It all costs money, but it’s sad, one in six businesses are now out of business, because he won’t act. I’ve said before, I’m not going to shut down the economy, I’m going to shut down the virus.(25:19)
Even before the virus Donald Trump had already blown it, he inherited a strong economy from Barack and me, well like everything else he inherited, he squandered it. He squandered it, frankly. I’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life, so have you. Guys who think because they have a lot more money that they’re better than you, look down on you. I know, I acknowledge I got a little bit of a chip on my shoulder coming from an Irish Catholic neighborhood where it wasn’t viewed as that being such a great thing. When I read something about how if I’m elected President, I’m going to be the first non-Ivy league person to occupy the white house in a long time. Well guess what? Like somehow, I didn’t belong if I didn’t go to the Ivy league. Look, I’ll say it about time, it’s about time that a guy or woman or graduate from a state university is able to sit in the oval office.(26:35)
Because if I’m sitting there, you will be too, you know who really built this country? It wasn’t Wall Street, it wasn’t CEO’s, it was hard working folks like all of you who built the middle class and unions helped build the middle class. We know how we can build a back and build it back better with an economy that rewards work for a change, not wealth. We can do it without raising the penny tax on the middle class. I guarantee you, give you my word as a Biden no one making less than $400,000 year will see a penny in their taxes raised, no one, but I tell you what, it’s about time. The wealthiest people in America, the billionaires, the trillionaires, the multi-billionaires and the biggest corporations start paying their fair share. 91 major corporations out of the Fortune 500 didn’t pay a penny in tax last year, that’s tens of billions of dollars. They’re going to pay their fair share.(27:47)
Why should a firefighter, an educator, a nurse, a cop pay a higher tax rate, which you do than a major multi-billion dollar corporation. Why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump who paid $750? You want to know everything I don’t like about Trump? Let me tell you, I could capture it in one answer he gave. He was asked last time out about paying so little taxes, allegedly being a billionaire, know what he said? He says, “Because I’m smarter, I know how to game the system.” But he ain’t going to be gaming the system anymore in the Biden administration, they’re going to start paying. And we’re going to deliver tax relief for working families, the middle class to help you buy your first home, pay for healthcare premiums or childcare or care for an aging loved one, or being able to pay off your student debt for God’s sake. Look, where I come from it’s just about being fair. We’re not asking anybody to do any more than anybody else just be fair, decent.(29:07)
Trump got a Supreme Court Justice for overwhelming reason, by the way, never before has there ever been a hearing on a Supreme Court Justice once an election began. That’s never occurred, but you got his justice for one simple reason to destroy the Affordable Care Act. He’d been trying since the day he got elected, and if they get their way, $100 million people will lose protection for pre-existing conditions, including 1.3 million Iowans will lose it. Complications of COVID-19 are going to become the next preexisting condition. Allowing insurers to jack up your premiums, delay your coverage and a lot of young people don’t realize this, but before Obamacare insurance companies charged women more for the same healthcare they charge men because they could, that’ll end. Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege, I think it’s a right. We all get out and vote. And by the way, they’re going to court in 10 days, 10 days, as he said to wipe it all out, end it, all of it.(30:34)
Well, I’ll restore the Affordable Care Act and I’ll strengthen and build on it, so you can keep your private insurance if you like it, or choose a Medicare like public option. We’re going to increase subsidies for lower premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses, surprise billing. As Theresa said, this time, we are going to make sure Medicare can negotiate with the drug companies for prices reducing them by 60%. I promise you we’ll get that done. We’re going to make sure we keep protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Remember what he said when he talked about the people who were dying and not dying, he said, “Virtually,” this is a quote from Trump, “virtually nobody’s dying, except for people over 65 with heart conditions,” like they’re disposable. It doesn’t matter with this guy. No, I’m not joking. Think about it, think about it. And then when he was told for the first time like we did today, 1,000 deaths a day, remember what his comment was? He said, “It is what it is.” Well it is what it is because he is who he is, that’s why it is what it is. These guys are something else, man. And meanwhile, the actuary at the Social Security Department says if Donald Trump gets what he’s saying, he said, “You reelect me I’m going to change social security.” The actuary says, “If the change occurs that he is promoting, it will bankrupt social security by 2023.” Go home and tell your parents or grandparents that, that’s a fact. Theresa said I’ll protect social, security, Medicare, Medicaid. And let’s not forget how Donald Trump weak and chaotic China trade policy has cost farmers and manufacturing so badly. Agricultural exports to China during the Trump years have been 40% lower than during the Obama Biden second term. On his watch and this really bugs me, on his watch ethanol margins have tanked and Iowa’s manufacturing facilities are idle and even closing. He even says, I love this quote from him. He says, because of his bailouts, “Our farmers do better now than when they actually had a farm.” I’m going to read that again. “Our farmers are actually doing better now than when they actually had a farm.” Where’s this guy from? Who does he think he is?(33:41)
Look, I’ll do what he’s been unable to do, I’ll mobilize a true international effort to stop China’s abuses so we can strengthen manufacturing and farming in Iowa and across the country. I’m going to hold China accountable, which he hasn’t from the pandemic on. Folks. But there’s nothing worse in my view than the way he has spoken about those who served in uniform. He called them losers and suckers. My son, Beau, many of you knew volunteered to serve a year in Iraq, gave up the Attorney General’s job to do it. Won the bronze star, the Conspicuous Service Metal and other awards, he was neither a loser or a sucker, he was a Patriot. And Theresa, so is your son Dane, who was in the army, he’s a Patriot like all of your sons, daughters, and all of those of you who have served.(34:59)
It’s no wonder that the six top generals in the President’s administration left and said, “He does not deserve to be commander in chief,” his own generals in his own administration. No President has ever had that happen, none. And that’s why Special Forces Commander, Stanley McChrystal, general and the head of the Navy Seals, Admiral Craven, along with 20 other four star generals endorsed me saying they’d be proud to have me as commander in chief. A sitting President. And that’s why the Military Times quotes more troops would vote for Biden then Trump. Folks, it’s not about me, it’s about him. That’s why we have to support our military. You vote for me, you’re voting for them. And while Donald Trump fails to condemn White supremacy …(36:03)
And while Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy, we can vote to deliver racial justice. A season of protest has broken out all across America. And by the way, legitimate protesting is not burning or looting. Violence can never be tolerated and it won’t. But those protests are cries for justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake. They’ll not soon be forgotten, not by me, not by us, or not by this country.(36:38)
Folks, we ave to vote to meet the challenge of climate crisis as well. More frequent, extreme weather. The West is on fire. We’ve lost more forest than the total space of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined, in the West. The Midwest I need not tell you is flooding. You know here in Iowa, the derecho, catastrophic floods and droughts that lay waste to lives, livelihoods and whole communities. And in the South and the East hurricanes are more severe. Oceans are rising. My state’s only three feet above sea level. People are already talking about the change we have to make. We don’t have a lot of time. Donald Trump, when you say climate change, he thinks hoax, and that stable genius, as he calls himself, continues to say wind power causes cancer. It’s the same guy who said, by the way you think I’m making this up, when he was advised about the increasing hurricanes coming across the Atlantic because of the warm water, he said, “Maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them.” Holy mackerel.(37:56)
This also a guy you may recall, the stable genius, he said, “The problem with the revolutionary war was we didn’t have enough airports.” And he talks about mental acuity? Whoa. Folks, you look at climate warming. You look at it the way I do. Creates jobs, Iowa jobs, jobs across America. You understand that here in Iowa we’ve already created thousands of good paying jobs because of your dominant in wind energy. And it’s expected that the number of wind jobs will double or triple by 2030 in Iowa. And notwithstanding that the stable genius says wind power causes cancer. Wind power helps save the planet, generates millions of dollars in economic growth, and provides good prevailing wage jobs.(38:54)
Folks, combating climate change means saving the planet, protecting our health, and creating millions of good paying jobs, Union jobs, in wind and solar and carbon capture. Iowa farmers were the first in the world to be in a position where they reach net zero emissions, because we’re going to make sure there’s a whole lot more land set aside and you get paid for it. Deep rooted products, emissions, reward them. Folks, we can do this. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. So honk if you want America to lead again. Honk if you want America to trust each other again. Honk if you want America to be united again.(39:49)
Folks, we cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump. In 2008 and 2012 you placed your trust in Barack Obama and me and we worked for you, for the entire country. Well, I’ll do it again in 2020. My campaign is a broad coalition, welcomes Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. In my administration, they’ll be no red states or blue states, just the United States of America.(40:36)
Folks, I mean this at the bottom of my heart. That’s the job of a president, a duty to care, to care for everyone, to heal. And you too have a sacred duty, a duty to vote. It matters. Iowa matters. So in these final days stay empowered, stay united, stay optimistic. Make a plan to vote, vote early, vote on election day, help get out the vote. Go to I willvote.com/ia.(41:16)
Folks, this president has done everything to try to discourage us, to try to convince us that it doesn’t matter, all about illegal voting, all the stuff he’s putting up, but guess what? He will not be able to stop us at all. Despite Trump’s efforts, a recent press article two days ago said never before “in modern presidential politics has a candidate had been so reliant on wide-scale efforts to repress the vote as Trump.” End of quote. We will not be silenced. 85 million people have already voted so far. We’ve had enough.(42:13)
Folks, look, I’ll never forget as a kid, the words of President Kennedy about going to the moon. He used the phrase, he said, we’re doing it because, ” We refuse to postpone, or I refuse to postpone, incredible opportunities available to the American people.” There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There is no limit to our future. The only thing that can’t tear America, look, I’ll talk about how we’re in trouble. Well, nothing can tear America part, except America itself. And that’s exactly what Donald Trump is doing from the beginning. Trying to divide America, pitting Americans against one another based on race, gender, ethnicity, national origin. It’s wrong. That’s not who we are.(43:13)
Look, folks, everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We got to let him know who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division, science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lies. So folks, it’s time for us to stand up, take back our democracy. We can do this. We’re so much better than we’ve been. We can be who we are at our best, the United States of America. There’s literally not a thing we’ve ever been unable to do, nothing. The only country in the world that’s ever come out of every crisis stronger than it went in is United States of America. And with your help, I promise you, that’s what we’ll do again. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.(44:29)
Thank you."
biden_speech_jobs.txt,"(01:12)
Good morning. Today we learned the latest job numbers. Like every American I’m happy that millions of American workers are back on payrolls and this historic unemployment we still face has at least come down a bit more. This is a good day for every one of those individuals and their families who regained their security. But as happy as I was for millions of workers returning to their jobs, there is one number that I was stunned that the president didn’t mention even once in the process and the entire time he talked about it, the number was 50,000. Yesterday the number of new COVID-19 cases in America topped 50,000 in a single day. We’ve never hit that number before in the course of this virus. In 45 states, the seven day average of infections are higher than they were a week ago. In some places, hospital ICUs are at the near capacity, near breaking point. And we’re still seeing all across the country spikes in the virus that are causing many states to impose new restrictions again.(02:20)
To me and to many Americans this is very worrisome turn in the path and severity of the virus and the president didn’t even address it. Yesterday he reiterated his belief that the virus was going to disappear. Today he described what was happening as fires, quote, fires flaring up in the country. That’s just not an honest assessment of what’s happening. And it’s not just me saying that, the rest of the world knows that as well. Just this week, 27 European countries have banned Americans from traveling there because of the surging number of COVID-19 cases in the United States. The European Union says, “Don’t come.” They’re coming from a dangerous place for the virus.(03:08)
Until this president faces what’s going on in our country, our economy is going to remain at risk. Today’s report is positive news, and I’m thankful for it, for real, but make no mistake we’re still on a deep, deep job hole because Donald Trump has so badly bungled the response to coronavirus and now has basically given up on responding at all. You know a million more Americans would, millions of them would still have their job if Donald Trump had done his job and many of the jobs that have now come back should never have been lost in the first place. And for everyone whose job hasn’t come back, for everyone who doesn’t own stock, who can’t get the sweetheart loan through connections, does this feel like a victory? For parents are worried their kids can’t go back to school in the fall, do you feel like this is mission accomplished? Or for the people in states where COVID-19 is spiking and we’re seeing record high numbers of infections, do you feel like this crisis is under control? Of course not.(04:14)
People are scared. They’re worried about their families and about their future, but just like last month, President Trump has spiked the ball and made this about him. He doesn’t seem to realize he’s not even on the 50 yard line. Only one third of the jobs that were lost in March and April have now come back. Most of those jobs that returned were people on temporary furlough. That means these were the easiest jobs to get back as we reopen cities and states. It’s only going to get harder from here though. Permanent job lost numbers actually went up 588,000, almost 3 million permanently lost jobs.(05:00)
President Trump touted the job gains for African American workers, but unemployment for black men actually rose from 15.5% to 16.3% in June. He touted the numbers for Latino unemployment, but those numbers are still more than three times higher than they were before the crisis started. Look, let’s not lose sight of the critical point. This report measures job gains as of June the 12th, in the days since we’ve seen cases spiking around the country, some businesses closed down again, some states reimposing restrictions. And in the last two weeks, we’ve seen almost 3 million new unemployment filings and another 1.7 million people seeking pandemic unemployment insurance. There’s no victory to be celebrated. We should hope, but there’s no victory celebrate it.(05:57)
We’re still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse, not better. And it doesn’t have to. Millions of Americans are still out of work wondering when or if their job will come back or worried about how to pay the bills in the meantime. Trump wants to declare his health crisis over and unemployment solved. Unfortunately, he’s deadly wrong on both fronts. We’ve already at more than 128,000 dead. The number keeps climbing. That’s a direct consequence of Donald Trump’s bungled leadership and a total mismanagement of this crisis from the start. His failure to take quick action made this pandemic more costly for American people in every way, in lives lost, in economic impact and economic toll of those living with so much doubt and uncertainty.(06:49)
Now, as I said on Tuesday, he surrendered to this virus. Other countries have figured out how to get the virus under control and reopened their economies and put their people safely back to work. Other leaders didn’t waste time they were given from the start for stay at home orders. They got to work solving the root causes of this crisis, the coronavirus. Donald Trump just had given up. He’s not even trying to secure the public health anymore. He’d rather go back to the campaign rallies. He’s not interested in uniting us in this fight of a common threat we face. He’s decided he’s more, has more to gain by dividing this country for his own political purposes.(07:31)
Without a uniform plan and guidance from the federal government that state and local leaders can use to inform their reopening plans this is going to continue to be worse than it would have been otherwise. Recovery will be slower. Unemployment will stay higher than it should be. Has he even once expressed any real empathy for the families who’ve never again be whole because of this virus? Has he done anything, anything real to prioritize support for working Americans who need help now? Now.(08:06)
Democrats in Congress have put forward legislation to reward and protect our brave frontline workers. Helping working families find childcare, extend the supplemental unemployment benefits for people for the duration of the economic crisis. Meanwhile, the Republicans and President Trump are stalling on support for working families, even as they dole out taxpayer money to big corporations with zero accountability. Has Donald Trump even acknowledged the disproportionate impact this disease is having on black, brown and Native American communities, much less done anything to address those health disparities or underlying systemic racism has shapes them? You know the answer. Of course not.(08:52)
That’d require him to step up and lead. It would require him to put the American people ahead of his own interest. Didn’t have to be like this. America has more reported deaths and infections than anywhere else in the world. Our healthcare workers were still rationing personal protective equipment. They still don’t have sufficient testing to allow people to return to work with confidence. President Trump has turned wearing a mask into a political statement. And yesterday, yesterday he was once more claiming the coronavirus would quote, just disappear, I hope. Quote, just disappear I hope. That’s what he said. It’s like deja vu all over again. We’re months into this crisis and that’s still his best answer. Quit hoping for the best Mr. President. Quit claiming victory with almost 15 million un-Americans still out of work because of the crisis. Quit ignoring the reality this pandemic and the horrifying loss of American life. Act. Lead. Lead. Or get out of the way so others can Mr. President.(10:12)
God bless you all and may He protect you and may God protect our troops. Thank you."

… a widow and a dear friend of an American hero, John McCain. We also saw the resilience and the goodness of decency of the American people. They’re not looking for a handout, they just want a fair shot. My dad used to have an expression when he lost his job up in Scranton. When I was in grade school, my dad would say, and we had to move in with my grandparents. When he went down south from Scranton to Wilmington, Delaware looking for a job. And he used to always say that, “The fact is Joey, I’m not looking for government to solve my problems but I hope like hell they can at least understand my problems.” He finally got a job, we could afford to buy a small home. He worked hard to build a decent middle class life. It wasn’t easy for him, but he had an expression.(00:47)
As I said, a job joy about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s being uable to look your kidney eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.” You deserve a president who understands what you’re going through. Who sees you where you are and where you want to be. The last thing you need is a president who ignores you, looks down upon you, who just doesn’t understand who in God’s name we are. That’s President Trump. His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis. The destabilizing effect it’s having on our government is unconscionable. He didn’t take the necessary precautions to protect himself or others. And the longer Donald Trump is President, the more reckless he gets. How can we trust him to protect this country?(01:44)
Governor, you’ve seen how he picks fights with states and pits them against one another. Look, what’s happened. More than 210,000 Americans are dead. 420,000 have been hospitalized. We lose anywhere from 700 to a thousand people every single day in America, worse than any country in the world. More than 7.5 million Americans have been infected. And we’re still counting. And here in Nevada, there have been more than 82,000 cases in total. More than 1,600 deaths. 80% of those deaths have been seniors over 60 years of age. Black, Latino, Asian American, Native-American communities are especially hit hard. Nationally, the infection rate among Latinos is almost three times higher than that of white non-Latinos and the death rate as well as three times higher. More than 40,000 Latinos have died from COVID-19. My heart goes out to all those families who got up this morning and there was an empty chair around the kitchen table. Or go to dinner tonight and the person that should be there is gone.(03:08)
They’ve lost part of their soul. They’ve lost part of their life. It’s all about family. With you and I it’s all about family. Losing family is a devastating thing. We can do so much better. My heart goes out to everyone struggling with the economic crisis caused by the neglect, the simple neglect of this President. Nearly 11 million jobs lost since the beginning of this crisis. And they still haven’t come back, including 136,000 jobs here in Nevada. Temporary layoffs have turned to permanent layoffs. Record growth last month and a number of Americans facing long-term unemployment. And the problem of long-term unemployment, once you get beyond a certain point, history shows us that they never get a job again.(04:04)
All told, there are now 30 million workers who either lost hours, lost paychecks, or lost their jobs entirely. Roughly 700,000 people have dropped out of the labor force last month. And the vast majority were women. We’re still down 647,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis has started. And our balance of payments deficit is going up. And here in Nevada, the unemployment rate is 13.2%, the highest in the nation because of President Trump’s negligence. The hospitality industry has hit particularly hard. The culinary union, has recently said publicly that 50% of their members are still out of work. Tourism in June was down 70% from a year ago. The result? President Trump will be the first president in modern history since Hoover to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he came into office. Here in Nevada, after seeing over 200,000 jobs created in the last seven years of the Obama-Biden administration, Nevada has actually seen jobs go down under the Trump presidency. He’s leaving us with what he calls, he says is a V-shape recession.(05:36)
It’s a K-shaped recession where those at the top keep going up and the middle-class and everyone else keeps going down, getting worse. Means essential workers who sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern history. You get this, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just in the pandemic, the top 100 billionaires have made an additional $300 billion, top 100. But you get the bottom half of that K and it’s a downward slide. You’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay your bills, put food on the table. So much food insecurity in America, in this state. How to balance doing your job with being a teacher for your kids because of the negligence of the President, they can’t go back to school because they haven’t provided the wherewithal for schools to open.(06:43)
You’re asked to risk your neck because you can’t work from home where the risk of COVID are kept outside. That’s because you’re a police officer, a firefighter, a nurse, or you’re working on an assembly line in customer service or a checkout counter, or here in Vegas in hospitality. If you’re a housekeeper, a casino worker, the ones who built this very stage. Governor Sisolak, your members of Congress are doing everything they possibly can to help turn things around. Governor, you’ve been focused and responsible. You followed science and put public health and safety. You made tough calls that saved lives. Working around the clock so we can reopen schools and the economy safely. Your members of Congress, have done the same.(07:44)
And the House passed what they call the HEROES Act months ago. Would have provided billions of dollars to help states keep first responders on the job. The safety measures needed, the PPP needed to open our schools and businesses but Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell, Republican leader did nothing to move the legislation. Nothing in June, nothing in July, nothing in August, nothing in September, things getting worse and worse and worse. And as people struggled and suffered, what did they focus on? If this wasn’t so serious, you’d think I’m making it up. What they focused on is more tax cuts for the wealthy, not a joke. They’re proposal adds another $30 billion tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. Cuts in funding. Cutting the means by which we fund the Social Security system, leading the actuary of Social Security to say if they do it, by 2023, mid-2023, there’ll be no money for Social Security.(08:54)
And a relentless effort to eliminate, as Alejandro said, the Affordable Care Act, which provides healthcare coverage for 22 million people, over 100 million with pre-existing conditions. This is going on at the same time he’s already cost 10 million people their health insurance because their companies have gone bankrupt. It’s unconscionable. Instead of focusing on our needs, your needs, he’s trying to take your healthcare away. He’s literally before the Supreme Court as I speak to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, take away that healthcare for 20 million Americans. That’s 282,000 Nevadans. Take away federal protections for preexisting conditions, 1.2 million Nevadans. And complications from COVID like lung scarring and heart damage could well become the next pre-existing condition. Striking down the Affordable Care Act would toss out the rule that allows our children to be covered on their parents’ insurance policy until age 26. Take us backward when insurance companies could change a woman more for healthcare than a man for the same procedure, just because she’s a woman. Take away Medicare benefits for seniors. Increase their drug prescription costs.(10:28)
And just as he vowed to “terminate” as I said earlier the funding for Social Security. The idea that in just a few years could put at risk 410,000 Nevadans that rely on a dignified retirement because of Social Security. And during all this, not once did President Trump call a high-level meeting of Democrats and Republicans to the White House to resolve these issues. I’ve served with a lot of presidents, never, no matter how good or bad you thought they were did they fail to try to bring parties together in the White House to reach a settlement. You know why? He spent so much time hiding in the bunker in the White House or on the bunker of his golf course, playing hundreds of rounds of golf.(11:27)
And then this Tuesday, what’d he do? He said, “End the discussions.” He wasn’t even starting them. No more negotiations. No more negotiations. And now today he says, “Well, I’m back.” One thing for sure, Donald Trump shows no urgency to deliver hardworking Americans, like the family I grew up in. Like all of you. What they need now desperately. For exactly two months since the emergency small business program that your congresspeople voted, for has closed down two months of small business owners in Nevada and across the country, waiting, hoping, for just a little extra help to be able to stay open. Now we have more than 400,000 small businesses have been permanently closed.(12:20)
By the way, the largest employers in America are small businesses. Millions more are struggling to hang on. How many more will go under? How many more dreams will be extinguished because of the selfishness of this President and the Republican leaders in Congress? Make no mistake, if you’re out of work, if your business is closed, if your child’s school was shut down, if you’re facing eviction, as millions are, over 20 million Americans worry about whether they’re going to be able to pay their mortgage next month. None of that seems to matter to Donald Trump. You’re a firefighter, police officer, who depends on state and local budgets. He’s turned his back on you as well, because they’ve got to balance their budgets. They’re being laid off all over America.(13:12)
When Barack and I were elected, we inherited the worst recession short of the Great Depression in history. He put me in charge of what’s called the Recovery Act. $800 billion. We passed and needed to get out into the economy within 18 months to prevent a depression. We did it with less than two tenths percent of waste or fraud. And I was able to see to it that the states in order to keep moving, keep teachers, firefighters, first responders, all employed. I was able to get $140 billion in aid out to the states. Right here in Clark County, I was able to bring to $1.2 billion to keep your economy going. We have that ability now.(14:04)
The House has already passed a similar piece of legislation. And we started the longest sustained recovery in American history. But you know what Mitch McConnell said about help with the states. I’m not making this up. He said, “Let them go bankrupt. Let them go bankrupt.” What in the hell is he talking about? Folks, we’re so much better than this. We can turn this crisis into progress. We contain this virus and fully reopen our economy. We make up 4% of the world’s population and we have 20% of the world’s deaths. If we just follow the science, expand testing and tracing, social distance, washing our hands, implementing nationwide mask mandates. Don’t politicize the race for a vaccine, Mr. President. Just have a plan for safe and equitable distribution.(15:14)
On the economy, bring the Congress back together to pass real relief to help people who’ve lost their unemployment checks as well. And then implement a comprehensive agenda that I’ve laid out to make bold investments so we can build back better. He keeps talking about the Republicans. Some Republicans, a lot of them are acknowledging and supporting me, but a lot of them also are talking about, “Well, Biden’s going to spend all this money.” Well, guess what? The independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a Wall Street firm did a detailed analysis of my recovery plan and the President’s. And here’s what they said, it’s off of Wall Street, that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs in four years. 7 million more jobs than the President’s plan. And $1 trillion more in economic growth than the President’s plan.(16:18)
Democrats know how to get things done. Here’s how my plan works. It’s not going to raise a penny in tax for anyone making less than $400,000 a year. Not a penny. And how am I going to pay for all this? I’m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to start paying their fair share. You realize that the Fortune 500 companies, 92 of them making billions of dollars, don’t pay a single penny in taxes. It’s wrong. Donald Trump paying $720 in taxes? Come on. The money we raise by eliminating the $1.3 trillion of his $2 trillion tax cut that affects the super wealthy and corporations, we’re going to invest in working people. We’re going to grow the middle class to make sure everyone’s included on the deal.(17:23)
The kinds of investment that will stimulate the economy, including industries like tourism and hospitality. To get back to full employment fast and help build back better than before. It means the analysis shows creating millions of good paying union jobs. Manufacturing and technology. Making sure our future is made in America. We and the President in the White House gives out $600 billion in contracts per year. Well guess what? While I’m President, it’s going to go to no outfit that doesn’t make it in America, the whole thing, and sell it in America. I mean it.(18:17)
And infrastructure. Building roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports, and clean energy. Upgrading four million buildings and weatherizing, two million homes, creating at least a million good paying jobs in the process. Making the climate safer, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. We’ll deal with climate change by creating millions of union jobs that build a climate resilience of our cities and our towns fighting back stronger, more frequent wildfires. Beating heat waves, droughts, hurricanes, and floods. By the way, did you hear what the President said about hurricanes this summer? He was told about how they’re coming across the warm water in the Atlantic and the closer they get to the shore, the worse they get. You know what he said, Alejandro? He said, “Maybe we should drop an atomic weapon on them and blow them up.” As we say in my religion, “Bless me father for I have sinned.” What’s going on here?(19:27)
Under my plan, small business come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts. We’re going to get $50 billion in new capital, especially for minority owned businesses and small businesses. We’re going to make another hundred billion dollars in low-interest loans available to these businesses, creating jobs, increasing economic growth and increasing incomes. A $15 minimum wage. I’m dreaming here. But a $15 minimum wage for our essential workers. We’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to pay you with a good wage. Ensure you have strong benefits. We’ll ease the burden of the major cost in your life. We’ll build the Affordable Care Act, writing knew health insurance options, not for-profit public options, which give private insurers a real competitor. We’re going to increase subsidies for premiums and lower your costs. Increase plans that will lower deductibles and lower out of pocket expenses. And we’re going to take on the pharmaceutical industry with a plan that will slash costs of prescription drugs by 50%.(20:44)
The reason I’m not going to more detail, you’ve been out here a long time, let’s give me one example. If in fact Medicare is able to negotiate for all the drugs they buy and say you’re not going to be able to sell them to them unless you pay the price we’re suggesting, that would drop by 60% the cost the cost of drugs.(21:06)
We’ll also make high quality childcare available and accessible. We’ll work with the states to ensure that every three, four year old will get access to free, high quality preschool. Not, not, not daycare. We’re going to make sure low and middle income families never have to spend more than 7% of their income to care for young children. Because if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burdens that created the care for families that are caring for raising a child and an aging loved one. Look at the professional caregivers out there, home health care workers, childcare workers, who are more often women. Women of color immigrants, are too often underpaid, under seen and undervalued. That’s why my Build Back Better plan will elevate the compensation, benefits and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators. We’re also going to triple the funding for Title I schools like the one behind me here, which served high number of children from low-income families.(22:11)
We’re going to make four years of public college and universities tuition free for any family that makes less than $125,000 a year. We’re going to make community college and job training programs free for all hardworking Americans that qualify. And if you’re buying your first home, we’re going to provide a $15,000 tax credit to help you get there. We’re going to protect Social Security. Increase benefits for millions of seniors. Look, I’m not going to lay it out, but go to joebiden.com. Go to Moody’s, look it up. We pay for all this and we grow the economy at the same time.(22:54)
The fact is, President of the United States can only see the world from Park Avenue. He thinks Wall Street built this country and CEOs. I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont. Communities like some that you live in. I know the middle-class working people built this country. The measure of economic success has been what our families are talking about around the kitchen table. Are you able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay?”(23:27)
How many times do you know somebody… This morning I had to say, look, I know those tires are bald, but you got to ride on them for another 20,000 miles. We just don’t have the money. We just can’t do it now.” Who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to school because we can’t continue to borrow the money to keep her in that community college? There was a discussion that took place around my table and I’m sure yours as well. But if we’re going to get anything done, we got to come together.(23:57)
I made a speech I worked really, really hard on and thought really hard about before I made it in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on the battlefield last week. I said at that time that we’re facing a crisis, not unlike we did after Gettysburg. I said there that I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. The work is hard for those who don’t support me as those who do, because after all this country has been through, after all that America has accomplished, after all the years, we stood as a beacon of light to the world we cannot be that here and now, in 2020, we allow the government, the government of the people, by the people, and for the people, to perish from this earth.(25:01)
Folks, we have it our hands. And I made this in the bottom of heart, we have in our hands the ultimate power. And what’s the ultimate power in a democracy? The power to vote. Here in Nevada, the best thing you can do is vote early and return your ballot quickly. Ballots here in Clark County were mailed two days ago, on Wednesday. You can return your ballot by mail. You can drop it off at a drop box or vote in person during the early vote or on election day. But just make a plan. Seriously, go to iwillvote.com/nv. Make a plan. Don’t risk any delays, return that mail and ballot as soon as you can. Make sure your voice is heard.(25:58)
We can be better than what we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. I’m confident we can bring Democrats and Republicans together again with him gone. Folks, conclude by saying there has never, ever, ever been anything the United States has been unable to accomplish when we’ve done it together. Never, never, never. So folks let’s stand up and vote and take back this country now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. (silence)"
biden_speech_mayors.txt,"(03:33)
Hello everybody. Very great to be back with all of you and Keisha, thank you for your friendship and Eric yours as well. And you’re both been doing a heck of a job. Look, I want to thank everything you’re doing and for the faith you’ve placed in may so early on, but look, I’ve had the privilege of speaking to this body many, many times over the years from the time I was a senator and as Vice President, and I’ve always had enormous respect for just how tough your jobs are. I’m not being solicitous. I used to be a county councilman in Delaware. I only ran for the United States Senate because I realized how hard local office is. I kiddingly say that I did it because, I ran for the Senate because it was easier.(04:14)
But the quality of people’s lives is so much more in your hands and on your shoulders than anyone else. Making sure people feel safe walking down the street, making sure the garbage gets collected, making sure the schools are safe and open. All the concrete things that make everyday life or break everyday life. They’re not partisan things. They’re just practical things. People look to you, Democrats and Republicans. You’re also on the front lines of emergencies. From fires to floods, to school shootings, to public health issues, helping save lives as well as livelihoods. That’s why I’ve made it a priority of my entire career to work closely with you.(04:54)
From the time I got to the senate 180 years ago, as well as my tenure, as vice president. You know, if I have the honor of becoming your president, I make this commitment to you. You’re going to have an access directly to the White House. I’m going to be right there with you, helping you and your communities based on what you think you need and the challenge you’re facing because the president, the mayor pointed out that it is about all from the bottom up. It doesn’t go from the top down. We’re dealing with four historic crises all at once. A once in a century pandemic that has claimed over 200,000 American lives, a devastating economic recession, a long overdue reckoning on racial justice and a change in climate that’s ravaging communities all across the country.(05:43)
I need not tell that to Eric and the mayors in California and Oregon and Washington state. Not one of those crises should have a partisan dimension. I really mean that. Not one single one. If I get elected president, I’m not going to be the Democratic president, I’m going to be an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, whether your city is red or blue, I’m going to be there. I promise you. Frankly, we should be able to address each one of these the same way mayors solve problems, by leading with the facts and with reality, putting the wellbeing of our constituents first, uniting people around solutions that work for everybody, but tragically, that isn’t how this current administration is wired.(06:25)
The only problems that matter to this president seem to be problems that affect him personally. He defines everything in a red and blue, blue states, red states, Democratic cities, Republican cities. I think that’s explains why one day before we hit 200,000 deaths, the president held a campaign rally and insisted that the virus was, “Affects virtually nobody.” Then he went on to say, “except elderly people with heart conditions and problems.” Ask the folks in their communities how they feel about that. Their parents that are being referred to by the president as nobodies. Ask their families of that empty seat at kitchen table this morning, if that’s true they’re nobodies. Kids who lost their teachers. Parents, and grandparents, friends or coworkers, sisters or brothers, never going to see again.(07:17)
The problems we’re facing affects all of us, every one of us in every community. I think this may be the toughest time in a long time to be a mayor, especially a big city mayor, but that’s not true across the board. Mayors have faced adversity before. Some of you remember back in 2008, the economy was in free fall. We were losing 700,000 jobs a month because of the recession we inherited. Families lost, and I know you remember this, families lost more than $16 trillion, families, in personal wealth. People who had never missed a mortgage payment, all of a sudden were underwater, being foreclosed on because of the number of foreclosures that occurred on their streets significantly reducing the value of their home.(08:05)
Was devastated. We didn’t solve it by saying, “You’re on your own. It’s what it is.” We came together. With your leadership, we passed and implemented the Recovery Act. We provided $140 billion in state and local fiscal relief, keeping law enforcement and firefighters on the job. We sent more than $50 billion to your school districts saving more than 300,000 education jobs. We provided the Middle Class Tax Relief, helping families send their kids to college, to buy their first home. We invested in the future. We put $48 billion in infrastructure projects building 42,000 miles of roads, nearly 27,000 bridges to go along with the biggest clean energy investment in all of our history, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.(08:58)
And I said then and I say again, you should be able to make the decisions of what your city most needs. It shouldn’t have to go through your state legislatures all the time. You should have an opportunity. Even conservative economist acknowledge that what we did saved us from a depression. When the president gave me the honor of leading the recovery effort, first thing I did, I went to the mayors. Some of you were still around then. I spoke with over 200 mayors. Because of you, we came through the moment together. I really mean it. I spoke on the phone constantly. That’s the same approach we should be taking today.(09:37)
It starts with your budgets. You have to balance your budgets. You’re getting squeezed like never before. Local services are getting pared back, municipal jobs are falling by the wayside, furloughs and layoffs, compounding the devastation. We still have no effective of national standard for curbing the virus, which is infuriating because scientists insist we can save 110,000… They expect close to 200,000 more lives to be lost between now and January. They insist we can save 110,000 by the end of the year by simply wearing masks, and that’s straightening your budget even more because it keeps businesses from opening, opening back up. It keeps emergency rooms full and holds down your cities from springing back to life.(10:30)
There is no reason, none, why we can’t work together, we can’t work together again to overcome these challenges. You all know the House passed the Heroes Act, which should provide $915 billion in local and state government. It’s collecting dust right now on the Senate. Majority leader who I know well says, “Let the states go bankrupt.” [inaudible 00:10:58] having a local emergency fund that drives resources straight to you, expand your health infrastructure, reimburses overtime pay for the essential workers and first responders. Whatever your community needs the most, it isn’t all about resources though.(11:20)
The time when people are crying out for justice, exercising the right to peacefully protest, it’s falling on you to keep the peace and god, it’s a tough job on any circumstances. It’s nearly impossible where the president scapegoats his mayors and fans the flame of division. We can work together to build trust and accountability between police and communities, to condemn all violence, while still addressing the pain and injustice that they’re feeling and rooting out systemic racism. And as you all deal with the effects of extreme weather, fires, floods, superstorms where it’s like we’ve never seen.(12:00)
We can work together to invest in our communities to make them more resilient to climate change. The problems are different in every… Some places it’s about flooding, some places it’s about being wiped out by storms along the coast where I live. Sometimes it’s about being safe, just keeping people safe from fires, but it also is about being able to create millions of jobs, modernizing your buildings and your transportation system, making your community stronger, greener, better position to seize the opportunities in the years ahead. That’s what I plan on doing to get to you. That’s what we did when I was vice-president. That’s what we’ll do if I have the honor of becoming your president.(12:40)
What we can’t do though, is divide ourselves into pieces. That’s the only strategy this president seems to know, but it doesn’t work. It can distract you from a problem. It can create a new problem that occupy your attention, but it can’t actually solve anything. You all know better than anyone, dividing ourselves gets us nowhere. We have to work together in good faith, competently, efficiently leading with the facts. We can disagree on policies but we have to cooperate. It’s only the way we’re going to come out of these crises and ensure that our best days are still ahead, which I firmly believe they are.(13:22)
That’s what we’ve done, tried to do in this campaign and that’s what I’ll do as president. Work with all of you. Democrats, Republicans, independents. As I said, if I’m elected president, I’m not going to be a democratic president, I’m going to be an American president. Blue cities, red cities it does not matter to me. I promise you. Every American community deserves the full support of an American president.(13:46)
Look, being a mayor and you know I’m not kidding about this, is hard under the best of circumstances, but the worst thing a president can do is to drive wedges and make your job tougher because he thinks it benefits him or stirs up chaos in your communities. You deserve a partner who’ll listen to you, who’ll work with you, work on your priorities. Someone who gets your back and saves your back, works to cover your back no matter what you are and no matter what challenge you’re facing.(14:22)
This moment we’re facing now, isn’t a partisan moment. It’s an American moment. It sounds corny, doesn’t it? But it’s true, it’s an American moment. It’s a chance for us to overcome anger and division that has hold us back of late for far too long. We can emerge from these crises. We can do what we’re best at doing, unite, work together. And it starts with the mayors. And I really mean that. It starts with all of you. I promise you. If I’m elected, you will have direct access to the White House. I want to thank you all because we need you to build back better. You are the foundation stone, not a joke. You’re the ones leading away. And what people don’t realize is over the last six years more young people are moving into cities than out of cities.(15:21)
There’s so many possibilities. We got to stop the hate and the division now, we got to stop pouring flames on the fire, we got to start talking straight to the American people. That’s what you all do. You do it every day. I want to make it clear to you, I’ve never been more optimistic and I’ve been doing this a long time about the prospects for this country than I am today. The blinders have been taken off the American people. They understand what’s going on now. They understand. They understand it’s about all of us. They want to get things done. And so it’s going to start with you. I promise you I’ll have your back. I mean that sincerely. Look in my record, I have, and I want to make sure that your ideas are the ones that are funneled up. They don’t have to go through a state legislature, go through a governor. They can go straight to the federal government, straight to me. I really mean it. So God bless you. May God protect our troops and thank you for what you do. Your job is too hard for me."
biden_speech_miami.txt,"(17:15)
Good afternoon, everyone. It’s great to be back in Miami. And thank you, Esther. I told you our family has been, unfortunately, this considerable consumer of healthcare. Please all sit down. Of healthcare and I’ve learned from personal experience as my sons, my daughter, my wife, family has learned if there are any angels in heaven, they’re all nurses, male and female. Docs let you live and nurses make you want to live. I really mean it. They’re there at the tough times. And by the way, thank you for your service in the military, but also thank you for the beginning of this pandemic.(18:10)
Being a surgical nurse wasn’t easy when there wasn’t the PPE available to all of you as you walked into those operating rooms and dealt with all the problems. I know my son-in-law’s a physician surgeon in Philadelphia and the stories at the beginning of this process, when we should have had everything available. So thank you not only for your skill and your courage, but your bravery and doing what you’ve done. And I want to thank you for the care dedication that you went on, all your fellow SEIU members, all your nurses that show up and struggle with illness or coping with the loss of a loved one in terrible times.(18:56)
So many of you had to hold a phone to a patient’s ear to say goodbye to a family member because they couldn’t be there. They couldn’t see them in the hospital as they passed. Now, I want to thank Victoria, Victoria for sharing her family’s journey with us today. Victoria and I were talking a little bit earlier. I was in South Asia speaking with a president and he asked me what made America unique? And I said immigration because it’s the history of this country. And he looked at me funny. He said, why is that?(19:37)
And I said, because almost everybody who’s come here, other than those who came in chains 400 years ago came because they’re escaping something and it took enormous courage. I really mean this. Think about it, enormous courage to leave everything they knew, everything that was familiar, sometimes leaving family members to get on a boat, a plane, train, whatever the means was to be able to leave and start a new life. And to do that, you have to have optimism, courage. You have to be resilient. You have to be willing to believe you can make things change for the better.(20:17)
That’s what’s built this country, immigration. We are, not figuratively, it’s a phrase used to not often fully appreciated, a nation of immigrants. That’s why we’re the most unique and strongest nation in the world. It’s family like yours and Esther’s that have made this country what it is through the hard work and faith and perseverance. The richness and beauty of Miami is built from the connections of family, culture, values that we share with our friends throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. Earlier this afternoon, I visited Little Haiti.(20:53)
Had been some years since been there when the earthquake occurred and I came to deliver some assistance to the Haitian community, as well as making sure we had temporary protective status granted. It’s a cultural complex and now here at the site name for one of Cuba’s most celebrated poets and thinkers. This city is living proof of the incredible strength that we draw from families and communities from every culture choosing America. So thank you, Victoria, for choosing us and I’m really honored that you’re going to vote for me in your first election.(21:33)
I promise you I will not let you down. I promise you I will not let you down. And let me also say at the top, my prayers continue to be with the president and the first lady for their health and safety as they like so many American families are dealing with COVID-19. I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend. Now that he’s busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this, listen to the scientists, support masks, support a mask mandate nationwide, require a mask in every federal building and facility and interstate travel, urge every governor, mayor to do the same.(22:21)
We know it saves lives. His administration just rejected a mask mandate for public transportation on Friday. The CIA came along and said, we need to be protected and they said, no. I believe that was wrong and not very rational experts say that universal masking could say between now and January 100,000 lives. Let me say that again. Between now and January, mandatory masking could save 100,000 lives. I backed that mandate months ago. He should back it now. Since the president entered the hospital on Friday, since Friday, more than 100,000 more people have been diagnosed with COVID.(23:19)
And this week, at least 5,000 more will die. Cases and deaths are climbing in many states. I hope the president’s recovery is swift and successful, but our nation’s covered crisis is far, far from over. Today, my prayers are with the families of the 210,000 Americans who died from the virus. All those families who got up this morning and there was an empty chair at the breakfast table, tonight, an empty chair at the dinner table where one should be, husband, wife, son, daughter, mother, father. And nearly 7.5 million Americans-(24:02)
And nearly 7.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus to date. This pandemic and economic collapse has hit the Hispanic communities, particularly hard. Nationally, the infection rate among Hispanics is almost three times higher than white, non Hispanics. More than 40,000 Hispanics have died from COVID-19, devastating families and close knit communities of loved ones. And here in Florida, where Hispanics make up about one quarter of the population, they make up 37% of the COVID deaths.(24:44)
Nearly 3 million Hispanics are unemployed. If you break that down, that last data, unemployment for Hispanic women and Hispanic youth actually went up last month. One in three Hispanic, small business owners have taken a hit and many are likely to have to close permanently. Some economists are calling this what they call a K shaped recovery. It means those at the top, they keep going up, their income. But everyone from the middle and lower-income, it keeps going down, keeps getting worse. Means that essential workers, so many of whom are Hispanic, have sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern American history. Because while workers are struggling, this is a shocking statistic, but it’s true, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just since the COVID crisis they have made an additional $300 billion. The top 100 additional made an additional $300 billion. Everyone else though, they got the bottom half of that K, downward, a downward slide.(26:09)
You’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay your bills, put food on the table, pay the rent, or if you’re lucky enough to own a home, will you have enough money to pay the mortgage? How to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids, because their school has gone remote. You’re asked to risk your neck if you can’t work from home, while the risk of COVID are mostly kept outside, because you’re one of our first responders, a union nurse like Ester or on an assembly line, or working in a customer service or tourism industry or at a checkout counter or police office, firefighter. I know this isn’t an easy time, but I also think this pandemic has just helped us rip off the blinders in this country as how inequitable so many things are. People didn’t even realize, and so now they’ve seen it.(27:16)
I truly believe we have a tremendous opportunity to turn this moment of crisis in a moment of great progress for the country. That’s why I’ve laid out a comprehensive agenda, not just to rebuild our communities, but to build them back, make bold investments in them so we can build back better than before the crisis.(27:40)
An independent analysis, President talks about… he loves talking about Wall Street. He never talks about Moody’s on wall street that pointed out, they did a detailed assessment of my economic plan and his. And here’s what Moody’s concluded. They projected my economic plan will create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more jobs in the president’s economic plan will in four years and $1 trillion more in growth than the president’s plan.(28:14)
And here’s how it works. I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. You won’t pay a penny more. I guarantee you. But I’m going to ask the big corporations and the super wealthy to begin to pay their fair share. It’s not punishment. It just about time you start paying your fair share. The money we raise from making sure they pay their fair share will allow me to invest it in working people on a growing middle class.(28:50)
When I announced I said I wanted to rebuild the backbone of this country. Working folks, the middle class. They weren’t built by wall street. It was built by labor. Advance racial equity across the economy to make sure everyone is included in the deal this time. We’re going to invest it in creating millions of good paying jobs, union jobs in manufacturing and technology, making sure our future is made in America. In infrastructure, building roads, bridges, highways, ports, and airports like I was able to do when I ran the Recovery Act for our administration, putting billions of dollars in the Port of Miami, creating so good, hard working people with good decent union jobs, able to accommodate the new supertankers coming through the canal, generating some stability.(29:50)
My plan will make sure Hispanic communities benefit from hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, to fill the cracks in the sidewalks, install broadband, close the digital divide, create spaces to live, work, and play in safely.(30:07)
And clean energy. We upgrade 4 million buildings, weatherize 2 million homes. We’ll create, at least, the estimates are at least 1 million good paying jobs and save us millions and millions of barrels of oil. We’re going to meet the threat of climate change and invest in strengthening climate resilience, where we are already dealing with an existential threat of climate change. I don’t have to tell you in Miami, don’t have to tell you in South Florida or in my state, which has the lowest sea level, lowest degree of height from sea level than any state in the nation. Stronger, more frequent hurricanes, rising tides, flooding. And no matter where the president says, maybe you should consider dropping an atomic weapon on a hurricane coming our way is not a good idea. It doesn’t work. Look, that’s not some distant future in Miami or South Florida. You’re dealing with it right now. What do you have to do to get knocked in the head to understand it?(31:18)
We’re going to make sure the small businesses could come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts. My plan will get $50 billion in capital flowing to small businesses, which would get repaid in employment and taxes, especially minority owned small businesses and make another $100 billion in low interest loans available to those businesses to get back on their feet and stay alive, because you know as well as I do, and ethnic communities, they are the heartbeat, they’re the center of a community. Whether it’s a grocery store, a beauty shop, the barbershop, the hardware store, the essence of a community. We’re going to make investments to increase incomes as well. It’s long past time. I’ve worked with Governor Cuomo to get it done in New York and other governors across the country. No one should have to work two jobs to be able to be 40 hours a week, so they’re above the poverty rate. $15 should be a minimum wage in the United States of America, period.(32:29)
And for our essential workers, we’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to begin to pay you a good wage, be sure you have strong benefits. We’re going to ease the burden of the major costs in your life. What are they? Healthcare. We’re going to build on the Affordable Care Act, which gave 4 million Hispanic people in this country health insurance, by adding a new health insurance option, a not for profit public option. We’re going to give private insurers a real competitor. We’re going to increase subsidies, so your premiums are lower and you can and afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses.(33:10)
We’re going to take on the pharmaceutical industry, a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. You think I’m making these numbers up. If we just let Medicare negotiate independently for all the drugs they purchase, I promise you the rates are going to fall through the floor. Affordable and accessible.(33:33)
Every three and four year old will have access to free quality preschool. All the studies at great universities and all the ones around the country have shown that no matter what zip code a child comes from, no matter what background, if they go to preschool, not daycare, preschool in school at three, four, and five years old, they increase exponentially, over by over 50% a prospect they’ll go through all 12 years and many beyond.(34:04)
And we’ll make sure, sure that low and middle-income… and by the way, the total cost of that… it’s called Title 1 program. We now spend $15 billion for in school districts that don’t have high tax rates. Well, guess what? You change that to 45. You can put every one of these kids in school, pay the teachers legitimate rate and make sure that you have school psychologists and social workers in those schools. We’re going to make sure that for childcare, for someone under the age of five or six, no one ever has to pay more than 7% of their income for their young children to get quality childcare, because you truly want to reward work in this country. We have to ease the financial burden of the care that families are carrying. Even before the pandemic, and many of you know it and many of you are doing it, millions of working families faced enormous financial and personal strains, trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability.(35:04)
It’s going to sound strange, when I first got elected, when I was 29 years old to Senate, right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed. My two sons survived after hospitalized for a long time. I needed help do my job. I could not possibly afford childcare. Even though I was making a really good salary of $42,000 a year, more than I’d ever made. And I couldn’t afford it. Being a single mom or dad or a family that has two people working with young children, it’s incredibly costly. And by the way, and the professional caregivers out there, home health workers, childcare workers, were more often women, women of color and immigrants, and too often underpaid, unseen and undervalued. That’s why my build back better plan will elevate the compensation, benefits and dignity of caregiver-(36:03)
… Back Better Plan will elevate the compensation benefits and dignity of caregivers and workers and early childhood educators. That’s what we’re going to do. It’s also going to invest in education beyond high school. If you qualify to get into community college, you’ll automatically be able to go, and you’ll be able to go for free. If you are qualified to get into a four-year public school in your state public college, and your family makes less than $125, 000 a year, you get to go free. If you’re buying your first home, you’re going to have a tax credit up to $15,000 to get there. What happened after the Great Recession in this one? An awful lot of you range in age from the millennials have started off back after 9/11, all the way to the people graduating this year… Are not in a position to do that, because your jobs have been postponed or non-existent. But providing an opportunity, I can get you into the system.(37:09)
We’re also going to protect Social Security, increase the benefits for millions of seniors. We’re going to do that all in a partnership and lockstep with the Hispanic community. And by the way, the President’s proposal to eliminate the tax you pay when you get your paycheck for Social Security, without any means by which to replace it, the actuary at social security said Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023. They’ve never liked it to begin with. So look, success and prosperity of the Hispanic Americans is indispensable to the success and prosperity of the United States, and of all America. It’s that simple. Hispanic families are responsible today for $2.6 trillion of our gross domestic product, and growing. If that was a standalone economy, a country all by itself, it would be the eighth largest economy in the world. Think of that.(38:20)
Now imagine how much more that would grow if everyone had access to the tools they need to succeed. By investing in Hispanic communities, we’re making the smartest possible investment with the greatest possible returns that our nation could make, period. We also need to rebuild our ability to work with our partners throughout the Western hemisphere to realize the enormous potential of this region in the world, to confront those leaders who continue to oppress the rights of their people. We should be leading the international effort to confront the massive humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. Maduro, who I’ve met, is a dictator, plain and simple, and he’s causing incredible suffering among the Venezuelan people to maintain his grip on power. The Venezuelan people need our support to recover or their democracy and rebuild their country.(39:19)
That’s why I would immediately grant temporary protective status to Venezuelans as President. So the Republicans in the Senate can’t keep blocking it like they did again just last week. I’ll make sure we’re supporting neighboring countries that are being overrun with immigration because of Maduro, like Columbia, which are caring for millions of Venezuelans who’ve fled their country in desperation. I’ll use sanctions as one of the tools for a comprehensive strategy that includes humanitarian assistance, international pressure, and support for democratic actors in Venezuela to force the regime to embark on the road to a free and fair election. We also need a new Cuba policy. The administration’s approach is not working. Cuba is no closer to freedom and democracy than it was four years ago. The fact there’s more political prisoners, the secret police are as brutal as ever, and Russia is once again a major presence in Cuba in Havana… For my entire career, I strived for democracy and human rights, for freedom of the press, assembly and religion against dictators of the left and the right. As President, my policy will be governed by two principles.(40:40)
First, Americans, especially Cuban-Americans, are the best ambassadors for freedom in Cuba. Second, empowering the Cuban people to determine their own future is central to a national security interest in the United States. I think it’s unconscionable that the current administration is deporting hundreds of Cubans back to a dictatorship. There are almost 10,000 Cubans languishing in tent camps along the Mexican border because the administration’s anti-immigration agenda. That’s the administration actively separating Cuban families by not processing visas, through restrictions on family visits and remittances. I think we have to reverse that. The bottom line is that President Trump can not advance the democracy and human rights for the American people when he has embraced so many autocrats around the world, starting with Vladimir Putin.(41:40)
Folks, we can do this. We can reach for more as a nation. We can rebuild. We can rebuild the backbone of this country and finally bring everybody along. America’s always done best coming out of crisis. We’re the only nation it’s always come out of every crisis better than we went in. We can build a new administration that reflects the full diversity of our nation, including Hispanic communities. And Hispanic voters, especially in Florida, can help put our nation on a new path forward. And here in Florida today as the deadline to register to vote ends today… If you haven’t registered, go out right now because it is an obligation. Every vote will make a difference. Check and make sure your family and friends are registered, and then make sure everyone has a plan to vote.(42:44)
If you can vote by mail, vote by mail. If you can vote in person, vote in person, if you can vote early, vote early. You can vote early in person starting on October 19th in many places in Florida, including right here in Miami. Just make sure you vote. Together we can win. We can’t let this pandemic change everything. We’ve got to get it under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone. We can come together as a nation. I’m running as a Democrat. Proud of it, but I will be an American President, not a democratic President with a capital D. I’ll fight as hard for you and your family whether you vote for me or whether you vote against me because there’s nothing we can’t do when we do it together.(43:34)
Folks, I’ve been other more optimistic about our chances as a nation in the 21st century than I’ve been my whole career. There’s not a single solitary thing that’s beyond our capacities as a nation. I mean that sincerely. The most talented workers in the world… We’re the most incredible system in the world. We have a people, who when they stand together, have never, ever, ever, ever failed. Every time I’d walk out of my grandpa’s house up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.” My grandma, when she was alive, would yell back, “No, Joey, spread it.” Let’s go spread the faith. Take back this country. We’re so much better than this. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you.(44:34)

Hey folks. Good afternoon. Before I start, let me explain the delay. We wanted to make sure that we’re doing everything by the numbers. And so I got two COVID tests this morning, one in Delaware, and one by the former White House doc who came up and everything’s cleared. We want to make sure everything was clear before I came. We were supposed to have an event after this at a headquarters, but based on the crowd size and an indoor, it was concluded by the docs that best not to do it. But I want to thank all of you. I want to thank Matt. And Matt, you’re dead right. You were putting yourself on the line and a lot of other people did all across this country in your union. And I want to thank David way, Secretary-Treasurer of local 951, for having me here today.(04:51)
Look, I’d like to start by acknowledging which I sure all of you do as well. Sending my prayers for the health and safety of the first lady and president of the United States after they tested positive for COVID-19. My wife, Jill and I pray that they’ll make a quick and full recovery. This is not a matter of politics. It’s a bracing reminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously. It’s not going away automatically. We have to do our part to be responsible. It means following the science, listening to the experts, washing our hands, social distancing. It means wearing a mask in public and means encouraging others to do so as well. It means having masking mandates nationwide. The director of the CDC, Center for Disease Control, Dr. Red field said, and I quote, and he held up a mask. He said, “These face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have.”(05:56)
Then he held the mask up again and said, “This face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than a vaccine.” Leading scientist from the University of Washington tell us that we can save more than 100,000 American lives in the next 100 days alone if everyone wore a mask in public. So let me repeat that because it’s so important. We can save 100,000 lives in the next 100 days, according to the head of the CDC, if everyone wears a mask in public. So be patriotic. It’s not about being a tough guy. It’s about doing your part. Wearing a mask is not only going to protect you, but it also protects those around you. Your mom, your dad, your brother, your sister, husband, wife, neighbor, coworker. Don’t just do it for yourself, do it for the people you love, the people you work with. The seriousness of this virus also underscores that we need regular testing with results turned around rapidly and that’s available to everyone.(07:08)
It’s not just the folks in the White House or who travel with me that deserved regular testing, it’s folks in the meatpacking and food processing plants, grocery store workers. Every single American deserves safety and peace of mind. And it means we need transparency. Those who test positive need to participate in contact tracing so that everyone who they may have exposed can get tested themselves. That’s how you stop transmission for any epidemic. Is basic. We need to take the science of fighting this disease seriously if we’re going to save lives. And above all the news is a reminder that we, as a nation, need to do better in dealing with this pandemic. Taking these steps is how we’ll protect ourselves. And just as important is how we will protect one another. Hope that all those who are fighting this virus, including the first family and so many Americans today recover and recover soon. My prayers are with the families of the more than 200. I think it’s seven now. 207,000 Americans who’ve died from this virus.(08:29)
Many haven’t got up this morning. The breakfast table with an the empty chair of someone they lost and they loved. We understand. And there’s more than 7 million Americans who are have been infected. That includes folks here in Grand Rapids and all across Michigan, especially all of you or that you have with UFCW who are on the front lines of this pandemic and on the front lines of this economic crisis. UFCW workers who have always been on the front lines of fighting for dignity and respect you deserve. I know it’s been tough. This morning, September jobs report came out. The last one before election day. I’m grateful for all those who were able to get their jobs back to work again, but it was fewer jobs than we had hoped for. Millions of families, millions are still wondering when it will be their turn to come back from the brink. And the signs according to national press are not encouraging. Once again, the pace of job gains is slowing down. Once again, we’re seeing temporary layoffs turn permanent.(09:44)
This month marked the largest single month increase in long-term unemployment since we started keeping records in 1948. There are now an additional 781,000 Americans who have been trying to find work for at least six months. They’ve been looking for work for at least six months and haven’t found it. And in the past, that’s a sign for permanency for them. We’re still down 647,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started. All told, we are now 30 million workers who have either lost hours, lost paychecks or lost their jobs entirely. Participating in labor force participation fell last month and remains sharply down since this crisis began, especially for women. There’s another roughly 700,000 people who have dropped out of the labor force. Stopped looking for a job. The vast majority were women demonstrating once again how this economic crisis has been especially tough on women and families in This country. This will be the first presidency in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when it came into office.(11:06)
Michigan has lost more than then 361,000 jobs since the beginning of 2017. In fact, factories were already closing before COVID like the Knoll plant here in Grand Rapids. They announced back in January, they were shutting down and cutting 210 local jobs. Manufacturing has already slipped into recession last year. The net loss of auto manufacturing jobs you saw here in Michigan. And that economic pain was only amplified by the pandemic. Your schools and local businesses are closed like all places around America. More than 26 million unemployment claims were filed by Americans last month. 46 million Americans have exhausted their emergency savings and essential workers here in Grand Rapids won’t forget how the UFCW members saw their jobs turned suddenly into a life and death task. Folks, today’s report reinforces another painful trend. A continuing of what economists call a K-shaped recovery. And K means that letter going up. That’s those who on the top, it keeps going up while everyone else in the middle is going down and below. We’re seeing things get worse.(12:43)
It means essential workers, UFCW workers who sacrificed to keep us going through the pandemic and continuing are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern history. Because while workers are struggling, this is a fact, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just the top 100 of them. They’ve made up more than $30 billion this year in the last nine months. And everyone else, though you keep hoping, you get the bottom of that K-shaped recovery. You get the downward slide. You’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay the bills and put food on the table. How to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids because their school has gotten remote. You’re asked to risk your neck because you can’t work from home when the risks for COVID are kept outside because you work at a meat packing plant or an assembly line or the checkout counter. I do understand this is a scary time, an uncertain time.(14:01)
I understand it and I see you because I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. A lot like Grand Rapids. It’s filled with an awful lot of good people busting their neck every day, do the right thing for their families. In Scranton my mom used to have an expression. She said not just in Scranton, but from the time we left there. She said, “Joey, nobody’s better than you Joey, but everybody’s your equal.” My dad’s constant refrain after he lost a job in Scranton when there were no more work and he had to move to Delaware. He moved away for a little over a year and come back every weekend to see us. The time we finally, a couple years down the road in Delaware, got to finally be able to buy a home. My dad used to use this expression. He said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” These are the values that shaped my growing up and I suspect most you.(15:03)
It shaped my whole life. So I know and understood from the very beginning of consciousness about this, that Wall Street and CEOs didn’t build this country, the middle-class built this country and unions built the middle class. That’s why I’ve laid out a comprehensive agenda, not just to rebuild our communities, but to make bold investments so we can build back and bill back better. And independent analysis actually from Wall Street, Moody’s, projected that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs. 7 million more than the administration’s economic plan and $1 trillion more in economics growth than the president’s plan. That’s not coming from a liberal think tank, that’s coming from Moody’s. Here’s how my plan works. I’m going to raise taxes on people only making over 400. Anyone making less than $400,000 a year won’t pay a penny more. But I’m going to ask the very big corporations, the Fortune 500 and the wealthy to pay their fair share for a change. That means raising the corporate tax rate, which was in the mid 30s and now is 21% back to 28%.(16:24)
That means making sure that no big company gets away with paying zero taxes as 91 Fortune 500 companies do today making billions of dollars. Zero taxes. How many of you pay zero taxes? Means making sure the wealthiest Americans don’t get to pay at a lower tax rate because they’re making money on their investments, but they pay at the same rate that they pay for their salary. These changes in the tax code will raise the money, it’ll allow me to invest in working people and growing the middle class. Which is when I announced I was running, I said, that’s the reason. To rebuild the backbone of this country. Hardworking folks in the middle class, we’re going to invest in creating millions of good paying jobs, union jobs. By the way, my plan has been thoroughly analyzed by a whole bunch of folks. Take infrastructure, building roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports will put millions of people to work in good paying union jobs and create the foundation for growth in this country.(17:33)
Clean energy. Just upgrading 4 million buildings and weatherizing 2 million homes will create at least 1 million good paying jobs. Leading in the world on electric vehicles and building 500,000 electric charging stations on our highways will create 1 million new auto jobs here in this state. The manufacturing and technology in those areas, making sure the future is made in America, made in Michigan with good union jobs. The federal government spends $600 billion a year of your tax dollars. 600 billion a year to purchase everything from military equipment to steel, to cars, to trucks, to federal fleets at $600 billion. When I’m president, we’re going to make sure we finally make good on a commitment made a long time ago that these products, all these contracts, that the president of United States and the federal government can award, make sure those products are made by Americans in America. Making sure that, that’s done.(18:53)
It’s estimated that we’ll create 5 million new manufacturing jobs and technology jobs. For small businesses, we’re going to make sure small businesses come out on the other side of this terrible circumstance with access to capital and the ability to deal with the debts that have been accumulated during this pandemic. And we’ll make investments to increase incomes as well. $15 minimum wage. No one should be in a position to have to work two jobs just to get above the poverty line. We’re going to bring back jobs from overseas to America and direct billions of dollars in revitalization funds and competitive grants to help communities like those in Western Michigan compete for new business startups. For our essential workers, we’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to pay you a good wage to ensure you have a strong benefits.(19:54)
We’re going to ease the burden of the major cost in your life. Healthcare. We’ll build on the Affordable Care Act through a new health insurance option, a not-for-profit public option which will give private insurers a real competitor. We’ll increase subsidies for your premiums so they’re lower. So you can afford the plans with lower deductions and lower out-of-pocket expenses. That plan alone will cost over $700 billion over 10 years, but it’s paid for by eliminating those tax cuts. For a 40 year old making $50,000 a year, your monthly premium will go down by a third. We’ll take on the pharmaceutical companies with a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs for up to 60%. Medicare will be able to negotiate prices for drugs fundamentally lowering those prices. And childcare. A lot of you’re dealing with that now. How do you go to work if you have work and take care of your kids or an aging relative that’s in trouble?(21:05)
We’re going to make high quality childcare affordable and accessible. Every three and four year old will have access to free quality preschool. We’re going to make sure that low and middle-income families will never have to pay more than 7% of their income for caring for a young child. In education beyond high school. We’re going to make sure that four year college tuition of a state university is tuition free for any family making less than $125,000. Community college would be free and programs and training will be free as well. If you buying your first home, you’ll have a $15,000 help to get there. These are all things that people have been talking about for a while. We’re going to protect social security, increase the benefits for millions of seniors.(22:00)
The president’s talking about eliminating the withholding tax. Well, that’s wonderful except for one thing, the actuary of social security said if that plan goes through social security will be bankrupt by 2023. Folks, I promise you, we can do this. Let me close by saying this. I know a lot of people around here are tired of feeling overlooked and disrespected. I get that. The people I met this week taking a train through Northeastern, Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. People like the dedicated elementary school teacher from Lordstown, Ohio, whose husband, when Lordstown shut down accepted a transfer to Kentucky eight hours away each direction in order to be able to keep his healthcare and his pension after the GM plant closed. Folks who worry about healthcare. Will the Affordable Care Act still be there for them? Why? Why they ask. Will I be among the 100 million Americans who could lose the protections for pre-existing conditions like asthma and diabetes?(23:15)
Where once again, women will be able to charge a higher premium just simply because they’re a woman. Where insurers no longer have to allow you to be able to keep your kids on a healthcare plan until age 26. What will happen to your Medicare benefits, your social security? Will they still be there when you retire? I’m asked many times in recent years, how do we get to the place where people who stock our shelves, pack our food, teach our kids like my family, take care of my wife, take care of our sick, who race into burning buildings and pick up the garbage off our streets. Who did. How do we get to the place where you all don’t think we see you anymore or hear them and most importantly, respect them? That has to change. I know it can. I come from those neighborhoods. We can get this pandemic under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone. But this cannot be a partisan moment, it must be an American moment.(24:27)
We have to come together as a nation. I’m running as a Democrat, but I will run and govern as an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, I will represent you. And those who see each other as fellow Americans who just don’t live in red states or blue states, but who live in and love the United States of America. That’s who we are. And there’s never been a single solitary thing America’s been unable to do. Think of this. Not once. Not a single thing we’ve not been able to overcome when we’ve done it together. So let’s get the heck up. Remember who in God’s name we are. This is the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. I want to say, God bless you and God protect the first family and every family who’s dealing with this virus and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
biden_speech_NC.txt,"(00:00)
I tell you what. Thanks for sharing your story and it’s what this country’s all about. You’re making your family proud, man. And I wanted to talk, I want to thank the speakers ahead of me. Commissioner, soon to be commissioner Jessica Holmes, where are you Jessica? I know you’re here somewhere. And also state Representative Yvonne Holly, Lewis-Holley. She’s here. Zach Hawkins. Folks, and a great coach, Coach Lawson.(00:35)
I tell you what. My granddaughter’s with me today. And she went to a school that Coach Lawson went to for a little while in Washington. And apparently Coach telling me she’s recruiting some of the girl’s basketball team from where my granddaughter went to school. And she showed me Coach, she showed me a video you were doing for your team, where you made the distinction between competing and winning, the heart of winning and competing. And you talked about, though, working hard and competing. And everybody you pointed out works hard. But you said working hard is absolutely essential, but competing is even more consequential. You can work hard, but did you compete with everything you had? Competing because you know what’s at stake, what is at the heart of winning.(01:35)
My good friends, Congressman, excuse me, G.K. Butterfield and David Price, who represent the first and fourth districts with decency and honor, they can tell you we’re doing both, working hard and we’re competing like we never did before because so much is at stake for this nation. The very soul of the nation is at stake. Folks, as my coaches used to say in college, it’s go time. It’s the most important election in our lifetimes. We’re going to make all the difference here in North Carolina. The choice is clear as it’s ever been. And the stakes have never been higher. The stakes of this election, remind me of something my dad used to say when he lost job up in Scranton, Pennsylvania when I was a kid, when coal died and he moved down to Delaware. He used to always say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.-:35)
That’s right.(02:35)
“It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” Then he said, it’s the God’s truth, if I heard it once I heard it 20 times. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.” That’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. When I grew up surrounded by a lot of hard work and folks in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware were we moved. How many people today though, think they can look their kid in the eye right now and say, “It’s going to be okay,” and mean it. So many people are hurting. Over half the people in America say if they got a bill for $400 they didn’t expect in one month, they wouldn’t be able to pay it. They’d have to borrow the money or they’d have to sell something.(03:21)
Folks, times are hard, unemployment’s way up. Just this week, 1,200,000 people filed for unemployment. Folks are worried about making their next mortgage payment or rent payment. Whether their healthcare will be ripped away in the middle of a pandemic. Worried about sending their kids to school, worried about not sending their kids to school. They see folks at the top, they’re doing better than ever while they’re left to wonder, “Who’s looking out for me.”(03:56)
Well, that’s Donald Trump’s presidency. More than 217,000 Americans dead because of COVID-19. Nearly 4,000 here in the state of North Carolina. On Friday, we saw the highest number of new cases in one day since July. In the last two days, worst day since July. Yet, the other night Trump said in one of his rallies, “We’ve turned the corner.” And my grandfather would say, “This guy’s gone around the bend if he thinks we turned the corner,”:36)
Yeah, Joe. Joe [inaudible 00:04:39].(04:39)
Turn the corner? Things are getting worse. He continues to lie to us about the circumstances. Experts say we’re likely to lose as many as 200,000 additional lives nationwide between now and the end of the year. All because this President cares more about his Park Avenue perspective on the world, the stock market, than he does about you. Because he refuses to follow the science. It’s estimated that if we just wore masks, if we just wore masks, we’d save between now and the end of the year, a hundred thousand lives. His own head of the CDC said that. And you know what? What’s really sad about this? The President knew how dangerous this virus was all the way back in January.:28)
Yeah.(05:30)
And he hid it from the country. He’s on record. He told Bob Woodward in a taped interview that the disease was deadly, much worse than the flu. And here’s what he did. According to the New York Times three, four days ago, his Administration gave Wall Street investors, a head’s up, but he didn’t tell us, just his friends on Wall Street. That’s why they made so much money by “selling short.” Well who got sold short, y’all got sell short. And you know what’s coming.(06:10)
But what happened to the rest of us? He tried to claim with Woodward, he didn’t want to panic the American people. The American people do not panic, Trump panicked.:23)
Send him home, Joe. Send him home.(06:27)
And his selfish behavior is no surprise. After all, this is the same man who looks at Americans who put their lives on the line for this nation, like so many tens of thousands here in North Carolina have done. Like my son Beau did after a year in Iraq, winning the Bronze Star, conspicuous service medal, he looks at them, he calls them suckers and losers. Who the hell does he think he’s talking about? These are our heroes. They are the people who have sacrificed. They’re the backbone of this country.(06:59)
And now as a consequence of all this overwhelming lying, negligent, and irresponsible action has come, how many chairs were empty at the dining room table last night because of his negligence? Folks, we’re so much better than this. Despite the crisis we face, we have enormous opportunity if we just build. We can build back better. We just got to stand up and take it back. Look, we can build an economy that gets everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead. For example, the communities of color here in North Carolina and across the country. The question is, how do we break that cycle where in good times you lag behind. In bad times, you get hit the hardest and first. And in recovery, the last to bounce back. Well, the answer is about justice, criminal justice, police reform. I know this nation is strong enough to do both, honestly face systemic racism and provide safe streets for our families and small businesses, that too often bear the brunt of looting and burning.(08:04)
We have no need for our armed militias roaming America’s streets. This is the United States of America. And we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacist group marching, menacing our communities. But what, but if you say we have no need face racial injustice in this country, as he says, you haven’t opened your eyes to the truth. There’ve been powerful voices for justice in recent months. George Floyd’s six year old daughter, who I met with in the family. I knelt down to say hi to her. And she looked at me, she said, “Mr. Vice President, daddy changed the world. Daddy changed the world.” Jacob Blake’s mother, with whom I met, said violence didn’t her son and this nation needs healing. And then said she prayed for the police officers.:00)
[inaudible 00:09:00] Joe. Amen.(09:02)
Doc Rivers, a basketball coach, choking back tears when he said, “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung. It’s amazing why we keep loving this country and this country doesn’t love us back.” Think about that. Think about what it takes to be a Black person to love this country today as it does, its deep love for this country. And for much too long it hadn’t been recognized.(09:31)
We need leadership to deescalate tensions, open lines of communication and brings us together. To heal and to hope. As president that’s precisely what I’ll do. But true justice is also about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability. It was right here in Durham, on Parrish Street a century ago that an oasis of black owned businesses thrived, even in the era of Jim Crow. Parrish Street was one of the first examples of flourishing black middle-class community in America. A place that offered the country a glimpse of what we could become if we chose to live up to our founding values. Giving families of color a real shot at a home, start a small business, send a child to college debt free so they can build wealth and pass opportunity down through generations. That’s what built every other middle-class group in America. That’s how we deliver equality and equity.(10:34)
Another example, more and more women are dropping out of the workforce in this recession, whether in cities or in suburbs. I have a plan to deal with this pandemic. Responsibly testing, tracing, masking, not politicizing a race for a vaccine, planning for its safe and equitable distribution. Providing funding for PPE and other resources for schools to reopen safely. Easing the caregiving crisis so many families are experiencing, squeezed between raising your kids and caring for an aging, loved one. And protecting your health care. In the middle of this pandemic, why did Republicans have the time to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court instead of addressing this significant economic needs of local communities?(11:24)
I’ll tell you why. For real not hyperbole, I’ll tell you why. It’s about wiping Obamacare off the books. That’s what it’s about. Because their nominee has said in the past the law should be struck down. If they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose their protections for pre-existing conditions. Complications of COVID-19, over 7 million people infected will become the next preexisting condition, allowing insurers to jack up your premiums or deny your coverage altogether. And women will again be charged more for their health just because they are women. Folks, we can do so much better.(12:07)
I will build on the Affordable Care Act so you can keep your private insurance. You can choose a Medicare like option. We’re going to increase subsidies that lower your premiums and deductibles [inaudible 00:12:18] out of pocket spending. Look, your governor has been working hard to expand Medicaid, but it’s being blocked by Republican legislature. My plan will automatically enroll 357,000 uninsured North Carolinans in a public option for free, automatically.(12:40)
And it’s going to make a life-changing difference for so many families. But we can only do any of this if we come together as a country. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country. A spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I said that from the moment I announced, I’m told that, “Well, maybe that’s you used to be able to do that, Joe. That was your reputation when you were in the Senate and Vice President. But things have changed. They don’t work that way anymore.” Well, I’m here to tell you they can and they will and they must if we’re going to get anything done in America.:14)
We love you, Joe.(13:16)
Folks-:17)
We love you, Joe.(13:18)
I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. No red states, no blue States, just the United States. I promise you. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who did. That’s the job of a president, a duty to care, to care for everyone in America. Folks, and you too have a sacred duty. To vote. And it matters. North Carolina matters. And Senator Harris and I are asking you for your trust and support. We’ll always have your back, I promise you.(13:59)
So please, please vote and help get out the vote. Go to iwillvote.com/nc. Early voting started on Thursday. We got to keep the incredible momentum going. We can’t let up. You can vote early in person until the 31st. But don’t wait, go vote today and don’t just vote for me and Senator Harris. You’ve got a governor’s race, a Senate race, a record number of black women on the ballot. Congress and lieutenant governor. Labor commissioner and the courts. Folks, they’re ready to deliver for North Carolina families. So vote, vote. It’s time. It really is time.(14:43)
When I announced my candidacy, I hadn’t planned on running again to be very blunt. And I’ve said it before. My son had just died and I had no interest. And then I saw those folks coming out of the fields in Charlottesville, carrying torches. Close your eyes, remember what it looked like. They’re veins bulging, shouting anti-Semitic bile. The same bile that was shouted in the streets of Germany in the thirties. Carrying Nazi flags, accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. And a young woman was killed that was protesting the opposite direction. And when asked to comment, this President said something no other president has ever said in the history of the United States of America. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides. Very fine people.”(15:42)
Folks, I mean it when I say this it’s time to restore America’s soul. It’s time to rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class. And this time, bring everybody along. No matter your race, your age, your religion, your gender, ethnicity, or disability. We can do this. The blinders have been taken off the American people and they’ve seen what’s happened. It’s time to unite America. Look, I’ll never forget what President Kennedy said when I was a kid and we’re going to the moon. Every kid in the school had to hear his speech. He used the line in that speech my Senate colleagues and the White House heard me use all the time, it made the most impression on me. He asked the unasked question, “Why are we doing this?” And his response was, he said, “Because we refuse to postpone.”(16:40)
This is America. We refuse to postpone America’s work that must be done.:47)
Yeah, Joe. Yeah, Joe.(16:47)
There’s nothing beyond our capacity. We have never, never, never, never failed. There’s no limit on our future. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. So let’s let them know who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. Science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lies. So folks, it’s time to stand up. Stand up and take back our democracy. No more time left. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

Thanks a lot for being here. I can’t tell whether you’re smiling or not, but thanks for being here. I want to take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about what I think we should be doing right now, and then be happy to take questions. For weeks, we’ve been seeing the warning signs. Numbers don’t lie. Infection rates are now going up in more states than there are going down. More than 125,000 people in the United States have lost their lives, and those numbers and new infections continue to grow at alarming rate. And once again is confronting the simple fact that we won’t be able to solve the economic crisis without a rigorous public health approach. They’re not separable. Despite the administration’s propaganda, that their response should be a cause for celebration, despite President Trump’s requests that we should slow down testing because he thinks it makes him look bad, the COVID-19 is still here, and the daily threat to American health and prosperity is continuing.(01:10)
It didn’t have to be this way. Month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us. Month after month, as many of us urged him to step up and do his job, he failed us. Just look at the record. In January, I, along with others, sounded the alarm of the coronavirus outbreak. Trump told the country that COVID-19 is, quote, “totally under control,” and then everything will, quote, “work out well.” In February, I warned about the failure to get information that we needed from the Chinese government. What I said was the president should demand Xi produce the evidence. Demand it. Trump said, quote, “We’re in great shape.” Reported China’s president said it was, quote, “doing very well.”(02:13)
In March, I set forth a detailed plan for 500 federally funded testing sites across the country, as well as guaranteed emergency paid leave. Later that month, I called for a full and immediate use of the Defense Production Act. Critical, critical for delivering supplies that were basically needed. Trump accused healthcare workers. How did he respond? He accused health workers of stealing your masks. That’s what he said. “Healthcare workers are stealing the masks. That’s why we don’t have them.”(02:47)
In April, I released a plan to secure the supply chain for personal protective equipment, surge nationwide testing through a pandemic testing board, and launch a nationwide health corp to focus on contact tracing. Trump’s suggestions? Americans should inject disinfectants into their bodies. In May, I condemned the false choice between preserving public health and our economy. I urged the administration to focus on the basic public health measures, like testing, that would enable us to sustain our economic recovery. Trump’s response? He pushed for reopening without regard to safety, and called testing, quote, “frankly, overrated.”(03:37)
This month, I outlined a path to reopen our country safely and sustainably. It provided workers, small businesses, schools, state, local governments, the tools, resources, and guidance that they would need. Trump’s proposal, he set a cutoff date for federal funding of testing sites in several states, and actually went to court to take away healthcare for 22 million people by trying to get rid of Obamacare. And now Donald Trump is in retreat. Remember, back in March, when I called, and he called, we talked about the need to act like we were at war with the virus. He called himself a war time president. Remember when he exhorted the nation to sacrifice together, and quote, ” in the face of this inevitable and invisible enemy”? What happened? Now, it’s almost July, and it seems like our war time president has surrendered, waived the white flag, and left the battlefield.(04:48)
Today, we’re facing a serious threat and we have to meet it. We have to meet it as one country, but the president gives no direction, and he pits us against one another. We can’t continue like this. Half recovery, and half getting worse. We can’t continue half wearing masks and half rejecting science. We can’t continue half with a plan and half just hoping for the best. We won’t defeat this virus with a piecemeal approach, lifting restrictions prematurely, increasing the volatility of the crisis, raising the likelihood of needing to reimpose restrictions. Until our science catches up to reality, until we have better treatment for those who become infected, and ultimately are safe, proven, widely available vaccines, we have to continue to do all we can, as the people in the government, to keep our fellow Americans safe and healthy.(05:58)
Today, I’m releasing a plan with the steps I believe Donald Trump should undertake immediately, to build on the roadmap I released back in March that would have saved lives if it had been adopted. It’s a plan to save lives in the months ahead. Once again, I encourage him to adopt this plan and in its entirety. This is too important for politics.(06:26)
First, testing, testing, testing. More testing is not only how you find more cases of coronavirus, Mr. President, it’s how you stop the coronavirus cases. Testing followed by rigorous contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation protocols for those who have been exposed. People aren’t waiting in lines for miles and miles long in baking hot cars for drive through nasal swabs for the fun of it. They’re doing it so they can protect themselves, but even more importantly, they know when they have this mask on, they’re protecting others. They’re protecting others.(07:13)
We know we’re not where we need to be in testing. There are still hospitals and nursing homes that don’t have access to the tests they need. Testing is how we see what’s happening in communities all across the country. It’s our eyes on the ground. Without that testing, we’re flying blind. That’s why it’s so important to have reliable access to testing everywhere. We need to increase federal support for testing. That includes doubling the number of drive through testing sites and keep increasing them until there are no more lines. We should create a pandemic testing board to spearhead a nationwide campaign, so every worker, every worker who’s called back to their job can have the confidence that they and their fellow workers are not infected.(08:08)
Experts agree that we need more contact tracers to track the path of this virus. Individual states like New York and California are already hiring and training thousands of tracers, but we need to do more, including hiring at least 100,000 federally funded workers to perform contact tracing and other public health tasks, and they should begin to be trained now.(08:34)
Second, every single frontline worker should have the personal protective equipment that they need to be safe. Five months into this crisis, and our healthcare workers still are forced to scramble for their own supplies, and have to reuse these masks shift after shift. Hundreds, hundreds of healthcare workers have died from COVID-19, and tens of thousands have become infected. It should be zero on both counts for these healthcare workers if they had the right equipment. You know, how are we this many months into this and still, still don’t have what we need? That’s why we have a Defense Production Act.(09:21)
You know, Mr. President, use your authority, Mr. President. Use it this week. Scale up the production of N95 masks. The steps you’ve taken so far haven’t gotten the job done, Mr. President. Fix the shortage of PPE for our healthcare workers before you tee off another round of golf. We can’t just look at where we are today. We’re going to need these masks and gloves and face shields for the foreseeable future, and we need to be ready. We know more is coming.(09:55)
Thirdly, we should be laser focused on treatments and vaccines. We should be leading a coordinated global approach on the science, not disregarding experts while pushing dangerous and disproved drugs as if they’re treatments. There’s been some progress toward treatment and vaccines, but the administration hasn’t been transparent about how they plan to manufacture enough doses to make sure there’s equitable distribution to scale. I hope they’re doing it now. I called for a while ago, they should be providing $250 million to have a plan now, exactly how they’re going to distribute this, so every American has access when and if the vaccine’s available. They may be doing it, but we have no transparency. Let us see, Mr. President. The White House should report weekly on this progress. We can’t end up in the same scratching and distribution problems that we had in testing.(10:59)
We need to make sure the customers aren’t being gouged by new drug and therapies in prices when they’re developed. We have to immediately restore our relationship with the World Health Organization, for all its shortcomings and missteps around COVID-19. This is why WHO was created. It is essential to coordinating the global response during a pandemic, and the United States should be leading that response as we had in the past. COVID- 19 will likely worsen at the outset of flu season this year, so we need put in place measures now, now, to ensure the seasonal flu vaccine can be ready, available, and administered safely to those who need it under social distancing guidelines, especially for seniors.(11:50)
Fourthly, we need real plans, real guidelines, with uniform nationwide standards, to help us chart our economic reopening. Whatever we’ve been doing now is not working. The state by state approach will only produce confusion and slow any progress. You all reported to CDC, tried to clear guidelines about what stages of reopening should look like. The administration delayed and scaled back those plans. We need clear evidence, clear evidence-based steps that states can adopt now. Both the standard must be met in order to safely proceed with further openings, and the reposition of social distancing rules when cases begin to rise.(12:47)
This is not rocket science. We need to support schools and childcare programs so parents, if and when they can return to work, are confident that their children will be safe and cared for. We should be holding them for-(13:03)
We should be holding and providing a sticker saying, safe for shoppers, a certification to stores that prove they’re minimizing their customer’s risk and exposure. We absolutely needed a clear messages from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public, period. Period. Wear a mask. It’s not just about you. It’s about your family. It’s about your neighbors. It’s about your colleagues. It’s about keeping other people safe. It helps you, yes, but it’s about keeping other people safe. It’s a simple measure. It is also one of the most effective ways we can do the right thing. It may be inconvenient. It may be uncomfortable. But it’s the right thing to do as an American. Protect your coworkers and neighbors.(14:06)
And finally, we need to protect the populations most at risk, our seniors, our black and brown populations, native communities that are being hit the hardest, vulnerable populations with preexisting conditions. Know that this continued growth in case numbers is causing a lot of fear and anxiety. People, especially older Americans and those with loved ones in nursing homes, I get calls all the time. They’re simply scared. They’re frightened. This isn’t just taking a toll on the physical health. It’s an emotional cost as well. We can’t expect vulnerable populations to quarantine indefinitely without support. I want them to know that their health and safety will be my responsibility, if I’m your president. And I will not abandon you.(15:09)
These are five fairly straightforward steps that are going to help defeat this pandemic. And, if you suspect that a lot of these steps are the same sorts of things I was talking about in March when I released my first COVID-19 response, you’d be right. If it feels like you’re hearing the experts talk about the same issues for months, you’d be right. These have always been the steps that government needed to put in place to meet the threat.(15:46)
Statewide lockdowns that so many Americans lived under for months were intended to buy us time to get our act together. Instead of using that time to prepare ourselves, Donald Trump squandered it. Now, here we are, more than three months later. We’re hardly better prepared than we were in March. Infections are on the rise. The threat of massive spikes that overwhelm the capacity of our healthcare system is on the horizon. Americans, anxious and out of work, are fearful for their lives and their livelihoods. Donald Trump is doing next to nothing about it. Mr. President, the crisis is real. The crisis is real and it’s surging, Mr. President. Your promises, and predictions, and wishful thinking pulled out of thin air are not only doing the country no good, you’re making them lose even more faith in their government.(16:57)
America knows this crisis isn’t behind us, even if you don’t. They see what’s happening, even if you refuse to, Mr. President. They know we need a coordinated national plan, we need it now, even though you don’t, Mr. President, and won’t do it. You called yourself a cheerleader. We don’t need a cheerleader, Mr. President. We need a president, Mr. President. A president who will level with the American people, a president who will tell us the unvarnished truth, a president who will take responsibility instead of always blaming others, a president who will listen to the experts, follow the science, allow them to speak, a president who will lead and be an example for the nation. Wear a mask. Keep your distance. Limit the size of crowds. Mr. President, this is not about you. It’s about the health and wellbeing of the American public.(18:06)
American people don’t make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so they could just waste their time and you could waste all the efforts they have undertaken with your midnight rantings and tweets. They don’t make these sacrifices so you could ignore the science and turn responsible steps, like wearing masks, into a political statement. And they certainly didn’t do it, Mr. President, so you could wash your hands and walk away from this responsibility. Maybe there are times this nation needs a cheerleader. Now is not one of them. America needs a president. Whatever Trump does or does not do, we can’t know today what the state of the COVID-19 pandemic will be next January. But I’m almost certain, I hope I turn out to be wrong, I’m almost certain it won’t be over.(19:10)
If I should have the honor of being elected president, on the day I’m sworn in, I’ll get right to work implementing all aspects of the response that remain undone. I’ll have more to say about my day one COVID-19 agenda in the weeks to come. But my response will begin well before I take the oath of office. It will start as soon as the election is decided. I’ll be a president who respects scientists, who won’t censor their ability to speak directly to the American people. I will immediately reach out to Dr. Anthony Fauci to ask him to continue his incredible service to the country. And I’ll have, from day one, ready to go the best medical experts and scientists to advise on our response. Maybe most importantly, I will listen to them and let them speak freely. And I’ll work with the governors and mayors of both parties from every state, territory, and tribe.(20:17)
It’s a simple proposition folks. We’re all in this together. We got to fight this together. We’ll emerge from this stronger because we did it together. And I’m confident we can. May God bless you all and may God protect our troops. And I’m happy to take questions, if you have them.(20:40)
They gave me a list of how to recognize. Is Alex, AP out there? Couldn’t tell when the mask, Alex?47)
[inaudible 00:20:48]. We’ll work with that. All right. So, we reported yesterday that President Trump was briefed as early as March of 2019 that Russia had ordered or offered bounties to the Taliban for the killing of U.S. soldiers. You called his inaction on this issue a betrayal. So broadly, what consequences do you think the president should face for that betrayal? And specifically, what do you think Congress should do?(21:17)
Well, look, first of all, Congress and the intelligence committees on the Congress, both parties should demand the facts. This seems to be a moving story. As I was leaving, I had the television on as I put on my shirt. And I understand there’s even some more information that’s come out today about what was known.(21:41)
One of two things, this president talks about cognitive capability. He doesn’t seem to be cognitively aware of what’s going on. He either reads and/or gets briefed on important issues and he forgets it, or he doesn’t think it’s necessary that he need to know it. But the fact is that, at a minimum, at a minimum, the discrepancy allegedly within the intelligence community as reported, some thought it was more certain and others thought it was less certain. That should be resolved. The president should have, on day one, said, I want you to come before me in the situation room and lay out the differences and discretions. Who is saying what? Let’s get to the bottom of it, number one.(22:38)
Number two, it’s clear to me that, and I don’t know whether he did, he should have immediately contacted our joint chiefs of staff, gotten them all in one room and sat and said, okay. What are we doing to prevent this? What are we doing to prepare to deal with this, if this is happening? How are we doing this? What are we doing?(23:02)
Thirdly, he should, at a minimum, have picked up the phone and said, Vladimir, old buddy, if any of this is true and it doesn’t cease immediately, you’ve got a big problem, a big problem. And make it clear. Get to the bottom of this. It appears as though, from what I have… and I don’t have access to classified information anymore. But, if what I have heard over the last week and the recent reporting that it was in the PDB, the presidential daily brief. The presidential daily brief is something I read every single day as vice president. The president read it every day. I was briefed every morning before I got to the White House, and then again. So, the idea that somehow he didn’t know or isn’t being briefed, it is a dereliction of duty, if that’s the case. And, if he was briefed and nothing was done about this, that’s a dereliction of duty.(24:01)
I guess the best way for me to end this is, I was talking to Jill, my wife, Jill. And I don’t see her get outraged very often. But she started asking. She said, Joe, what would you have done if Beau was still in harm’s way? And this information came out? And the president, Beau is my son who was… I’m sorry, I apologize, who served in Iraq for a year, was in the army. But, if he’d been in Afghanistan, what would you do, Joe? What are those parents thinking out there? What are those sons and daughters, husbands and wives? It’s an absolute dereliction of duty if any of this is even remotely true. So, I think the president has a lot to answer for and we should get the answers quickly, quickly.53)
What consequences should he face if these allegations are true or these reports are true?(24:58)
If these allegations are true and he did nothing about any of this, then in fact, I think the public should, unrelated to my running, conclude that this man isn’t fit to be president of the United States of America.12)
Do you think he… do you-(25:14)
I was told, NBC, Mike. Mike’s great relief, he doesn’t have to follow me every day around the country.23)
Well, the last time, Mr. Vice President, a lot of us saw you on the campaign trail, you were still locked in a very difficult nomination battle. The polls though today show you with a sizeable national lead, a lead in a lot of the states that are critical in the electoral college. I wonder, where do you think the race stands at this moment? What keeps you up at night as you look ahead? And can you maintain this advantage without campaigning in a traditional way, especially this fall when voters begin to really tune in?(25:51)
Well, this is the most unusual campaign, I think, in modern history. But I start off with the premise, Mike, that I’m going to follow the doc’s orders.(26:03)
Off of the premise, Mike, that I’m going to follow the doc’s orders, not just for me, but for the country, and that means that I am not going to be holding rallies. I am not going to be … For example, you all are here, but I think the school has put those circles around, so we keep the social distancing. Everybody has masks on. As soon as I finish this, I’ll put my mask back on. And so it’s all been, almost all been virtual, although I have gone to Houston, I have gone into Pennsylvania, I have gone to Virginia. I have traveled, but when I do, I get in, make my case, and leave, take questions, and leave. But you know me. I’d much rather be out there with people because that’s where I get the greatest feel. I can get a sense of what, by the look in their eyes, by the plaintive voices that they have, and what they’re concerned about.(26:58)
But notwithstanding that, I have been surprised. The irony is we probably reach more people directly on one-on-one. You all, particularly those of you who are with television stations, you all know that when you’re on, you’re having a one-to-one conversation with someone out there because there’s one person at the TV looking at you. I never quite thought of it that way before. But they tell me 200 million people have watched what I have done from home, in the half a dozen things we’ve gone out and done.(27:34)
And so the irony is, I think we’re probably communicating directly in detail with more people than we would have otherwise. But I’d much rather be doing it in person. So far, it remains to be seen, I don’t want to jinx myself. I know the polling data is very good, but I think it’s really early. It’s much too early to make any judgment. I think we’ve got a whole lot more work to do. I’ve planned on laying out in detail my economic plan as to how we recover from this, plan on dealing with foreign … Working out in detail, what I’m going to do if I am elected president so the people know what’s coming. I don’t know that that answers your question, Mike, but-(28:15)
Quick follow-up to Alex’s question first. Have you requested a classified briefing, as you would be entitled to as the nominee? Has the administration offered you a classified briefing? And then-(28:24)
They have not offered a classified briefing. And as this proceeds, I may very well do that. I’ve been talking to … I have a significant foreign policy staff, as you know, that, matter of fact, dozens of them. So I had a long meeting with my former national security advisors, former secretaries of state, et cetera, and got in their read, what they’ve heard so far. But if it doesn’t get cleared up quickly, then I will seek and ask if I can be briefed.(29:00)
Lastly, have you begun to prepare for debates against President Trump?(29:03)
I can hardly wait. [inaudible 00:29:08]08)
Thank you. Over the weekend, Princeton decided to remove Woodrow Wilson’s name from their school and buildings due to his racist thinking. President Trump yesterday called that decision “incredible stupidity.” What do you think about Princeton’s decision and the president’s comments? And then more broadly, as the nation is in this moment of reckoning when it comes to race, we’re seeing the removal of statues, also the removal of names from institutions and schools, do you think that this is the right approach to come to terms with our nation’s history and its leaders? What do you think when you see the removal of some of these statues?(29:49)
Well, I think there are sort of three categories on that. One, any institution that chose a name and wants to now jettison that name, that’s a decision for them to make, for whatever reason they make it. So I’m assuming the board of trustees at Princeton University made the judgment about the Woodrow Wilson School. I don’t know. But it was made within the context of an institution that chose that name and now no longer wants to be associated with that name.(30:18)
And I think the president is …. Well, secondly, I think there’s a distinction between, as the former mayor of New Orleans said, “The difference between reminders and remembrances of history and recovering from history.” And so the idea of comparing whether or not George Washington owned slaves or Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and somebody who was in rebellion committing treason, running, trying to take down the union to keep slavery, I think there’s a distinction there. And so I think the idea of bringing down, I think all those Confederate monuments to Confederate soldiers and generals, et cetera, who strongly supported secession and the maintenance of slavery and going to war to do it, I think those statues belong in museums. They don’t belong in public places.(31:22)
And I think with regard to those statues that are in monuments like the Jefferson Memorial or whatever, I think there’s an obligation that the government protect those monuments because they’re different than that’s a remembrance. It is not a dealing with, revering somebody who had that view. They had much broader views. They may have things in their past that are now and then distasteful, but that’s a judgment for the … For example, taking down, toppling Christopher Columbus statue, George Washington’s statue, or et cetera, I think that is something that is, the government has an opportunity and a responsibility to protect from happening.07)
And on a different subject, you have been doing these public events for the past month, which has put you in contact with more people. Have you been tested for coronavirus, and if so, how frequently are you doing that?(32:20)
No, I have not been protected. I have not been tested for the coronavirus for two reasons. One, I have had no symptoms. As my mother would say, knock on wood. And number two, I haven’t wanted to take anybody else’s place in the process. But the Secret Service, they all get tested. They’re around my home. And anyone who comes into my home, including staff, is tested, just to determine whether they have the virus. I expect what I’m going to do so it doesn’t look like I’m moving in the front of the line here is be tested relatively soon. My daughter has been tested. She was in Florida. She’s a social worker working with the Boys and Girls Club. She came home, and before she could come home, she’s been tested twice, so to make sure she’s clear and quarantined … She lives in Philadelphia. But I haven’t yet. I have not been tested yet.(33:24)
Yes. I’m sorry. Who was I supposed to go to next? Anybody? I got to make sure I get the Wilmington newspaper here before I leave or I’ll be dead.(33:36)
Thank you, Mr. Vice President. It’s good to see you, and I know we all hope that you continue to do this through November as often as possible.(33:44)
We will. The more I have an opportunity, I will do it.(33:47)
Two quick questions. One to follow up on Russia. You talked about what our president has done, but yesterday you said at a fundraiser regarding Vladimir Putin, quote, I’ll confront Putin. I’ll strengthen NATO. I’ll make clear to Putin that he’ll have a price to pay for interference in our democratic processes. Specifically, can you tell us what you would do to Putin? If this is true, and in general, for what’s happened in the past.(34:16)
I can, but I will not … But I will tell him. Here’s the deal. The idea that Putin or any other foreign leader can engage in attempting to manipulate the presidential election, the idea that he continues his activities in Central and Eastern Europe, that he’s doing, the idea that it can be done without any consequences is not going to happen if I’m president in my administration. That ranges from everything to making sure we go to the United Nations Security Council, all the way to imposing sanctions that would be commensurate with the action that he has taken that is inappropriate. But I have had some very blunt, straightforward conversations with President Putin when I was vice president and before that, and I think one of the reasons why it appears as though he doesn’t want me to be president, he knows we’ll have more blunt conversations.(35:14)
And another issue that’s been in the news last week, this week, probably next week, the Supreme Court. President says he’s going to issue an updated list of potential nominees to the court. You have said you would put a black woman on the court, should a spot open up. But there are groups calling for you to release a list of specific names you’d put on the court. Are you going to do that? Would you do that?(35:35)
One thing I hesitate to do is follow anything the president does at all, because he usually does it all wrong. We are putting together a list of a group of African American women who are qualified and have the experience to be in the court. I am not going to release that until we go further down the line of vetting them as well. And just like logical questions about vice president, I’m not releasing the names of all the vice presidential potential nominees. There are a number of women of color. There are Latina women. There are Asian. There are across the board, and we’re just underway now in the hard vet of going into the deep background checks that take anywhere from six to eight weeks to be done. The committees have been formed, and that’s underway.(36:27)
And August 1 is still the target announcement date?(36:29)
Well, early August. I can’t guarantee you August 1, but it will be in early August before, several weeks before the convention, I believe. Yes.(36:45)
Thank you, Mr. Vice president. This is a two-parter, just to follow up again on Russia. Do you believe that if those reports are true that Trump is guilty of violating his oath of office? And on your VP choice, you’ve said that you want your running mate to be ready on day one to do the job. Do you think that someone who does not have national security or foreign policy experience can be ready on day one?(37:14)
Yes. And that depends. Look, one of the things you try to do, I’ve talked at length over the years with President Obama about this. You try to find people who have a background and an expertise that you may not have. And so one of the reasons President Obama picked me is because I had considerable experience in getting things done in the Congress. And secondly, I had considerable experience in foreign policy and national security. And although he had clear views of what in fact he wanted to do and what his standard what his strategy was in terms of America’s role in the world, he was looking for someone that had day-to-day experience and knew a lot of those world leaders. And so I think that, although that’s a helpful thing to have, it’s not necessary because I start off with the two places I still have some expertise are in both those places, in uniting the country and the Congress and foreign policy.(38:18)
And so it is almost all of the women I’m considering have had some exposure to foreign policy and national defense issues and security issues. But that is not a minimum requirement. Requirement is that they have the intellectual capacity, as well as the temperament, as well as the leadership qualities that lend to everyone to believe that they would be ready on day one to be President of the United States of America. With regard to whether or not the president … It depends on exactly what he did and what he knew, but at a minimum, at a minimum, he either does-(39:03)
And what he knew, but at a minimum, at a minimum, either doesn’t understand his job and is having difficulty sitting down and being able to read a report because a lot of those reports come across that he says, “I didn’t read it,” or. “I didn’t see it,” or, “I didn’t know it.” I don’t know how he could not read and not see and not know so many different things that have come up over the last three years. But it is clearly a dereliction of duty and it is clearly something that I think everyone, including my Republican friends and my Republican opponents in the House and Senate are worried about as well. Thank you.(39:45)
All right. Last question.(39:47)
All right. Where’s the Delaware State News? I mean Delaware News Channel I should say. That’s my hometown team. I better call on them.(39:58)
How are you Mr. Vice President?(39:59)
How are you?(40:01)
So like other States, Delaware, your home state, is seeing an increase in coronavirus cases. Do you have a message for Delaware officials, state, and local governments for how they’ve handled the pandemics so far, how they need to handle it going forward?(40:14)
Well, I think they’ve handled it pretty well so far, but now I think you’re seeing the governor make some adjustments because there has been an uptick, not tremendous, but there’s been an uptick. It was one of the states that was, I get briefed up every day by a group of leading docs around the world, around the country, Vic Murphy and Dr. Ben. Anyway. And so every day I get a printout, I have it in the book here, of the states that are doing better and doing worse. Up to now, there has been a decline and now it’s opening up slightly. I have not spoken to the governor today, but my guess is, I’d only guess, is that he’s going to be looking very closely what happens on the Delaware beaches now, how that has occurred and restaurants and bars. I don’t know enough to know that though.(41:08)
The good news is that it’s flattened out. The bad news is there’s a slight uptick and I have not gone into the detail of the governor. I speak to him not infrequently, but a couple of times a month, three, four times a month. And so I don’t have any advice for him yet because I don’t know where it’s popping up.(41:32)
Thank you.(41:32)
Thank you.(41:32)
[inaudible 00:41:33].(41:42)
I’m going to get in trouble. Fire away. I know. Tell them I’ll be late. Just a little bit. Okay? All right?(41:47)
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.(41:48)
I always get in trouble on the last question, but go ahead.(41:51)
We appreciate it. The response to this pandemic has become very politicized. Even wearing a mask has become political. If elected, how are you going to get Americans on the same page? And can your plan be successful if they aren’t?(42:07)
Well, I think the way to get on the same page is to… I’m going to try to say this politely, is to lower the rhetoric based on division. Stop appealing to the less healthy side of society. Instead of, for example, when a golf cart goes by yelling, “White supremacy,” and the president tweets it out, don’t do things like that. Bring the country together. We’re giving a portion of the population who has responded to the sort of race baiting the president has engaged in a sort of free pass and it generates divisions.(43:13)
And we’re also talking about it in terms of the president talks about manhood and being strong and you don’t need the mask. I think we have to start appealing to the better side of human nature by pointing out that that mask is not so much to protect me. It’s if I have it, it’s to protect you against me. It’s to protect other people. And it’s called patriotism. It’s called responsibility. It’s called making sure you look out for the other person. And we have spent too much time, if you notice, the president puts everything in terms of him. And I’m not being facetious, everything is him. It’s I don’t think, or I don’t take responsibility or I didn’t do that, or I believe that. I mean, it’s not about I. It’s about us.(44:10)
And I think changing the tone of an administration across the board, allowing scientists to speak, making sure that people understand the facts, good, bad, and indifferent. And when a mistake is made to say, “I made a mistake, I was wrong. Shouldn’t have done it that way. We should do it this way.” I think all those things change the atmosphere.(44:34)
Let me conclude it by saying this, and I apologize, you’ve heard me say this before. The words of a president matter. No matter who the president is, no matter how responsible or irresponsible the president is. A president, whomever he or she is, can take us to war or bring peace, can have markets rise or fall, appeal to the senior side of humanity or to our better angels. It matters. It really matters. And so I think it’s about the tone. And I think it goes across the board.(45:10)
I’ll conclude with this. I know that I was criticized, legitimately criticized, during the primaries, by saying that I plan on uniting the country, bringing Democrats and Republicans together. We have to do that. If we can’t do that, we can’t function. We have to bring the country together. And I think on this piece, if in fact we stand up, and by the way, don’t hold me to the numbers, please, you can correct me on this, but I think something like 70 or 74 or 75% of the American people think you should wear a mask. The overwhelming number of people think you should take these precautions and so on, think we should open more slowly. Well, I think that we should be talking to our better angels and actually making people indirectly feel guilty for not doing the right thing, appeal to their better nature.(46:10)
I know that sounds almost idealistic, but it’s not. Remind people. You don’t wear this mask, you end up hurting someone or you get infected, you take it home to your child. You can take it home to your mother and your father and your husband, your wife. You have a moral obligation because it really is. It really is. Thank you.(46:35)
Guys, I really do have to go. I apologize. I’m going to get in real trouble. I’m probably already in trouble, but thank you. Go ahead. What’s the last? I’m sorry.(46:48)
Good to see you out and about Mr. Vice President. I’m a little confused about the delineation, about the destruction of monuments. You talk about the fathers of this country, Washington, Jefferson, is worthy of preservation. Are Confederate monuments worthy of preservation? Should they be torn down in the manner that they are being torn down without the vote of local elected officials?(47:08)
Well, I think it’s very different. I think it’s better if they’re taken down like they took the Confederate flag off the Mississippi flag. That’s the better way of doing it, but I can understand. I can understand the anger and anguish that people feel by having for years and years been under the statue of Robert E. Lee, if you’re an African American.(47:32)
So it’s a difference. It’s always better to do it peacefully, but there’s a distinction between. I shift responsibility and I think the elected officials where those statues are have a responsibility to move. Put them in museums, get them down. But don’t expect if you have sitting in front of you after all these years and we finally, finally are going through another phase of maybe responding to the systemic racism in America, and what we’ve seen happen, is don’t be surprised if someone pulls down the statue of Jefferson Davis. It’s better that they do not, but is fundamentally different than pulling down the statue or going to the Lincoln Memorial and trying to pull a… Not Lincoln Memorial. That’s a bad example. The Jefferson Memorial and grabbing Jefferson off his chair.(48:33)
Two quickies. Will you commit to three debates?(48:37)
Oh yes.(48:38)
Three?(48:38)
Three. Yeah. I commit to it. Look, I am committed to following the debate, the National Debate Group that sets up these debates, who they pick as the moderators, three of them. It’s been this way for a long time. The first one is a one-on-one debate with a moderator. The next one is led by a town meeting set and a third one is a normal debate again. I commit to those, I’m looking forward to them.(49:06)
Last question real quick. Some have speculated-(49:08)
You’re a lying dog-(49:09)
That you are subject to some degree of cognitive decline. I’m 65. I don’t have word recollection that I used to have. I forget my train of thought from time to time. You’ve got 12 years on me, sir. Have you been tested for some degree of cognitive decline?(49:25)
I’ve been testing. I’m constantly testing. Look, all you got to do is watch me and I can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I’m running against. Thank you so much.(49:40)
Thank you, guys."

Better not touch it. Hello everybody. It’s great to be here. I just want the record to show that Jim promised, if I get elected president of United States, I can go down to the Houston facility and work and try to drive any this machinery I get a shot at. I used to have a license to drive tractor trailers, but I tell you what, I’m looking at that sucker, that big Caterpillar. That’s a good one. But I’m not sure I want to try that crane, man, that looks awful. That looks awful tough. I know. Well, I’ll tell you what, it’s great to be here.(04:22)
There was an old expression when I was growing up in Scranton, you go home with them that brung you to the dance. And labor brought me to the dance a long, long time ago. They’re the ones who are the operating engineers and the carpenters. Early on, first time that I ran, people who laid the tracks and the pipelines, who operate the cranes and shape the skyline, who build the foundations of everything we rely on. Labor as I said, brought me to the dance, not an exaggeration. And the only reason I’m standing here today as a candidate for president, if it hadn’t been for labor back in 1972, when I was a 29 year old kid, just after Labor Day, I was losing the election. I think it was 54 to 19 going into the election. And then labor came on board. Carpenters across the board, just up and down, operating engineers, the steel workers and we ended up winning by an overwhelming margin of 3,200 votes statewide when Nixon won the state was 68% of the vote. I don’t forget.(05:32)
My dad used to have an expression for real. He said, “The only way to deal with the abuse of power, Joey, is with power. And the only people can take on major corporate interests and the oligarchs who are abusing power, the working men and women are organized labor.” That’s not an exaggeration. The only ones. The only ones. And that’s why I’ve been so supportive of labor my whole career. I’ve never forgotten everything that they’ve done for me, you’ve done for me, but not just for me, but for the country. You are literally not figuratively, the backbone of America. The military is the spine of America, you’re the backbone of America. An awful lot of you served in the military as well. You’re the ones who actually built this country, not Wall Street bankers and CEOs. You built the country and you’re going to build it and you’re going to build it back better than it was before.(06:32)
And I want thank Jim. I want to thank President Callahan and his team as well as the folks in Local 66 for welcoming me here today and giving us an inside look at everything you’re doing to rebuild and energize Western Pennsylvania. I’m from Eastern Pennsylvania. I’m from up in Lackawanna County in that valley and a lot’s going to happen here. I am so confident. I really am that we’re not only coming back, we’re going to come back big. I mean hardworking folks. I want to thank Vice President Frank Spencer and the carpenters for all they do as well. I’m honored, the trust you’ve placed in me and I want to thank you a lot for it. And if I have the honor of becoming president, I’ll be fighting for you every single day. And I promise you, hear me now, you will have a seat at the table at the White House. No fundamental decisions will be made without you sitting in literally not figuratively. Literally, that’s a word. You have my word on it.(07:31)
And folks, I’ve been on a train today. I’ve traveled, it’s kind of like going back home. I traveled over 2,100,000 miles over 40 years on Amtrak going back and forth every single solitary night to see my kids. A 250 mile round trip. But we came today, we on an Amtrak train, do a whistle stop tour. We started off in Cleveland, across Ohio, into Western Pennsylvania. And riding the rails reminds me of when I would take the train home from Wilmington to Washington and back every night. And I used to go back when you get through round the beltway, going into Baltimore, you go through a number of middle class neighborhoods like houses like I grew up in. Three bedroom split level homes, that kind of thing.(08:19)
And I used to literally, when we’d have debates on the floor of the Senate, look out that window and I’d sit there and I’d see the lights on and the homes we were passing just like we saw coming from Cleveland into Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh to here. And I’d wonder, do they have the same kind of conversations at that table that my mom and dad had at our table? Are they having the same kind of conversations the guys I grew up with, the women I grew up with had? No honey, we can’t get four new tires on the car. We can’t afford it, we got to wait another month. Literally not figuratively, literally. Or, I know we need a new hot water heater. We can’t afford it. We got to wait. It’s going to take a little while longer.(09:08)
You have vast majority of the middle class saying before we got into this recession. If they got an unexpected bill for $400 in a month that they didn’t expect, they’d either have to borrow the money or put it off. They’re neighbors I grew up in. You’re the only ones that saved them from people from having to do that if in fact you’re able to have work. Folks, I knew all those families inside and those families and on that route today. I didn’t know their names, but I know what’s on their minds. What their concerns were. They’re not looking for a handout, all they’re looking for is a hand up. My dad used to say, “Joe, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure in heck expect them to understand my problem.” We’re not understanding the problems of the vast majority of Americans today. All they’re looking for as a fair shot and a little bit of dignity and a little bit of respect instead of being looked down on so that the parents could look their kids in the eye and say, “Honey, everything’s going to be okay.”(10:22)
My dad used to have that expression. After we left Scranton, he had to move to Delaware and commute every day for over a year and finally be able to get us down. Not every day, once a week, come back every week. And finally, we got apartment in Claymont Delaware. A little steel town, has no more steel now. And then we finally ever got a home four years later. But it’s what a lot of people we’re still going through. There’s a stark difference from what I saw last night on the debate stage. An entitled self serving president who inherited everything in his life and squandered it. A president who calls his own supporters, according to some staff members, his own supporters, disgusting. Who thinks that folks who put their lives on the line for our country in the military are losers and suckers. It’s despicable.(11:33)
I’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life. The guys who might let you park the cars at their country club, pick up a few bucks but even if you had the money, wouldn’t let you join the country club because of your religion or because of your background. Guys who stiff contractors, building their hotels and their golf courses, just to put a few more bucks in their pocket, seems to take some joy in it. Guys who think the rules don’t apply to them. Guys and make tens of millions of dollars and pay $750 in federal taxes in a year.(12:17)
Donald Trump sees things from Park Avenue. I see him from where I grew up in Scranton and Claymont. My mom, Jean Finnegan Biden had a backbone like a ramrod, all five foot one of her. And my mom used to have an expression. I really mean it. I used to be a stutter and it’s when you’re a stutter you’re used to bullies. It’s easy to make fun of somebody who talks like that. That’s how I learned to fight. Joke used to be, Biden’s like shoe leather. You can beat him, but he’s going to hurt you. You have to stand up to these folks. Well, my mom would say, “Joey, look at me, look at me. Remember, nobody is better than you, nobody, but everybody’s your equal.” And she meant it. She meant it. As I said, my dad’s expression when we moved to Delaware was he’d talk about how a job is a lot more than about a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.(13:30)
Those values shaped my whole life. If you look back on my career, you notice it shaped my whole career, my Build Back Better plan. It shaped my views as president what I’ll do. It’s all about giving communities like Greensburg and New Alexandra and Claymont and Scranton and places in parts of Cleveland I just came out of, giving women and men who work on pipelines and construction sites a fair shot. We’re going to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure, including more than 50 billion in one year to get to repairing our schools, our highways, our bridges, revitalizing our locks and our dams, making our inland waterways the finest in the world. That’s what attracts businesses. That’s what brings employment. You talk about how much my plan costs. Well, guess what? Those investments are going to create millions of high paying jobs. Building a modern infrastructure and a durable energy future. And I promise you this, in my administration, collective bargaining, now hear me, collective bargaining will be sacred. It’s a guarantee. A guarantee. And union apprenticeships, union apprenticeships will be sacred. Last thing we need is corporate America taking over apprenticeships programs like they tried to do.(14:58)
We’re going to stand up for prevailing wage and benefit productions and the Davis Bacon Act. I guarantee. You may recall the president, he used to like to surprise me at State of the Union addresses says, “And Sheriff Joe will take care of the Build Back.” we didn’t call it Build Back Better, it was Recovery Act $800 billion. Not a single project was not prevailing wage. It’s a guarantee, every single solitary project we built. And so folks, we’re going to level the playing field for you and for your families. We’re going to have wages and benefits. We’re going to lower healthcare cost, prescription drug prices. We’re going to take on the opioid crisis for real, with effective treatment. Making four years of public college universities, apprentice programs, tuition free, anybody making less than $125,000 a year if they go to a state university, they go to a community college it’s automatic. If they’re in an apprentice program, it’s going to be free.(16:07)
My wife has an expression. She’s a community college professor, “Any country that out educates us will out compete us.” The cost is staggering for people having to carry the burden. And we’re going to do it without asking anyone who makes under $400,000 a year to pay one more penny in taxes, guaranteed, my word on it, because what we’re going to do, we’re going to get rid of the God awful $2 trillion tax cut that Trump passed. 1.4 trillion of it going to the top 1%, a significant portion of that going to the top 1/10th of 1%. We’re going to start rewarding work, not wealth. We’re going to make sure corporations began to pay. The Fortune 500 companies, 91 don’t pay a single penny in taxes and some of them make multi-billion dollars. How about your taxes? You pay nothing in taxes?(17:07)
We’re not going to punish anybody, everybody’s going to pay their fair share. Look, a lot of people around here voted for Donald Trump last time. I get it. I understand why. I’ve been asked many times in recent years, “How do we get to a place where the people who teach our kids, take care of our sick, build our bridges, operate our cranes, who race into burning buildings and don’t ask who’s in the other end there, whether you’re black or white or Muslim or Christian, people who in fact grow our food, how do we get to a place where they don’t think we don’t see them? Or hear them? Or respect them?” Well, I see them. I hear them. I respect them. I know them. They’re family and it’s going to change. It’s going to change with me. Look, this is not a partisan moment. This is an American moment. And I mean that seriously. Think about it.(18:10)
We have a chance to put the anger and division that has overtaken this country behind us. We can be what we are at our best. One people, one America. We just need to remember who in God’s name we are. This is the United States of America. Think about this. Never once in our history, when we’ve set our mind to it, have we not been able to accomplish whatever we set our mind to do when we’ve done it together. There’s not a single thing we can’t do. And with your help, I’m going to get elected. And with us working together, I promise you. I promise you, it’s going to be a different America. We again, reward work not just wealth. Where people are treated with decency.(19:05)
I’ll conclude by saying, a president’s words matter, no matter how good or bad a president is, the words they utter matter and can take us to war. They can bring peace, they can make the market rise or fall, they can change people’s lives. And this president has breathed hate and division under the rocks here. Hate only hides. It doesn’t go away. And it matters what presidents say. And you heard what he said last night, when he was asked by the moderator, “Will you condemn white supremacy?” And he fuddled around didn’t say anything. I said, “How about the Proud Boys?” And he said, “Well,” the context he likes he said, “just tell them to stand down and stand by.” Go online. Look up Proud Boys they’ve got a new emblem now, literally. It says, “Stand down and stand by.” Implying that if he loses the election, something may have to be done. I promise you that won’t happen. The American people are going to speak. They’re going to speak in large numbers and nobody is going to get in the way of our democratic process going forward. Nobody, period.(20:47)
This is the United States of America. We’re not as some tin horn, dictator shepherded, third world country. This is the United States of America. I want to thank you all for your endorsements. I really mean it. Means a lot to me personally, just on a personal level I appreciate it. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you so very much."

Hello, hello, hello, hello. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It’s good to be back in Erie. I want to say hello to all of Erie. But mainly Mr.Mayor, City Council President Horton, and all local elected leaders who are joining us here today. And to your next Senator, Julie. We need to turn out and support for Democrats down the line here in Pennsylvania and win back that Pennsylvania state Senate. Folks, look. I want to thank you President McManus for coming out, you’ve been a good friend a long time. And for everyone at the UA for hosting this incredible training facility. I’m so grateful to have earned UA’s endorsement. You have over 355 proud plumbers, pipe fitters, and more behind me then I can possibly thank you for.(00:58)
Also, want to thank Rick for sharing his story with us today. And for being part of a conversation this year where he shared a story with America. And Rick, Delaware is thought of as being a great corporate entity, and chemical facilities, and all those things. But we have a $4 billion, as you probably well know, agricultural industry in the Delmarva Peninsula. It’s a big deal and a lot of farmers are being hurt really badly, really badly. Farmers all across the country have been gutted by the president’s broken promises and reckless trade war. But our farmers, just like our union members and anyone who actually does an honest day’s work, see him and his promises for what they are. Rick, I want to thank you. And I think you put it best in the op-ed you wrote last year. You said, “It’s a bunch of hot air and cold wind.”(01:55)
Folks, this is it. Election’s here. The choice couldn’t be more stark. The stakes couldn’t be higher. So many Pennsylvanians are facing hard times right now. After my debate in Cleveland last week I took a train. That’s what I’ve ridden a lot, an Amtrak train. From northeastern Ohio into Pittsburgh and Greensburg, Latrobe, Johnstown. And I heard the same stories everywhere, I’ve been hearing all around the country. You’re trying your best but it never feels like enough. You’re not looking for a handout. You’re just looking for a fair shot. That’s how my dad felt when we had to leave Scranton after it was no work, when coal died. He was in sales, he wasn’t a guy who was in the coal mines. Although my great-grandfather was, they tell me, the first Irish Catholic State Senator ever elected in the state of Pennsylvania, and he was a mining engineer. But I remember him saying he made that walk, which a lot of you know here in Erie.(02:59)
I call it the longest walk any parent has to make up a short flight of stairs to tell his kids we can’t play in that ball camp, can’t play in Green Ridge Little League anymore. You can’t go to St.Paul’s, you got to leave. Dad doesn’t have a job. I’m going to have to leave. I remember him taking us home, my mom and three children at the time, home to my grandpop’s. And I don’t know how much pride it must’ve cost him to ask my grandfather, “Will you take care of Jean and the kids? I’ll be back.” And he started commuting every weekend 157 miles down to Delaware where he had grown up. We ended up in a steel town called Claymont, Delaware. Then we went to Wilmington. My dad got a sales job and he worked hard. Took about four years to build a decent middle class life and be able to buy a home.(03:46)
But it wasn’t easy for him, but he had an expression. He said, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I at least expected them to understand my problems.” America deserves a president who understands what people are going through. You’re facing real challenges right now. And the last thing you need is a president who exacerbates them. More than 210,000 are dead, as was pointed out. We lose anywhere from 700 to a thousand people a day, dead. The president was told a little while ago… When he was told a 100,000 people a day were dying, you know what he said? He says, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. More than 7.5 million Americans have been infected, and counting. 175,000 cases right here in Pennsylvania. My heart goes out to all those families who, like any of us have lost a child’s spirit, look at that empty chair at the dining room table tonight where somebody you love used to sit.(04:53)
My heart goes out to everyone struggling in this economic crisis. Simple neglect on the part of this administration. There’re 11 million jobs lost since the beginning of this crisis and still have not come back. Temporary layoffs have turned into permanent layoffs. We’re still down 674,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started, and more than 40,000 manufacturing jobs here in Pennsylvania. The Trump presidency will be the first presidency since Hoover that is going to end up leaving office with fewer jobs than when he came into office. Since Hoover. But President Trump has laid… He talks about this V recovery. We went down real quick, we’re coming up quick. Well, that’s what you call a K-shape recovery. Those folks on the top of the K are doing very, very well. Recession at the top, those folks, everything’s going up for them. But everybody in the middle and below is going down, seeing things get worse.(05:57)
It means essential workers who sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in American history. And it means while the top… This is a fact, which is startling to me when I found it out. The top 100 billionaires, in the middle of this pandemic they made $300 billion additional dollars. Hear me now? 100 individuals made $300 billion this year. And what’d the bottom half get? They got the K, they got the slide down. Because the fact is, the President can only see the world from Park Avenue. I see it from Scranton. I see it from Claymont, for real. You all know what I’m talking about. You all see it from Erie. That’s why my program to build back better is focused on working people.(06:53)
Think about it. Think about all the people you know who got up this morning and had the following conversation. “Honey, I know we need four new tires, they’re bald. But we can’t do it now, we got to wait. You got to wait.” Or “I know we just lost our insurance, but we’re going to be okay. We’re going to hang in there.” Or having to make a choice, literally a choice, between getting the prescription or putting food on the table. If I said to that 10 years ago you’d look at me like I was writing a fiction story, but that’s the truth. Those are decisions people are making today, right now.(07:34)
Independent analysis put out by a highly respected Wall Street firm of all things, Moody’s from Wall Street firm, projects that my build back better plan’s going to create 18.6 million jobs in four years. That’s harder now. That’s not a liberal think tank, that’s Moody’s. And it’s going to create seven million more jobs than the president’s economic plan. And a trillion dollars more in economic growth than the president’s plan. And here’s how it works, I’m going to raise taxes. I’m not going to raise taxes on anybody making less than $400K, but you won’t pay a penny more. But those making more than that, I’m going to ask them to finally begin to pay the fair share. I’m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay. 91 of the fortune 500 companies today pay zero tax. You hear me? Zero tax. How many of you pay zero tax? And billionaires are paying at a tax rate… Because it’s all investment money, they’re paying a lower tax rate than you pay if you have a job as a plumber.(08:46)
How can that be? So I’m going to raise. The money I’m going to raise, we’re going to allow us to invest in working people and grow the middle-class back, and make sure everyone comes along this time. My plan is about making the kinds of investments that are going to stimulate economic growth. To get it back to full employment fast and help us build back better than before. We’re going to create millions of good paying union jobs. I had the honor of being the guy in charge of the Recovery Act when the Great Recession occurred. The president turned to me, he used to love doing it at State of the Union messages. He’d never tell me what he was going to do. And he turns, says “And Joe, sheriff Joe’s going to take care of that $800 billion.”(09:28)
Well, we got it done less than two tenths of 1% waste or fraud. And we built back the longest expansion in American history. Manufacturing and technology, making sure we’re going to make the future made in America. And infrastructure, building: airports, schools, affordable housing, upgrading the water and pipes. Making sure it’s sustainable and resilient, built, laid down by union plumbers and pipe fitters here in Pennsylvania and across the country. And clean energy, we’re going to upgrade four million buildings with weatherization of two million homes. And it’s estimated that’ll create one million good paying jobs, union jobs. Union jobs to be filled by men and women like in this local here. Look folks, we’re in a situation now where if you take a look at this build back better… I’m going to take a second. But I hope I don’t take too many seconds before it rains here.(10:28)
Number one, we were talking about it, Mr.President, a little while ago. He promised an infrastructure plan in 2016, ’17, ’18, ’19. He didn’t do a damn thing. Not one single bit. He promised to relieve main street slammed by the recession. But guess where that money went, that the Congress passed? It went into the Mar-a-Lago crowd, the wealthy. See, I’m not joking. It didn’t go to small businesses. It didn’t go to the people that needed it. My plan to revitalize American manufacturing infrastructure says we’re going to use by American. We’re supposed to be only buying American now.(11:07)
Well, I’m going to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure and clean energy. We’re going to raise over $3.7 trillion by eliminating that tax cut for the super wealthy. And folks, we’re going to: fix water pipes, pipelines, replace lead pipes, upgrade treatment plants. We’re going to construct 1.5 million new affordable housing units. We’re going to build a $100 billion dollars rebuilding our schools. We’re going to retrofit, which we started in our administration, 4 million buildings; including advanced heating and cooling system. There’s going to be such a race to job creation for unions that you’re not going to believe it, and I really mean this. And by the way, when I did the Recovery Act, which is $800 billion, not one… We had the largest infrastructure project short of Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway Program; since that.(12:00)
Not one single solitary dollar went to anything other than a prevailing wage. Had to be a prevailing wage. Look, I’m also going to make sure that corporate America being so kind, wanting to take over registered apprenticeships… You know what that’s all about? You guys spend a quarter billion dollars a year making sure that you have apprenticeships that are the best trained people in the world. Well folks, I’m also going to pass the PRO Act. They’re spending over $2 billion a year trying to keep you from being able to organize around the country. That’s a promise. And also strengthen labor standards, especially OSHA rules. There’s a lot we can do, but it’s not enough to praise workers. We got to make sure they get benefited.(12:45)
Folks, look, my dad had another expression. After he lost his job, we moved to Delaware. He’d say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.'” The fact is that every time the word climate change comes up Donald Trump thinks hoax. Every time it comes up, I think jobs. Let me be clear, no matter how many lies he tells, I am not, not, not banning fracking; period. We’ll also increase incomes. We’re going to see the burden and the cost with an increased 50, we’re going to make sure. Not prevailing wage. We can’t mandate that, you guys. By the way, I said inside, the other expression my dad had was, “There’s only one way to deal with the abuse of power.” Which corporate America is exercising now. “It’s with power.” And the only power we have is union power. You’re the guys that keep the ball bearings on the other side of the gate from taking everything, and that’s a fact.(13:56)
So look, I’ll try to move along quickly here. The fact is that we not ease the burden on the major costs in your life. What’s the average middle-class person fear most? They’re trying to tear down the Affordable Care Act. We’re going to build on it, adding a new health insurance option. A not-for-profit public option, which is going to give private insurers real competition. We’re going to increase the subsidies so premiums are lower and we can afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses. Because we’re going to be able to do that with the money we take back from the super wealthy. We’re going to take on the pharmaceutical companies with a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60%.(14:39)
Look folks, we’re going to work with states to ensure that every three, four, and five year old has access to free high quality preschool, not daycare. You send them to preschool, there’s evidence of 58% of them will go all the way through. No matter what their background. No matter what poor school, poor neighbor they come from. You start them at age three, they have a 58% better chance of graduating all the way through high school and beyond. We’re going to make sure the low and middle income families will never have to spend more than 7% of their income caring for their young. What’s the comp… Talk to the women around here. I was a single dad for five years. I couldn’t afford help. I thank God I had my mom, and my sister, and my brother to help me with my kids when my wife and daughter were killed.(15:24)
We’re going to make four year public college and universities tuition free for families making less than $125,000 a year. And when Erie gets his first new community college to open in Pennsylvania in 27 years, we’re going to make sure that it’s free for anyone who qualifies to get in. That’s a fact. And by the way, that costs a lot of money. That costs $6 billion a year. That’s about as much as we give a tax deduction for race horses. I mean this, we got to have priorities.(15:55)
If you’re buying your first home? Look at all people who’ve gotten out of school since the 9/11 generation. Where they got out of high school without a graduation. Where they got out of college, no graduations. Where they thought they had these good jobs waiting for them, but they all got shut down in the Great Recession. And now, what are they doing? They’re unable to make that first home down payment. They’re out there busting their neck. And a lot of them are college graduates, some of them are beyond that. Some of have their graduate degrees and no jobs, or no access. Well, I’m going to make sure you get a tax credit for up to $15,000 for your first time home buyer; period. That’s going to provide you a down payment. We’re going to protect social security, increase benefits for millions of seniors. So he can retire with dignity in some respect.(16:40)
Folks look, but if we’re going to get anything done, we’ve got to come together. We’re going to have to vote like we’ve never voted before. Early voting is open here in Pennsylvania. So go vote if you can. And go to IWillVote.com/pa to find out when and where you can vote early. And if you requested a mail in ballot, return it as soon as possible. Make sure you seal it first in the secrecy envelope, and then sign the declaration on the outside of the envelope before you return it. As I said early this week on the sacred grounds of Gettysburg battlefield, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. I’m going to work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do.(17:34)
And I’m so proud in this campaign to have earned the support of so many proud and patriotic Republicans, including Pennsylvania’s former governor and secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge. I want to thank him publicly for his endorsement. We may not in everything. We agree on this. This is a moment to put country above party. Because after all this country’s been through, after all that America has accomplished, after all the years we’ve stood as a beacon for the rest of the world. It cannot be that here in the year 2020 we’ll allow the government of the people, by the people, and for the people, to perish on this earth; as Lincoln said. We can do better. We can do better than what we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America.(18:24)
All this division being pushed by this president, all this stuff about encouraging… Here in the debate we had I ask him to condemn the Proud Boys. He said, “Stand back and stand down, but stand ready.” What’s going on here? This is not who we are. This is not who we are as a country, for real. We can argue like hell, but end of the day we come together. I am more optimistic about America’s chances today than I ever been. Why? Because I think the blinders have been taken off, people have realized what’s really at stake here. I think we can pull this together. I’m optimistic. I really genuinely am.(19:06)
But here’s the deal guys, we got to go out and make sure you vote. Because, the only way we lose this is by the chicanery going on relative to polling places. This whole idea… Not a single solitary reasonable person in either party has said mail-in ballots are corrupt. No evidence, but he’s trying to make it sound that way. Trying to put people in polling places. The same guys you saw standing blocking people’s way in Virginia with banners and rifles slung across their shoulders. Folks, it’s not who we are. We’re so much better than this. So I say to you all, God bless you all. Let’s go out and vote. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. Where am I going? Am I going this way? Thanks everybody. See you pal, thanks a million. Thank you! The other way, [inaudible 00:20:11]."
biden_speech_press1.txt,"(01:53)
Folks, welcome to the Queen Theater. I’m here today to talk about a crisis, a crisis being felt all across the United States of America. And Jill and I have just been briefed, as you know, in this room, by our public health and education experts about what it’s going to take to be able to reopen our schools safely and effectively.(02:23)
And back to school has always been a special time [inaudible 00:02:26] your families and mine, but particularly in mine because for all the years Jill and I were married, she was going back to school too as a teacher. Jill’s an educator and she’ll be the first one to tell you that this should be a season of promise for our country, times when classrooms are crackling with the possibilities of the new year, students’ hopes, and all about the future.(02:54)
But this year, we’re facing the most difficult circumstances and we’re seeing an awful lot of heart and a lot of grit from our educators, our students to try to rise to the occasion here, but our government hasn’t come up to that bar. They haven’t shown much grit at all or determination.(03:12)
Let me be clear. If President Trump and his administration had done their jobs early on with this crisis, America’s schools would be open and they’d be open safely. Instead, American families all across this country are paying the price for his failures and his administration’s failures.(03:34)
Like many of you, because you’re all reporters, you also have a lot of friends and you have children, and you’re probably hearing the same thing I’m hearing throughout this pandemic. They’re struggling to figure out how to do the right thing, but they’re worried. They’re worried like the devil. “What does it mean for my kids? Is this setting my child’s education back beyond just a semester? What impact will it have? How’s my child going to catch up? What if I’m not doing enough to help my child succeed?” All those questions, the self-doubt that’s been engaged. President Trump may not think this a national emergency, but I think going back to school for millions of children and the impacts on their families and the community is a national emergency. I believe that’s what it is.(04:27)
Protecting our students, our educators, our communities, getting our schools open safely and effectively, this is a national emergency, but President Trump still doesn’t have any real plan for how to open our schools safely, no real plan for how to help parents feel secure for their children. He’s offering nothing but failure and delusions.(04:54)
From the start to finish, the American families and our children are paying the price for his failures; failure to take this virus seriously early on in January and February and it spread around the globe, failure to take steps we needed back in March and April to get this pandemic under controlled institute widespread testing and tracing to control the spread, failure to provide clear national science-based guidelines to state and local authorities, and failure to model even basic responsibility like socially distancing and wearing a mask, and failure to make sure educators and administrators have the equipment, the resources, and the training they need to open safe and under the circumstances we find now.(05:44)
Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos, Secretary DeVos, haven’t stepped up and we’re all seeing the results. Millions of students are now starting the new school year in the same way they finished the last one, at home. At home. Parents are doing their best, but more and more, were finding themselves at wit’s end, struggling to balance work and childcare and educational duties, or worrying about their lost paycheck and how they’ll make ends meet while trying to keep their kids on track with remote learning.(06:23)
Educators are taking on countless hours of additional training to learn how to use remote learning tools so they can still be there for their students, but they’re worried about all the kids who used to count on our schools, all those children who need it so badly, and particularly those children who need more than the education and they provide their meals and safe places to spend the day.(06:51)
You know, we’re all concerned about making sure COVID-19 doesn’t further exacerbate the disparities, the disparities that already have existed in our educational system for so many poor children and in so many communities of color. It’s unacceptable and it can’t go on like this. We all want our schools to reopen safely with a plan that prioritizes the health of our students and our educators and staff alike.(07:19)
I laid out my plans back in June and July, a roadmap for how to open and reopen safely and effectively. You can read them by going to JoeBiden.com. We need straight forward common sense solutions, but Trump refuses to act, starving schools have the needed funding, funding they need now. Now. They needed it beginning of the summer. Now, Trump’s FEMA director is cutting schools loose. Just yesterday, FEMA announced that after helping three districts, I think it was three, they announce that they’re not going to help pay for cloth masks, other PPE for school settings, cleaning, those basic health needs, or sanitize, everything from the lavatories to the classrooms, and safety costs for schools that don’t qualify for emergency assistance.(08:19)
This is emergency, Mr. President. This is an emergency. And Donald Trump and his FEMA should treat it as one.(08:28)
If I were president today, I’d direct FIM to make sure that our kids K through 12 get full access to disaster relief and emergency assistance under the Stafford Act. I’d make sure that PPE and sanitation supplies for school qualify as emergency protective measures, which is a phrase they use, to fully be eligible for federal assistance.(08:52)
On top of that, I’d be working with the leaders of Congress now, today, to pass emergency packages for schools so they have the resources they need in order to be able to open safely, money for ventilation. I heard that a lot when I had all those health care experts up on the Zoom. Money for ventilation and other health measures, but also more money to hire more teachers. Every recommendation we got was they should be dividing into pods, smaller classes. Smaller classes mean more educators are needed. Keeping classes socially distanced, small. Money for more psychologists and counselors. I introduced legislation a long time ago calling for [inaudible 00:09:42] I proposed legislation a long time ago.(09:46)
We have one school psychologist for every 1,507 children in school. And the healthcare, the mental health that our children need now, the anxiety they’re feeling at home in going to school, not being able to-(10:03)
… at home, in going to school, not being able to go to school, the nation’s superintendents of schools have estimated that they’ll need at least $200 billion to support K through 12 schools throughout the year for safe reopening. And we need the money to hire educators as well for our four-year colleges and universities, for community colleges, for HBCUs, for minority-serving institutions. Democratic leaders are ready to get this done. They’ve already proposed legislation. Mr. President, where are you? Where are you? Why aren’t you working on this? We need emergency support funding for our schools and we need it now. Mr President, that’s your job. That’s your job. That’s what you should be focused on now. Getting our kids back to school safely. Keeping schools safely able to remain open once they open. Not whipping up fear and division.(11:08)
Not inciting violence in our streets. Get off Twitter and start talking to the congressional leaders in both parties. Invite them to the Oval Office, the Oval Office, and stop your boast about never being seemed at what you can do anything. You always talk about your ability to negotiate. Negotiate a deal. A deal for somebody other than yourself. Now I’m happy to take questions you may have, I guess staff’s going to call on whoever. Follow, fire away. (12:17)
I think we should let the judicial system work its way. I do think there’s a minimum need to be charged, the officers, and as well as Breonna Taylor and I might add, by the way, I think what happened in Portland where one of the Trump guys riding along in vans and inciting responses were shooting rubber bullets, I guess, or paint balls. Apparently there was someone shot by someone in the crowd with a bullet, killed. I think that person should meet legal requirements, whatever that calls for. He should be investigated and it should follow through on what needs to be done. Let the judicial system work. Let’s make sure justice is done. (13:45)
I’m not going to speculate on what it means always, but I can say is that nothing this administration does is normal. And so I’m not being facetious when I say that. So who in God’s name knows what it was all about? I just don’t know. I don’t know. And I’m not going to speculate. I’ll let the experts do that. And so, and the only time that I have been on notice is when the president’s out of the country and I’m in the country, that not that I should wait for something to be immediately be aware of anything, but that’s something that might be called for. It wasn’t called for. (15:00)
Well, I have already spoken to all the leaders up there and although I have an outstanding call with the governor who we’ve dealt with the staff because, and there’s been overwhelming requests that I do come. Because what we want to do is we’ve got to heal. We’ve got to put things together, bring people together. And so my purpose in going will be to do just that, to be a positive influence on what’s going on, talk about what need be done and try to see if there’s a beginning of a mechanism to bring the folks together.(15:40)
We have to heal. This is about making sure that we move and we move forward. And so I’ve gotten advice from sitting members of the Congress and the Senate as well to go and that I should go. I’m not going to do anything other than meet with and meetings with community leaders, as well as business people and other folks in law enforcement. And to see, to start to talk about what has to be done. I’m not going to tell Kenosha what they have to do but we have to do together. The idea that we are saying the president’s current people retreat to their corners and keep this movie is just a mistake. I spent my whole life, including in this city you’re in right now, bringing people together. Bringing the community and police officers together. Bringing business leaders and civic leaders together. And so that’s my purpose in going. (17:12)
Well, I think my message is getting out based on what the polling data shows and the millions of people who’ve watched, what I’ve had to say and the circumstance which I’ve said it. But I would like to get out more. But I think a president has a responsibility to set examples, set the right example for how to get out. Not go out and not wear a mask and not to have large crowds of people standing next to one of their not wearing masks, not being a potential called room for significant outbreaks of COVID. And so what I’ve done is I’ve met with, via what I did this morning with the medical experts.(17:58)
And so we’ve worked out a protocol where, how I get in the plane, what kind of plane I get on, how it’s sanitized, how I engage people. It’s like when I’m engaging all of you everywhere I go. It’s always at a safe distance and everybody’s wearing masks. And the vast majority of people that I’m meeting with have been, had come into my home and staff and the like, they’re all tested as well. So I’m just trying to set the example, wearing the protective gear, the mask, which I have with me. I’m able at this distance to take it off, number one. Number two, making sure that we proceed in a way with adequate social distancing and do it the right way. (18:58)
Well, I began to prepare by going over what the president has said, multiple lies he’s told. What I’d love to have as a crawler at the bottom of the screen of fact checker when we speak. If we really want him to do something, I think that would make a great, great debate. If everything both of us said was instantly fact-checked by an agreed to group of people out there then we move forward. But probably wouldn’t get very far in the debate. Now I’m looking forward to debating the President and I’m going to lay out as clearly as I can, what I think we have to do to bring this country back and build it back better. And I’m looking forward to the debate. (20:15)
First of all, I wouldn’t incite violence. I condemn it when it occurred. I would move to, look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable women and men. They pin on that shield every morning and they have a right to go home that night safely. The vast majority. But just those who are not good cops, all the police I’ve dealt with my whole life, and I’ve been dealing with, I’ve gotten overwhelming support from law enforcement through my whole career. They’re the ones that want to get rid of the bad cops, even more than anybody else does because it reflects on them. Number one. Number two, I would make sure everybody understood, if I were president, that any violence, any violence, protesting is a right and free speech is a right, but to engage in violence, burning, looting, the rest, in the name of protesting is wrong, and that persons should be held accountable for their actions.(21:20)
What I’d be doing is I’d be bringing people together in the White House, right now. I’d be having that Police Commission set up. I’d have law enforcement at the table. I’d have the community at the table. I’d have people and saying, “How do we get through this? What do we do to deal with this?” Because I believe the vast majority of the community at writ large, as well as law enforcement, want to straighten things out, not inflamed things, but this president keeps throwing gasoline on the fire, every place he goes.(21:50)
I noticed, and I didn’t watch much of it, but I watched the reports from all of you, not all, I from the press. When he was asked about what should be done with regard to a young man shot in the back seven times, in front of his children, I didn’t hear much of anything come from him. What should we be doing about it? He went down the line. I wish he’d take responsibility. As much as he’d like to be running against somebody else, he’s running against me, Joe Biden. The fact is, that he is not acting very responsible. (22:33)
I’m sorry. Am I, over here? Okay. (22:51)
That’s right. (23:00)
Help is on the way. I’ve laid out a clear plan for childcare, a clear plan for starting early education as well, so three and four and five year olds are in school. But I’m not President right now. What we should be doing, is we should be providing for more help for people who in fact, are trying to juggle the choice between, do I stay home with my three, four or five-year old and take care of them in the middle of this COVID problem? Or, do I go to work and earn a salary? What do I do? That’s why we have, I have a major initiative to deal with childcare and eldercare, so people can be adequately paid to come and take care of folks, children, as well as the elderly that you may be taking care of a parent, a husband and wife may be taking care of, as well as making sure that those folks are able to get back to work.(23:57)
That’s why focusing on daycare centers and making sure they’re safe and healthy now ,is equally as important as dealing with, almost as equally important as dealing with schools. We should be providing all of the PPE and all of the safety that is necessary in sanitary capacity, to allow them to open. Hundreds of them have been opening, because some states have gone in and done that. There should be universal guidance coming from the President of United States of America. There should be basic standards to how, in fact, and what circumstances you can safely open a daycare center, you can safely open a childcare center.(24:35)
In addition to that, in the future, the idea, this has brought home a number of glaring problems we have in America, this whole pandemic, and what’s happened in terms of jobs. The idea that we’re in a situation where you have so many parents who have to make the difficult choice as a single parent or both working parents, to decide whether one gives up their salary and stays home with a child under the age of five or six, and/or somehow leaves them with somebody that there’s not particularly qualified and goes to work so they can earn a living, is a choice that is not, we shouldn’t be making.(25:12)
We’re the only industrialized country in the world that forces people to make that kind of choice. There should be, no one should have to pay more than 7% of their income to provide for childcare and be able to go to work. This is something that is a major element of my Build Back Better program. But in the meantime, in the meantime, the most important thing that can be done is have CDC issue really straightforward guidelines, on what circumstances you should be able to open up your daycare center or your childcare center now. There should be clear standards and states should have the wherewithal to be able to go out and inspect those facilities, now.(25:56)
But, one I haven’t mentioned, and I think it warrants mentioning. One of the things we did, remember when we inherited the great recession and we were going into the tank, heading off the cliff or heading into a depression, I was able to convince three Republicans had changed their vote. We ended up with the so-called Recovery Act, which spent over $800 billion in 18 months, kept us from going into depression. But what did we do? We spent almost, we spent billions of dollars, making sure that states were able to maintain their essential workers. Everyone from their fire departments, their school teachers, their doctors, their nurses, their public hospitals.(26:41)
Now what’s happening? This Republican administration will not support that and the Republican leadership in the United States Senate will not support it. So, what’s happening? We don’t have that help. It’s not out there. States are in real trouble and to quote my good friend, Mitch McConnell, he says, “Let the states go, bankrupt.”States have to balance their budgets, under the law. Communities, counties, cities, they have to balance their budget. There’s a reason why the federal government is able to run a deficit, to compensate in times of real economic crisis and what’s happening, nothing, nothing. Guess what? We came out of that recession with the longest spurt of economic growth in any administration in American history. But these guys don’t, I don’t [inaudible 00:27:33] and I could go on. Businesses, look at the money that was passed under the CARES Act, for businesses, small businesses be able to stay open. You have tens of thousands of going out of business, many of them permanently. Why? Because, the money didn’t get to small businesses. They’re not open. We should be dealing with those businesses that have been burned out and those and damaged. We should be finding federal help for those businesses to get back on their feet.(28:01)
But this administration seems to think it’s all of a sudden going to go away, like angel dust is going to be sprayed around. Everything’s going to be okay. I just don’t get it. They have to know better. They have to know better. We had an example, just the last administration, how much good you can do and how much growth you can generate. I just don’t get these guys. I really, don’t. Not a joke. I’ve been doing this a long time, but I’ve never seen a president lack as much leadership, unwilling, an inability to make a deal. You got about, I’m told the reason why they can’t get anything done in the Republican Congress, is 20 members of the United States Senate saying under no circumstances, will they raise the deficit at all.(28:47)
Well, that’s wonderful. We’re in a position we’re in now. Look at other countries. They’re doing one hell of a lot better. Yet, we still have over, what’s it up to, 186,000 people dead. Over 6 million, was it, 6, ,000, whatever the number is, that have contracted the disease and no end in sight. It’s just irresponsible. Talk about a no-nothing Congress. On the Republican side. No, not even the president. I mean, I don’t get it. I really don’t get it, but it’s going to change, come January, God willing. (29:35)
Well, I say that I understand their concern, because so many of the teachers also have other preexisting conditions that lend itself to the fact that if they were to contract the COVID disease, COVID-19, that they would be very susceptible to be in real trouble. It’s understandable why they’re doing it. But the first thing to do, is make sure that all the protective capacity that we have available to us is made available. And then-(30:03)
Capacity that we have available to us, is made available and then let the districts make choice about whether or not they open fully, whether they rotate and whether or not those teachers are able to be able to teach from home and remote learning. But it’s really understandable why they would, look what’s happened in this coed crisis so far. A hundred million, I mean 100,000 people have died who were above the age of 65. 100,000 out of the 200 and some that have died or not 200 and some, it’s 189 or whatever it is now. It estimated, I heard today, the estimates range from two significant universities. One, there’s going to be as many as 239, I think. And another one said by December, 312. I don’t know that, but it’s going to go higher. And so, I don’t understand why it’s a political problem? What is the politics about not being willing to go in and help provide the protective capacity for people to be able to go back to work and don’t go to school? I can’t fathom it. (32:06)
Well, look, I know you’re tired of hearing me say this. I’ve been saying it since last January. The idea that you’re going to be able to get the economy back on track without getting COVID under control is completely counterintuitive. It’s not there. It can’t happen. Unless we’re able to deal with the disease and drastically cut its impact on people’s confidence of being able to either go to work or walk into a business or do business, then it doesn’t matter a lot. There is going to be no need in my view, to be able to shut down the whole economy. I got asked by David Murer, a question. If I was asked to shut everything down, I took that as a generic question. Am I going to follow the science?(32:57)
I am going to insist and I insist now, without any authority, that every responsible person in this country, when they’re out in public or not with a cohort that they have lived with, because they know they haven’t spread it to their husband, wife, et cetera, that they wear a mask. That they wear a mask and keeps socially distanced. You can take a mask off when you’re 12, 15 feet away, but I would really, really make the case. And by the way, when I find these folks talking about my freedom, I talk about patriotism. Why do you wear a mask? To protect your neighbor, to keep someone else from getting sick and maybe dying. I call that patriotic. This is the United States of America. Every generation has made sacrifices to help others in moments of crisis. (34:07)
No, no. (34:10)
What I suggested was I would ask every person in authority. There’s a question whether or not a president, under the constitution, could mandate everyone wearing masks. And remember all during the primary, I’d have a lot of people telling me I would by executive order, do. I’m a constitutionalist. You can’t do things the Constitution doesn’t allow you the power to do. What I be doing is putting as much pressure as I could on every governor, every Senator, excuse me every mayor, every county executive, every local official, and everyone in business, putting pressure on them to say what you’re doing is irresponsible. Make sure you wear a mask and maintain social distancing. And the vast majority of the American people accept that notion. (35:09)
You want to go dinner? No. I tell you what, look, what I’m having to spend a lot of it on is to counter the lies that are being told by Trump’s campaign and swift voters out there, a new pack. But what I’m trying to do is spend most of that … And by the way, I think the average contribution was like 40 bucks. We have over a 1,600,000 people who contributed in the middle of this economic crisis, somewhere between five, 10, $15. I’d say that shows some genuine enthusiasm about wanting to make sure that we have a chance of becoming President of United States.(35:56)
And so, what I will spend most of it doing is trying to explain to the American people how I want to unite the country, what I want to do to make the country better, why I’m so confident we can do it, why I’m so confident that we can bring the country together and be in a better position than before this crisis occurred. Because there’s been so many fissures exposed as a consequence of what’s happened, that people are now realizing my Lord, I didn’t know that people in that circumstance didn’t have that kind of help. I didn’t know, whatever. And so I think we have an enormous opportunity to bring the country together. And once again, lead the world. You’ve heard me say it a hundred times, not just by the example of our power, but the power of our example. Thank you all so very much for taking the time. Thank you."

Good afternoon folks. Sorry I’m a little late. I was a mesmerized. I was walking out of the office, that listening to an interview of former General Barry McCaffrey and Bill Cohen, former Secretary of Defense. Before I begin, I want to speak a little bit to what they talked about and the revelations about President Trump’s disregard for our military and our veterans. Quite frankly, if what is written in the Atlantic is true, it’s disgusting. At affirms what most of us believe to be true, that Donald Trump is not fit to do the job of President, to be the Commander in Chief. The President reportedly said, and I emphasize reportedly, said that those who sign up to serve, instead of doing something more lucrative are suckers. Let me be real clear. When my son was an Assistant US Attorney and he volunteered to go to Kosovo, when the war is going on as a civilian, he wasn’t a sucker.(12:46)
When my son volunteered and joined the United States military, as the Attorney General and went to Iraq for a year, won the Bronze Star and other commendations, he wasn’t a sucker. The service men and women he served with, particularly those who did not come home, were not losers. If these statements are true, the President should humbly apologize to every Gold Star Mother and Father and every Blue Star Family that he’s denigrated and insulted. Who the heck does he think he is? Is it true? Well, we’ve heard from his own mouth, his characterizations of an American hero, John McCain as a loser in 2015. Donald Trump said he was not a war hero. I like people who weren’t captured. Well good for him. And his dismissal of the traumatic brain injury suffered by troops serving in Iraq, as mere headaches, not too long ago. He stood by failing-(14:02)
He stood by failing, failing to take action or even raise the issue with Vladimir Putin while the Kremlin puts bounties on the heads of American troops in Afghanistan. It’s a sacred duty and you’re tired of hearing me say this. Those of you who’ve been covering me for years know. I get in trouble for saying it, but I’m going to say it again. We have many obligations as a government. We only have one truly sacred obligation. Equipped and support those who we send into harm’s way, care for their families while they’re gone, and care for them when they are home. That’s the only truly sacred obligation the government has. Duty, honor, country. These are values that drive our service members. It’s an all voluntary outfit. President Trump is demonstrated he has no sense of service, no loyalty to any cause other than himself. If I have the honor of being the next commander in chief, I will ensure that our American heroes know I’ll have their backs, honor their sacrifice. And those who’ve been injured will be in military parades. I’m always cautioned not to lose my temper. This may be as close as I come in this campaign. Just a marker of how deeply President Trump and I disagree about the role of the president of the United States of America. The August jobs report came out this morning. And I’m grateful for everyone who found work again and found a glimmer of hope that brings them back from the edge, but there is real cause for concern as well. The pace of the job gains in August was slower than July, significantly slower than in May and June. More and more temporary layoffs are turning into permanent layoffs. 28 million people filed for unemployment. And after six months in the pandemic, we’re less than halfway back to where we were with 11 million, 11.5 million Americans not getting their jobs back. We’re still down 720, 000 manufacturing jobs. In fact, Donald Trump may be the only president of modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he took office.(17:14)
I’ve talked to a lot of real working people, ask them. They feel like they’re being left behind. Ask them, how do they feel about the economy coming back? You’ll find they don’t feel it. And that’s why I’m here today, to thank Paul Calistro and his team for hosting us at West End Neighborhood House here in Wilmington. Paul, your continued tradition of doing God’s work through this community is important. It’s been around for more than 130 years. Through pandemics, wars, depressions. West End has been here for generations of people who are just looking for a chance, not a handout. Just a fair shot at a good job, a safe place to live, and a better life to pass down to their kids.(18:05)
This is a special place for the Biden family. My daughter, Ashley, a social worker, was a caseworker here helping young people who are aging out of foster care. When my son was the Attorney General, Beau came here, right here, to learn more about job training programs for those working toward a GED and a certificate for a good paying job. When I was senator and vice president, there were plenty of economists I had around me to talk about every aspect of the economy. But I always think about the people who walked through the doors here. Working people, white, Black, brown, Latino. What are they doing? Are they okay? I knew if they’re okay, they walk through these doors, the economy was doing okay. If they weren’t okay, we weren’t doing well.(18:58)
That’s what we should be thinking about is this latest jobs report. But the report reinforces the worst fears and painful truths. The economic inequities that began before the downturn have only worsened under this failed presidency. When the crisis started, we all hope for a few months of a shutdown would be followed by a rapid economic turnaround. No one thought they’d lose their job for good or see small businesses shut down en masse. But that kind of recovery requires leadership, leadership we didn’t have and still don’t have. And as a result, economists are starting to call this recession a K-shaped recession, which is a fancy phrase for what’s wrong with everything about Trump’s presidency. The K means those at the top are seeing things go up. And those in the middle and below are seeing things go down and get worse. It’s no surprise because at root of this is the fact that Trump has mismanaged the COVID crisis. And that’s why it’s a K-shaped pandemic.(20:10)
First, the president’s chaotic mismanagement of the pandemic is still holding us back. Compared to other major industrial countries in Europe and Asia, during the pandemic, our unemployment rate is still more than double, while other nations have only gone up by half. Why? Because the president has botched the COVID response, botched it badly. I’ve said from the beginning we can’t deal with an economic crisis until you beat the pandemic. You can’t have an economic comeback when almost 1000 Americans die each day from COVID, when the death toll was reached about 200,000, when more than six million Americans have been infected, when million more worry about getting sick and dying, and schools and businesses try to reopen.(21:04)
We all know it didn’t have to be this bad. It didn’t have to be this bad to begin with if the president just did his job, if he just took the virus seriously early on in January and February as it spread around the globe, if he just took the steps we needed back in March and April, institute widespread testing and tracing to control the virus, if he provided clear national scientific-based guidance to state and local authorities, if he just set a good example like social distancing and wearing a mask. It’s not too much to ask. It’s almost like he doesn’t care. It doesn’t affect him because it doesn’t affect him or his class of friends.(21:48)
Anyone with a big enough checkbook can get rapid tests on demand. If you don’t, you might have to wait in line for hours and wait for weeks to get your result, if you can get them at all. You have the kind of job where you can work from a laptop at home remotely, risking getting COVID is very small at work. This job report shows that 37 million people reported teleworking in August. But if you work in an assembly line or check out counter or a meat packing plant or drive a truck or deliver packages, you’re at much greater risk. And the job report shows that more than 27 million workers reported that they couldn’t work or lost hours because their employer had to close or lost business due to the pandemic.(22:41)
If you can hire a private tutor or have a live-in childcare, you can balance being a parent and remote schooling. If you can’t, you have to do your job and be a teacher all at once. Jill and I have held briefings on reopening school safety two days ago, asking the question as we hear so many parents call and ask us, educators as well who feel like they’re in an impossible situation. What are they supposed to do with our children when the president has made it so hard for schools to reopen safely? What’s the alternative when it’s devastating to keep them isolated from their friends and their support systems? I also said earlier this week, to the shock of many, we have lost more cops this year to COVID than on patrol. Just a reminder how an already dangerous job, law enforcement, has gotten more dangerous because of Trump’s mismanagement.(23:49)
What may be just as shocking is many other jobs have also become dangerous due to COVID. Being a healthcare worker is now more dangerous than ever. We’ve lost hundreds of them this year because they weren’t protected from COVID on the job. Being a meat packer is more dangerous than ever. So many have died due to getting COVID at work. Work for waitresses and waiters and transit workers all have become more dangerous, with so many dying of COVID. Ladies and gentlemen, no matter what he says or what he claims, you are not safer in Donald Trump’s America. You’re not safe in Donald Trump’s America where people are dying at a rate last seen when Americans were fighting in World War II. Donald Trump’s malpractice during this pandemic has made being a working American a life or death work. And while there is a disproportionate impact on Black, Latino, and Asian Americans and Native Americans working class communities, white working class communities are being hit hard as well.(24:59)
Opioid deaths, for example, are up during the pandemic. Another crisis that Trump continues to all but ignore. In the meantime, Trump and his friends have strong views about what the rest of America should do. Quote, “Cut unemployment benefits to force people to go back to their jobs,” end of quote. “Defund social security and eliminate Obamacare in the middle of a pandemic,” end of quote. Reopen public schools without resources or guidance. Reopen main street business without protection for workers so corporations can continue to soar. This is their plan?(25:43)
Second and similarly, the economic pain remains unrelenting for millions of working people of every race and background aren’t getting relief they need. Meanwhile, wealthy are doing just fine, some better than ever. This divergence in fortunes is unique to any recession in recent memory. And the painful truth is we just have a president who just doesn’t see it. He doesn’t feel it. He doesn’t understand. He just doesn’t care. He thinks if the stock market is up, then everything’s fine. If his wealthy friends and donors are doing well, then everything’s doing well. If corporations see their valuations rising, then they must be hiring. But the best economists know what I know. I have learned growing up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware up the road, places where folks aren’t invested in the market like wealthy Americans. A measure of our economic success is the quality of life of the American people.(26:54)
And if your stocks soar as families teeter on the brink of hunger and homelessness and our president calls that success, what does that say about what he values? When you see the world in such a narrow prism, it’s no wonder he doesn’t see nearly 30 million Americans on unemployment, one in six small businesses that closed right now. He doesn’t understand what life is like for people walking by their boarded up shops, educators afraid that doing their job, that job they love, will bring the virus home to the people they love, or of parents searching for health insurance now that the furlough has turned into a layoff. It’s no wonder he doesn’t see the single mom forced to wait in the three hour food line so for the first time in her life, so she can feed her family because she’s now part of the one in six households with children that don’t have enough to eat. He wants us to believe that we’re doing better, to keep it up and not-(28:03)
… that we’re doing better, to keep it up and not notice that this remains the worst economic situation since the Great Depression and our country face the historic divergence in our way of life. Which gets me to my third and final point and what the American people really need to understand, all the pain and suffering stems from President Trump’s failure to lead, his sheer inability and willingness to bring people together, he likes to sign executive orders, actions for photo ops, but they’re ill-conceived and could do more harm than good. He says, “Protecting renters from eviction,” that’s what he’s doing, but he’s not giving them any support to pay the rent when it comes due. Millions of Americans, all will be left with a terrible choice between eviction and living in the streets or paying back rent they simply don’t have when there was an answer offered and rejected. He says he’s continuing to provide enhanced unemployment insurance payments, but he cut the amount that everyone on it receive, leaves them on the edge when it runs out in a few weeks or sooner.(29:21)
He should be doing his job of calling congressional leaders together immediately to get a deal and deliver real results for the American people. This is the first president in the middle of a crisis I’ve never seen has called Congress into the Oval Office. If I were president, that’s what I’d do and I’d get it done like previous presidents. Rentals, food, unemployment assistance, tens of millions struggling Americans, student loan reliefs, small business support, and aid to schools and state governments that are going bankrupt. And as long as this pandemic and the economic catastrophe persist, no one should have their water or power cut off because they can’t afford to pay the bill. Bottom line, Mr. President, do your job, get off your golf course and out of the sand bunker, call the leaders together in the Oval Office, sit with them and make a deal. Make a deal that delivers for working Americans and eases their anxiety and pain. In July, I laid out my Build Back Better plan for an economy that works for everyone. Over the next three weeks I’ll be laying out the sharp contrast my plan has with the president’s non-plans. I’ll be asking American people three basic questions, who can handle a pandemic? Who can keep their promises? And who cares about and will fight for working families? Like the people here at West End, throughout this pandemic, they found their way to keep the center open safely and provide for critical services. No one here has been laid off. They adjusted their spaces for social distancing. They started a lending program to help local businesses, hair salons, and other small businesses. They continue their childcare services, which is critical for so many working families.(31:25)
By pure courage, heart, and grit, they never give up and they never give in and they pursue the full promise for America. That’s the story of the people of this community and this country, that’s who we are. Give ordinary American just half a chance and they never let the country down, they’ll do extraordinary things, they’ll never let us down unlike the current president. And unlike the current president I won’t let you down either, that’s what this election is about, helping people unite, get together, move this country back in the direction that we can be, there’s nothing beyond our capacity, nothing, if we just do it together. Thank you all, and I now take your questions. I guess… Are you calling on people or how am I… I don’t have a list, so you go ahead and call. (32:59)
I’m going to try to be measured in my response. If it’s true, and based on other things he said I believe the article is true, I’d ask you all the rhetorical question, how do you feel? How would you feel if you had a kid in Afghanistan right now? How would you feel if you lost a son, daughter, husband, wife? How would you feel, for real? I know that’s not your job to express that feeling, but you know in your heart, you know in your gut, it’s deplorable. As I’ve said many times, I’ll say again, these folks are the backbone of America, they’re the heart, the soul, the grit, that’s what patriotism is about. I’ve probably… I’ve just never been as disappointed in my whole career with a leader that I’ve worked with president or otherwise, that if the article is true and it appears to be based on other things he’s said, it is absolutely damnable, it is a disgrace.:37)
Let’s get on a somewhat related topic. What would you say to the supporters of the QAnon, the people who believe in that conspiracy, what they think is true about America, that there’s sex trafficking and a conspiracy against President Trump? And what would you say to President Trump for not rejecting that conspiracy and the people who believe in it?(35:06)
I’ve been a big supporter of mental health, I’d recommend that people who believe it maybe should take advantage while it still exists in the Affordable Care Act. It’s bizarre, totally bizarre. And now, have you guys found that planeload of people in uniforms, and weapons, and flying around? I mean, have you found them yet? Is there anybody even from… By the way, I respect conservatism and liberal points of view in the press. Anybody found that plane? What in God’s name are we doing? Look at how it makes us look around the world, it’s mortified, it’s embarrassing, and it’s dangerous. If the president doesn’t know better, which I… He has to know better, and my Lord we’re in much more trouble than I ever thought we were. It’s bizarre.(36:09)
And this is a case where I’ve been surprised, pleased, but surprised with folks I’ve had political arguments with like the former governor of Michigan coming out and endorse me, all the Republicans are endorsing me, they’ll reach where, that this can’t go on, I mean, this cannot go on. It’s a deconstruction of a democratic system, they know it. So, I just… I’ll conclude with what you heard me say times before, the words of a president matter, even a lousy president, it gives succor, it gives encouragement to people who are spouting irrational views that no one has even close to ever presuming or showing ever existed. And it’s done for a simple reason, from the very beginning he’s understood the only way he could win the first time and can win this time is he fundamentally divides the nation, puts the nation… Divides us so we’re at each other’s throats, that’s not who we are.:43)
Thank you, sir. (38:22)
Well, I wear [inaudible 00:38:24] is a big issue, I’m a smart fellow, I listen to scientists, this is not a game, life and death. Reports that we’re going to have maybe… There’s some reports that say another 100,000 dead, as many as a 100,000 dead, more by the end of the year. I mean, I don’t get it. I mean, I just… Anyway, it’s hard to respond to something so idiotic. (39:07)
Yes, I have. (39:09)
I’ve been tested once with a deep test, and I’m going to continue to be testing on a regular basis. (39:37)
No, it’s not consistent with the briefings I’ve received. And he’s a lousy enough attorney general, but he’s a really bad intelligence officer. (39:51)
Because I believe what I’ve been told, and you all know it. I mean, look, it’s… You even have office like Facebook taking somewhat… Look, it’s just… There are a lot of countries around the world, I think, would be happy to see our elections destabilized, but the one who’s working the hardest, most consistently, and never has led up is Russia. And again, it’s unfair to say to you guys, but ask yourself the rhetorical question, what is he so afraid of Vladimir Putin [inaudible 00:12:30]? I mean, what’s the problem? I mean, nothing, it’s almost obsequious. I mean… Anyway, I just want to make it clear, I believe any country that engages in any activity to delegitimize or impact on American elections is a direct violation of our sovereignty, and if I am President of United States, there will be a response. (41:32)
She’s been on the road, she’s out herself. The role is that, just like when Barack and I campaigned, we try to cover as much territory as we could, and both of us out campaigning. She is an incredibly competent candidate, she is doing a great job. There will be times where together, but there’s a lot of territory to cover. I talk with her almost every day, I speak with her, we work together, and I have great confidence in her. There’s nothing about not campaigning together, it’s about being able to cover more territory.(42:03)
… About not campaigning together. It’s about being able to cover more territory. (42:12)
Well, what they’re doing is they’re going to do it on a regular basis because everyone on my service detail and people who come into the house with me, they’re all tested. I just, “Yes, sir.” Show up and put my head back, when they tell me. (42:31)
Pardon me? (42:34)
I imagine it will be sometime this week. I just don’t know, but it will be a regular basis. (43:11)
It is a felony. It would be felony here in the state of Delaware. Look, I mean, how many times does this president have to suggest things and say things where you all, don’t just write, he’s a fraud. Not an opinion. Maybe we should delay the election. Maybe we should write in ballots are fraudulent, not a single bit of evidence. And I think it’s all designed to create so much chaos that no matter what the outcome of the election is that is thrown up in the air. That must be his reason because he says, and does things that no other president that I’m aware of in American history has ever done. And we all go, “Well, here’s another ridiculous, illegal, inappropriate thing he said, but he says so many of them, it doesn’t matter.” It just undermines the legitimacy of our democratic process and it’s dangerous. (44:53)
Because presidents United States should be presidential and should lead by example, as well as make clear exactly where they stand. Getting down in the gutter like the president does saying things that I’d be inclined, if we were behind a barn somewhere, it’d be a different thing. But that’s not the job of a president. The job of a president sets an example. My anger is real because I must tell you, I carry and I deliberately didn’t bring it with me today. The Delaware National Guard had a pin made up. That’s a gold star that was made up for my son, Beau, who didn’t die in the field. And I always carry it with me and I didn’t carry it today because I was worried that if I focus too much on it, that I would engage in some of the kind of language the president’s used. I mean, but I just think it is sick. It is deplorable. It is so un-American. It is so unpatriotic.(46:18)
And then watching him this morning while I was shaving and the TV on talking about he never said anything like that. He honored John McCain. He’s the reason why flags are flown at half mast. Oh, wasn’t that noble of him. He’s the same guy that when the ship went into harbor and made sure the USS McCain was covered, you couldn’t see it. He’s the same guy that denigrated John. He’s the same guy who did a similar thing where he talked about George H.W. Bush, he was shot down in the Pacific. I mean, but he just stands there. It’s almost pathological. I’ve never said anything like that. No ones been better than the military. I just got to focus on what has to be done, not what he did, what I do from here. What gets done from here. (47:47)
Yes, I am. That’s why I try not to talk about it too much because I’m playing into. The more we talk about it … There’s two things he wants us to talk about, is the election legitimate? And the whole country is up in flames. Everything’s burning, law and order because he doesn’t want to talk about anything, anything at all about the job he hasn’t done. And so it’s a conundrum. There’s a lot we could talk about in terms of the specifics that Russia is doing and not doing it. But when you do, all it does is undermine what people think may be legitimate. What I don’t want to have happen, I don’t want people reaching the point where you can understand sometimes. It’s not worth voting.(48:40)
It seems to me that one of the things that I keep trying to say to people is, “Go to, Iwillvote.com.” Iwillvote.com and figure out where you can vote, how you can vote. What’s available to you, where you could vote early, where you could vote in person, where it’s going to be safe for you, et cetera. Plan now, plan now. But the more chaos that is sewn here, it’s going to disincline people to show up. And in a sense, every time I speak about it, I feel like I’m playing into his game. Not do you agree with me, but does that make sense what I’m saying? So I think that’s all part of the deal. (49:58)
I think any job added back is positive. I think it matters to the people who got that job back. Maybe you all were raised in households like I was where my mom or dad was losing a job because of the economy, what’s going on in your community. You could feel the tension unease in the household, how it just, everything. Worrying about whether you can provide for your family. And then along the way, also look at the people who you’ve got … A couple million people out there close to, who are part time workers who still can’t make it, but are listed as employed. And a lot of them also are in the process of wondering whether or not. I mean, they’re a lot of people lined up in food lines. There are the people, many of them who have lost their healthcare, their health care provided by their employer.(51:03)
They’re the same people out there worrying, if this president is able to win in court and wipe out the entire Affordable Care Act and all the 100 million people with preexisting conditions, won’t be able to get insurance, even if they had the money. It’s just, the anxiety is enormous, is enormous. And look, again, I’m not being solicitous. Among the brightest people I’ve dealt with my whole career, have been the press, not a joke. You’re all extremely well educated. You’re well-read, you have significant backgrounds and the vast majority have tried to report the news, not just opinion, but I can’t believe that you don’t feel the same … Not Democrat, Republican. Okay.(52:04)
You don’t feel the same anxiety because you got a brother, a sister, a mother, a father, son, or a daughter who’s going through what you’re not, what we’re not. We have jobs. I don’t have a job now, but we have jobs. And so it’s a real concern. And I just think that this has moved beyond Democrat, Republican. I think it’s moved to trying to put this country back together again. So we can move. (52:51)
I like to engage. (53:30)
Well, first of all, I don’t know what the deal is you’re referring to. Okay. What I have argued relative to Serbia and Kosovo, is that Kosovo should be an independent country, not a part of Serbia. I’ve spent a lot of time there. And so I don’t know how … I assume that would reinforce that independence, but I don’t know, based on what’s being said. I think normalization of relations among countries is a by and large an almost every instance, a good thing to have a Muslim majority country normalizing relations with Israel. And in a generic sense seems positive to me, but I have to know the detail of what’s happening, what’s going on. And I don’t know that and it may, you may be right, that, that would cause the Palestinians to lose leverage in a decision on a two state solution. I’d have to look [crosstalk 00:54:36]. (54:39)
Oh, I do. Absolutely, I do. I do. And I think that’s the thing, recognizing Israel as an independent Jewish state. I think that’s important. But also, I believe that Israel has to be prepared to work toward a genuine two state solution. Thank you all very much. (55:29)
[inaudible 00:55:29]. (55:29)
Sure. The answer is yes. It’s still a great nation."

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Vice President Harris and I, as she indicated, just met with a group of America’s top business leaders and labor leaders. And I must tell you, it reinforced what I thought from the beginning – we’re ready to come together. The unity was astounding. I want to go back and talk about the people who actually participated in that. I’m going to list all the people, just so you know who we spoke with. Number one, there was Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, Brian Cornell, CEO of Target, Mr. Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, Rory Gamble, president of the UAW, Mary Kay Henry, president SCIU, Mark Perrone, president of the UFCW, Lee Saunders, president of AFSCME and Sonia Syngal, president of Gap, Richard Trumka president of the AFL-CIO.(05:23)
It was really encouraging, quite frankly, to get people, business and labor, together agreeing on the way forward, which I’m convinced the American people will rally to do when they hear what we have in mind. And I’m very pleased it all came together around the same table to advance areas of common ground. And we agreed we’re going to continue these conversations. They represent very different perspectives, but I’m convinced that we can all come together around the same table to advance areas of common ground, which are really, I wish you could have all heard the conversation. It was really encouraging, and that’s what we were ready to discuss today.(06:05)
We all agreed that we want to get the economy back on track. We need our workers to be back on the job by getting the virus under control. We’re going in a very dark winter. Things are going to get much tougher before they get easier. And that requires sparing no effort to fight COVID so that we can open our businesses safely, resume our lives and put this pandemic behind us. It’s going to be difficult, but it can be done.(06:29)
And they all agreed that means rallying the country behind a national strategy with robust public health measures like mandatory masking, widely available testing with rapid results, scaled up production of life-saving treatments and therapeutics, and safe, equitable, and free distribution of the vaccine. It’s great news that Moderna and Pfizer have each come up with vaccines that are in excess of 90% effectiveness. And getting the vaccine and a vaccination, though, are two different things. Everyone on our call today, in our Zoom today, agreed that the sooner we have access to the administration’s distribution plan, the sooner this transition would be smoothly, move forward.(07:14)
And you know, as we battle COVID what have to make sure that business and workers have the tools, the resources, the national guidance and health and safety standards to operate safely. And we can do that. We can bring Democrats and Republicans together, work with business and labor to deliver those necessary resources. And for millions of Americans who’ve lost hours and wages, or have lost their jobs, we all agreed on our call that we can deliver immediate relief and it need be done quickly. Affordable healthcare for millions of people who have lost it, or are in danger of losing it. Childcare, sick leave, family leave, so workers don’t have to choose between work and family. Corporate America agreed on this today, the folks on the call.(08:02)
We need to support small businesses and entrepreneurs that are the backbone of our communities but are teetering on the edge. And we all agreed on the urgent need for funding for States and localities to keep frontline workers and essential workers on the job, vital public services, running law enforcement offices, educators, first responders, like we did with The Recovery Act of 2009, saving literally millions of jobs.(08:31)
There’s a reason why the federal government is able to run a deficit. Because the States must, must balance their budgets. And they’re in real trouble. You’re going to see hundreds of thousands of police officers, firefighters, first responders, mental health clinics, you’re going to see them going out of business. Right now, Congress should come together and pass a COVID relief package like The Heroes Act that the House passed six months ago. Once we shut down the virus and deliver economic-(09:03)
… months ago. Once we shut down the virus and deliver economic relief to workers and businesses, then we can start to build back better than before. We talked about how we have an opportunity to come out of this stronger, more resilient than we were when we went in, and I wish you could have heard corporate leaders and the major labor leaders singing from the same hymnal here. Throughout the campaign, I laid out my Build Back Better plan. We laid out a plan that an independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a well-respected Wall Street firm, projected would create 18.6 million jobs. We talked about the need to own the electric vehicle market. We talked about climate a lot, building 550,000 charging stations, creating over a million good-paying union jobs here at home. The need for a federal government to invest more in clean energy research.(10:03)
It’s based on a simple premise, it’s time to reward work, not just wealth in America. We’re going to have a fair tax structure that makes sure the wealthiest among us and corporations pay their fair share. Our plan will create millions of good-paying union jobs in manufacturing, building the vehicles, products, technologies that we’re going to need for the future to compete with the rest of the world. From autos to our stockpiles, we’re going to buy American. No government contract will be given to companies that don’t make their products here in America. To secure our position as a global leader in research and development, we’re going to invest $300 billion in the most critical, competitive new industries in technologies creating 3 million good-paying jobs. And the corporate American technology firms like Microsoft on the call, they all agreed. We can make sure a future is made here in America. And that’s good for business and it’s good for American workers.(11:08)
We can also modernize infrastructure, roads, bridges, ports. 1.5 million new affordable housing units. High-speed broadband, we talked about, for every American household, which is more important than ever for remote learning, remote working, telemedicine in 21st century. Building a digital infrastructure to help businesses, healthcare workers, first responders and students. A hundred billion dollars to rebuild our crumbling schools. They talked about the need, the business community, talked about the need to invest in HBCUs and community colleges. Retrofitting 4 million new buildings, our old buildings, retrofitting them and making them new. Weatherizing 2 million homes. Building more climate resilient cities and towns. These investments will specifically target communities of colors so we can break the cycle where in good times they lag, and in a bad times, they get hit first and the hardest and in a recovery, it’s the toughest to bounce back. These are the kinds of investments that are going to strengthen our economy and our competitiveness, create millions of jobs, union jobs, and in doing so, respect the dignity of work and empower the voice of workers.(12:26)
You’ve heard me say it before. My dad, when he lost his job in Scranton, eventually moved to Wilmington and got a good job. He’d say, Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity, respect, your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, honey, everything’s going to be okay. When we build back better, we’ll do so with higher wages, including a $15 minimum wage nationwide, better benefits, stronger collective bargaining rights that you could raise a family on. That’s how we build back the middle-class better than ever. That’s how we make sure workers are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. I can go on. I can tell I was very encouraged by our conversation, but the point is this: there’s so much we can do. The only way we do any of this is if we work together. I know we can do this.(13:24)
For example, on the call, I made it clear to the corporate leaders. I said, I want you to know I’m a union guy. Unions are going to have increased power. It is not, they understand. It’s not anti-business. It’s about economic growth, creating good-paying jobs. 11 years ago when Barack and I took office during the great recession and implemented the recovery act that saved us from another Great Depression. We didn’t see a map in red and blue states – it was the United States of America. We didn’t care whether the city had voted for us or against us, the state voted for us or against us. We work with everyone and we recovered and rebuilt together as one nation. We can do this again. Refusal of Democrats and republics to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control. It’s a conscious decision. It’s a choice that we make.(14:24)
If we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. I believe this is in part, a mandate for American people. Part of the mandate they gave us. They want us to cooperate. They want us to deliver results. And the choice that Kamala and I will make is that we’re going to do that. That’s why I’m so pleased today we were able to bring together business and labor leaders to make the choice jointly with us. We’re all Americans. Let’s get to work. As I’ve said, many times. Thank you. May God bless you. And may God protect our troops. I understand now I’m going to take some questions, Megan, fire away. (15:13)
I’m looking in the wrong direction, sorry. (15:35)
More people may die, if we don’t coordinate. Look, as my chief of staff, Ron Klain would say, who handled Ebola, the vaccine is important. It’s of little use until you’re vaccinated. So how do we get the vaccine? How do we get over 300 million Americans vaccinated? What’s the game plan? It’s a huge, huge, huge undertaking to get it done, prioritize those with greatest need and working our way through it, and also cooperate with the World Health Organization and the rest of the world in dealing with this. And so they say they have this Warp Speed program that the not only dealt with getting vaccines, but also how to distribute this. If we have to wait until January 20th to start that planning, it puts us behind over a month, month and a half. And so it’s important that it be done, that there be coordination now. Now as rapidly as we can get that done. (16:54)
It does figure in my plan. I’ve laid out in detail. For example, the legislation passed by the democratic house calls for immediate $10,000 forgiveness of student loans. It’s holding people up. They’re in real trouble. They’re having to make choices between paying their student loan and paying the rent, those kinds of decisions. It should be done immediately. In addition to that, as you know, I think that everything from community college straight through to doubling Pell grants, to making sure that we have access to free education for anyone making under $125,000 for four years of college. And there is a program that exists now under the law that forgives student loans for being able to engage in public service. I’m going to institute that fundamental change in that so it’s able to be available to everyone, that in fact, is engaged. It’s not being very well managed right now. So I’m going to do all of those things. Thank you. (18:14)
Deal with every individual organization in the country, from business, to labor, Republicans and Democrats, to try to pull together a serious and consistent plan so we’re ready on day one. Everything from staffing to ultimately naming the cabinet members, to moving along on coordinating with business and labor, the COVID attack, how we’re going to attack COVID. And, so it would make it a lot easier if the President were to participate. You have a number of Republicans suggesting that. The good news here is my colleague is still on the Intelligence Committee, so she gets the intelligence briefings. I don’t anymore. So that is, but there’s a number of Republicans calling for that. I am hopeful that the President will be mildly more enlightened before we get to January 20th. (19:25)
My message is, I will work with you. I understand a lot of your reluctance because of the way the President operates, but I’ve been in contact with and will be in contact with more of them as we move along. And if it has to wait until January 20th to actually become operational, that’s a shame, but maybe that’s the only way to get it done. Thank you very much, Mary. (20:22)
I interpret that as Trumpianism. No change in his modus operandi, and I think the pressure will continue to build. Look, I’m having a lot of meetings with world leaders on the telephone. I can not get into negotiating with them about things that are going to be done, but they’re calling with some degree of enthusiasm. Everyone from our Holy Father to prime ministers across the globe. And so we’re along knowing what the outcome will be, and as I said earlier, and I probably shouldn’t repeat it, but I find this more embarrassing for the country than debilitating for my ability to get started. (21:35)
Well, first of all, we’ll see if that comes forward. And secondly, it’s important that people who are in the greatest need get it. I wouldn’t hesitate to get the vaccine, but I also want to set an example. But I wouldn’t hesitate to get the vaccine if in fact Dr. Fauci and these two organizations, whether it’s Moderna or Pfizer, who have been extremely responsible, conclude that it is safe and able to be done.(22:14)
Look, the only reason people question the vaccine now is because of Donald Trump. That’s the reason why people are questioning the vaccine, because all of the things he says and doesn’t say, whether, “Is it truthful? Is it not truthful?” The exaggerations. I think we’re on a clear path now. We’re on a clear path with the international community and national leaders in the scientific community have focused on these two vaccines. They appear to be ready for prime time, ready to be used, and if that continues on those roads. I would take the vaccine. (23:12)
Look, it depends on the state. What I failed to mention earlier is the enormous respect I have for Republican, conservative Republican governors who have stepped up and issued mandates for wearing masks. In North Dakota. One of the leaders in this area has been the Republican Governor in Ohio. And in addition to the folks who have already been leading, like the governor of Michigan, the idea that the President’s now existing remaining advisor on COVID is saying that they should resist.(23:59)
What the hell is the matter with these guys? What is the matter with them? Resist? You know, every major individual of any consequence in the health field is saying, “We can save 100,000 lives just between now and January 21 by wearing these masks.” It’s going to take a while for the vaccine to be able to be available, distributed, and get to people. We’re talking about 350,000 to 400,000 people dying. What are they doing? It’s totally irresponsible. Irresponsible. And so I compliment the governors who’ve stepped forward, who have been stepping forward, but also the Republican governors who stepped forward. I left out the Governor of Utah, very conservative state, Governor of North Dakota, and all the Democratic governors who have been doing it all along.(24:56)
I just ask a rhetorical question. Do you guys understand this? Does anybody understand why a governor would turn this into a political statement? It’s about patriotism. It’s about being patriotic. It’s about saving lives. For real. It’s not hyperbole. It’s about being patriotic. And I think you’re seeing more and more as this god awful virus continues to spread almost unabated that governors are stepping up. (25:55)
Well, here’s what I’d do. Let me tell you what the health experts have said to me. And it’s not because I’m unique and President-elect. It’s because of my family. They strongly urge that if in fact we’re going to have Thanksgiving with anyone, that we limit it to a maximum, maximum, they suggest five people, maximum 10 people, socially distanced, wearing masks. And people who have quarantined. So Jill and I spent this morning, like many of you, trying to figure out, “What are we going to do for Thanksgiving? How are we going to do it?” And we’ve narrowed down which family members, and that they were tested, recently tested, within 24 hours. And so I would strongly urge for the sake, not just your sake, for the sake of your children, your mother, your father, your sisters, your brothers, whoever you get together with at Thanksgiving, think about this. There should be no group more than 10 people in one room, I mean, inside the homes. That’s what they’re telling me. They’re telling me they’re making sure-(27:03)
That’s what they’re telling me. They’re telling me, they’re making sure that that’s the case. And I have the more potent mask behind this one, I took it off when I came out here, I wear it inside this, that to be masked saves lives.(27:17)
And so, look, I just want to make sure that we’re able to be together next Thanksgiving, next Christmas. It is an international crisis. It’s an international health crisis. And the idea, we’re at war with a virus. And it is, we’re at war, for real.(27:42)
And all kidding aside, I hope all of you, I’ve watched you all. You all seem to wear masks all the time when you’re… And the group that follows me, that is here… Follows me, that is assigned to Delaware with me, seem to do that. I strongly urge you to do it. There’s nothing much about not wearing a mask. (28:22)
I’ve watched Jill try to take it off. It’s hard. Thank God I don’t have an earring. (28:52)
What I would do, I would pass the Heroes Act. It has all the money and capacity to take care of each of those things, now. Now, not tomorrow. Now.(29:04)
And the idea the President is still playing golf and not doing anything about it, is beyond my comprehension. You’d at least think he’d want to go off on a positive note, but what is he doing? And there’s virtually no discussion. And the Republican were told, I don’t know that it’s true, you may know Senator, but there’s 22 Republicans say they won’t vote for anything.(29:29)
Well, there ought to be at least a dozen of them have the courage to stand up and save lives and jobs now. We should be doing it now. Keeping those businesses open, providing the PPE, the protective equipment, as well as the PPP, the money that we allow people to get funding to keep their businesses open, everything from separation, to testing, to a whole range of things that allow businesses to open and stay open. That’s what the plan was at the beginning. And by the way, if you notice in the very beginning, when they passed the stimulus program, the first two pieces, what happened? Businesses were staying open. And then when they weren’t open, they were still able to make people able to get paid.(30:15)
But look where they are now. People are running out of unemployment insurance. What are they going to do? 20 million people are on the verge of losing their home because they can’t make a mortgage payment. You have a larger number being kicked out, and will be kicked out, on the street because they can’t pay their rent.(30:35)
And by the way, it’s not just the renter, it’s the outfit that owns the building. A lot of them aren’t multimillionaires, they’re running small operations. How can they do it? This is about keeping Americans afloat. Get them through this pandemic, get them through where their business are able to come back. The money’s there. The money is there. (31:27)
I’ve talked with a number of these world leaders. And I told them under the law, I’m not able to begin to discuss with them. There’s only one President at a time, as to who can say what our policy will be.(31:41)
So I’m reluctant to answer that question now, but here’s what I can say, we make up 25% of the world’s trading capacity, of the economy of the world. We need to be aligned with the other democracies, another 25% or more, so that we can set the rules of the road, instead of having China and others dictate outcomes because they are the only game in town.(32:09)
But what I’m insisting on, and what I’ve been asked by world leaders, as to what I would do, without getting into detail, I’ve said, “But I want you to know that there are three things are going to happen if I’m elected. One, we’re going to invest in American workers and make them more competitive. Number two, we’re going to make sure that labor is at the table and environmentalists are at the table in any trade deals we make.” And I’m not looking for punitive trade. The idea that we are poking our finger in the eyes of our friends and embracing autocrats makes no sense to me.(32:46)
But I’m reluctant to get in more detail at this moment. I promise you I have a pretty thorough plan, and I hope you’re prepared to announce that to you on January 21st. (33:01)
Yes, that’s a generic notion of rejoining, but I didn’t get into the detail of what we will do in that agreement.(33:08)
The same thing with rejoining the World Health Organization. (33:12)
Because you’re asking me about whether I’d join a specific proposal, the details of which are now only being negotiated among those nations. In requiring negotiation. (33:23)
Thank you. Appreciate it."
biden_speech_vote.txt,"(03:04)
Good afternoon, everyone. Kamala and I we’re here to make a brief statement and I’m sure we’ll have more to say later and either tonight or tomorrow, but let me begin by thanking the press for being here and thank you to everyone else. My fellow Americans, yesterday, once again proved that democracy is the heartbeat of this nation. [inaudible 00:03:32] has been the heartbeat of this nation for two centuries. And even in the face of pandemic, more Americans voted this election than ever before in American history. Over 150 million people cast their votes. I think that’s just extraordinary. And if we had any doubts, we shouldn’t have any longer, about a government of, by, and for the people. It’s very much alive, very much alive in America. Here, the people rule. Power can’t be taken or asserted. It flows from the people. And is their will that determines who will be the President of the United States and their will alone.(04:22)
And now after a long night of counting, it’s clear that we’re winning enough states to reach 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. I’m not here to declare that we’ve won, but I am here to report when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners. Of all the votes counted, we have won Wisconsin by 20,000 votes, virtually the same margin that President Trump won that state four years ago. In Michigan, we lead by over 35,000 votes and it’s growing, a substantially bigger margin than President Trump won Michigan in 2016. Michigan will complete its vote soon, maybe as early as today. And I feel very good about Pennsylvania. Virtually all the remaining ballots to be counted are cast by mail. And we’ve been winning 78% of the votes by mail in Pennsylvania. We flipped Arizona and the second district of Nebraska. Of special significance to me is that we’ve won with the majority of the American people.(05:45)
And every indication is that that majority will grow. We have a popular vote lead of nearly 3 million votes and every indication is that will grow as well. Indeed, Senator Harris and I are on track to win more votes than any ticket in the history of this country that ever won the presidency and vice presidency. Over 70 million votes. I’m very proud of our campaign. Only three presidential campaigns in the past have defeated an incumbent president. When it’s finished, God willing, we’ll be the fourth. This is a major achievement. This is a major achievement. And it’s been a long and difficult campaign, but it’s been a more difficult time for our country, a hard time. We’ve had a hard campaigns before. We’ve faced hard times before. So once the selection is finalized and behind us, it’ll be time for us to do what we’ve always done as Americans, to put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us, to lower the temperature, to see each other again, to listen to one another, to hear each other again, and respect and care for one another, to unite, to heal, to come together as a nation.(07:18)
I know this won’t be easy. I’m not naive. Neither of us are. I know how deep and hard the opposing views are in our country on so many things. But I also know this as well. To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies. We are not enemies. What brings us together as Americans is so much stronger than anything that can tear us apart. So let me be clear. I, we, are campaigning as a Democrats, but I will govern as an American president. The presidency itself is not a partisan institution. It’s the one office in this nation that represents everyone and it demands a duty of care for all Americans. That is precisely what I will do. I will work as hard for those who didn’t vote for me as I will for those who did vote for me. Now, every vote must be counted. No one’s going to take our democracy away from us, not now, not ever. America’s come too far. America’s fought too many battles. America’s endured too much to ever let that happen.(08:45)
We the people will not be silenced. We the people will not be bullied. We the people will not surrender. My friends, I’m confident we’ll emerge victorious. But this will not be my victory alone or our victory alone. It’ll be a victory for the American people, for our democracy, for America. And there will be no blue states and red states when we win, just the United States of America, God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you."

As I said on Saturday, I’m humbled by the trust this country and the American people have placed in me and Vice President Elect Harris. And we’re ready to get to work, addressing the needs of the American people. Today our work begins. It starts with doing everything possible to get the COVID-19 under control so that we can reopen our businesses safely and sustainably, resume our lives and put this pandemic behind us.(00:34)
And we just received positive news in this fight, announcement of progress made for a successful vaccine. Soon, expectation will run the process of [inaudible 00:00:47] and approvals. And the process results must also be grounded in science and fully transparent so the American people can have every confidence in any approved vaccine is safe and effective. At the same time, it’s clear that this vaccine, even if approved will not be widely available for many months yet to come. The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing. And although we are not in office yet, I’m just laying out what we expect to do and hope can be done, some of it between now and the time we are sworn in. So the purpose of this is to let you know what we’re going to do once sworn in.(01:30)
There’s a need for bold action to fight this pandemic. We’re still facing a very dark winter. There are now nearly 10 million COVID cases in the United States. Last week we topped 120,000 new cases on multiple successive days. Infection rates are going up. Hospitalizations are going up. Deaths are going up. This crisis claimed nearly a thousand American lives a day, nearly 240,000 deaths so far. The projections still indicate we could lose 200,000 more lives in the coming months before a vaccine can be made widely available.(02:11)
So we can’t forego the important work that needs to be done between now and then to get our country through the worst wave yet in this pandemic, to reduce the spread, to save lives. So that’s why today I’ve named the COVID-19 Transition Advisory Board comprised of distinguished public health experts to help our transition team translate the Biden-Harris COVID-19 plan into action. A blueprint that we can put in place as soon as Kamala and I are sworn into office on January 20th, 2021. And we will seek to add other members to this board to bring additional important perspective on public health and expertise throughout the transition.(02:56)
This group will advise on detailed plans, built on a bedrock of science and to keep compassion, empathy and care for every American at its core, making rapid testing widely available… More widely available, much more widely available, and building a core of contact tracers who will track and curb this disease while we prioritize getting vaccines first to the most at risk populations, developing clear and detailed guidance, providing the necessary resources for small businesses, schools, childcare centers to reopen and operate safely and effectively during the pandemic, protecting both workers and the public, scaling up productive lifesaving treatments and therapeutics. And when it’s ready, making sure an approved vaccine is distributed equitably and efficiently and free for every American.(03:53)
With cases rising once more, it’s imperative that we ramp up our production of personal protective equipment, to make sure our brave healthcare workers have what they need to do battle safely against this virus. We’re going to get states, cities and tribes, the test and the supplies they need. We’re going to protect vulnerable populations who are at risk, most at risk from this virus, older Americans and those with preexisting conditions. We’re going to address the health and economic disparities that mean this virus is hitting the Black, Latino, Asian American, Pacific Islanders, Native American communities, harder than white communities. Focusing on in these communities is one of our priorities, not an afterthought.(04:39)
The bottom line, I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around once we’re sworn in on January 20th, to get our kids back to school safely, our businesses growing, and our economy running at full speed again, and to get an approved vaccine manufactured and distributed as quickly as possible to as many Americans as possible free of charge. We’ll follow the science, we’ll follow the science. Let me say that again. And we’ll adjust the new data when it comes in and we’ll listen and work in cooperation with governors and local leaders of both parties who are fighting this virus in their communities this very day.(05:23)
There is so much good work happening at state and local levels across the country, governors, mayors, they’re stepping up. The advisory board will listen and learn lessons from their experience. Because we know that we won’t fully defeat COVID-19 until we defeat it everywhere, my advisory council also includes experts on global health security so that we can restore U.S. global leadership to fight this pandemic. This is a crisis that affects everyone.(05:52)
As I’ve said throughout this campaign, I will be a president for every American. This election is over. It’s time to put aside the partisanship and the rhetoric that designed to demonize one another. It’s time to end the politicization of basic responsible public health steps like mask wearing and social distancing. We have to come together to heal the soul of this country so that we can effectively address this crisis, as one country, where hardworking Americans have each other’s backs. And where we’re united in our shared goal, defeating this virus.(06:31)
As we work toward a safe and effective vaccine, we know that the single most effective thing we can do to stop the spread of COVID is wear a mask. The head of the CDC warned this fall, that for the foreseeable future, a mask remains the most potent weapon against the virus. Today’s news does not change that urgent reality. I won’t be president until January 20th, but my message today is to everyone, is this, it doesn’t matter who you voted for, where you stood before election day, it doesn’t matter your party, your point of view, we can save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months. Not Democrat or Republican lives, American lives. Maybe we’d save a life of a person who stocks the shelf at your local grocery store. Maybe saves the life of a member of your place of worship. Maybe saves the lives of one of your children’s teachers. Maybe saves your life.(07:40)
So please, I implore you, wear a mask, do it for yourself, do it for your neighbor. A mask is not a political statement, but it is a good way to start pulling the country together. I want to be very clear, the goal of mask wearing is not to make your life less comfortable or take something away from you. It’s to give something back to all of us, a normal life. The goal is to get back to normal as fast as possible and masks are critical in doing that. It won’t be forever, but that’s how we’ll get our nation back, back up to speed economically. So we can go back to celebrating birthdays and holidays together. So we can attend sporting events together. So we can get back to the lives and connections we shared before the pandemic.(08:36)
It doesn’t matter whether or not we always agree with one another. It doesn’t matter who you voted for. We are Americans and our country is under threat. We’re now called to do the same thing that generations of proud Americans have done when faced with a crisis throughout our history. Rise above our differences to Defend the strength and the vitality of our nation. That’s the character of patriots, that’s the character of America. We have to do this together. Wearing a mask seems like a small act. Maybe you think your individual choice won’t make any difference. Throughout our history, throughout the history of our nation, we’ve seen over and over how small acts add up to enormous achievements. It’s the weight of many small acts together that bend the arc of history.(09:33)
I know there’s nothing that the American people can’t accomplish when we work together, as one people, with one mission. We can get this virus under control, I promise you. We can rebuild our economy back better than it was before. We can address race based disparities that damage our country. It’s in our power. So let’s wear a mask. Let’s get to work. Thank you. May God bless you. And for all those who have lost somebody, our heart goes out to you. We know what it’s like. Our heart goes out to you. May God protect our healthcare workers and all Americans. Thank you."

Good evening, my fellow Americans. We don’t have a final declaration of victory yet but the numbers tell us it’s clear. They tell us a clear and convincing story we’re going to win this race. Just look at what has happened since yesterday. 24 hours we were behind in Georgia, now we’re ahead and we’re going to win that state. 24 hours ago we were behind in Pennsylvania and we are going to win Pennsylvania. And now we’re ahead but we’re winning in Arizona, winning in Nevada, and in fact our lead just doubled in Nevada. We’re on track to over 300 electoral votes, electoral college votes.(00:50)
And look at the national numbers. We’re going to win this race with a clear majority with the nation behind us. We’ve gotten over 74 million votes. Let me repeat that, 74 million votes, that’s more than any presidential ticket has ever gotten in the history of the United States of America. And our vote total is still growing. We’re beating Donald Trump by over 4 million votes, and that’s a margin that is still growing as well.(01:19)
One of the things I’m especially proud of is how well we’ve done across America, and we’re going to be the first Democrat to win in Arizona in 24 years. We’re going to be the first Democrat to win Georgia in 28 years, and we’ve rebuilt the blue wall in the middle of the country that crumbled just four years ago. Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, the heartland of this nation. I know watching these vote tallies on TV moves very slow, and as slow as it goes it can be numbing. But never forget the tallies aren’t just numbers, they represent votes and voters, men and women who exercised their fundamental right to have their voice heard.(02:06)
And what’s becoming clear each hour is that a record number of Americans of all races, faiths religions chose change over more of the same. They’ve given us a mandate for action on COVID, the economy, climate change, systemic racism. They made it clear they want the country to come together not continue to pull apart. The people spoke, more than 74 million Americans and they spoke loudly for our ticket. But while we’re waiting for the final results I want people to know we’re not waiting to get the work done and start the process.(02:48)
Yesterday, Senator Harris and I held meetings with groups of experts on public health and the economic crisis this country is facing. That pandemic as you also know is getting more worrisome all across the country. Daily cases are skyrocketing and it’s now believed that we could see as many as 200,000 cases in a single day. The death toll is approaching 240,000 lives lost to this virus. That’s 240,000 empty chairs at kitchen tables and dining room tables all across America.(03:25)
We’ll never be able to measure all that pain and the loss, the suffering that so many families have experienced. We know something about what it feels like to lose to someone and I want them to know they’re not alone. Our hearts break with you. I want everyone, everyone to know on day one, we’re going to put our plan to control this virus into action. We can’t save any of the lives lost, any of those who have been lost but we can save a lot of lives in the months ahead.(03:59)
Senator Harris and I also heard yesterday about how this recovery is slowing. Because of the failure to get the pandemic under control more than 20 million people are on unemployment. Millions are worried about making rent and putting food on the table. Our economic plan will put a focus on a path to a strong recovery.(04:23)
Look, we both know tensions are high, they can be high after a tough election, the one like we’ve had but we need to remember we have to remain calm, patient. Let the process work out as we count all the votes. We’re proving again what we’ve proved for 244 years in this country, democracy works. Your vote will be counted. I don’t care how hard people try to stop it, I will not let it happen. The people will be heard, our journey is sort of a more perfect union and it keeps moving on.(05:05)
In America, we hold strong views, we have strong disagreements and that’s okay. Strong disagreements are inevitable in a democracy and strong disagreements are healthy, they’re a sign of a vigorous debate of deeply held views. But we have to remember the purpose of our politics isn’t total, unrelenting, unending warfare, no. The purpose of our politics, the work of the nation isn’t to fan the flames of conflict but to solve problems, to guarantee justice, to get to improve the lives of our people.(05:45)
We may be opponents but we’re not enemies, we’re Americans. No matter who you voted for I’m certain of one thing, the vast majority of them, almost 150 million Americans who voted they want to get the vitriol out of our politics. We’re certainly not going to agree on a lot of issues but at least we can agree to be civil with one another. We have to put the anger and the demonization behind us. It’s time for us to come together as a nation to heal. It’s not going to be easy, we have to try.(06:20)
My responsibility as president will be to represent the whole nation. And I want you to know that I’ll work as hard for those who voted against me as those who voted for me, that’s the job, that’s the job, it’s called the duty of care for all Americans. We have serious problems to deal with from COVID to the economy, to racial justice and climate change. We don’t have any more time to waste on partisan warfare.(06:51)
And more than that we have such an incredible opportunity to build a future we want for our kids and our grandkids. I’ve said many, many times, I’ve never been more optimistic about the future of this nation. There is no reason we can’t own the 21st century. We just need to remember who we are, this is the United States of America and there’s never been anything, anything we’ve been unable to do, unable to accomplish when we’ve done it together. I hope to be talking to you tomorrow. I want to thank you all and may God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Good night."
biden_speech_wisconsin.txt,"(04:36)
Well, this young woman is the co-founder of Phoenix, of Sherman Phoenix, in Milwaukee, taking a neighborhood that was beginning to be a part of the ash then, and has brought it back to life miraculously. I am so proud to introduce Joanne Sabir. Come on, girl. (14:08)
I hope you got masks on everyone. It’s cold. Hello Milwaukee, it’s good to be back. I’ll tell you what, they told me it’s going to be indoors. You’re a hardy bunch in Milwaukee. Sheriff, how are you doing? Look, Terrence, thank you. Thank you for sharing your story. Thank you for your exercising your power as a young voter first time. You’re an inspiration man, and I want you to know that a lot of us in here growing up as kids understood what is like to know bullies.(15:04)
I had planned on saying this in light of your introduction, Sheriff and Tom’s heard me say this before, and the mayor. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. You want to learn what bullies are like, be a stuttering kid, talk like that everybody thinks they can make fun of you. So I’m used to bullies. Matter of fact, they used to have a nickname in school, Tom. They used to call me Shoe Leather. The reason they call me Shoe Leather, I was a little [inaudible 00:03:32], but you could beat me, but I’d hurt you. It’s like [inaudible 00:15:36] a shoe leather.(15:37)
But I’ll tell you what, I think you made a great metaphor about what’s going on here. You’re making your family really proud. And Joanne, I want to thank you for all you do to lift up this community, bringing pride and dignity and jobs in Milwaukee. My dad used to have an expression, he lost his job in Scranton, Pennsylvania when I was a kid and he took us to my grand pops, my mom’s dad, my grand mom was passed. And so he said you’re going to live here for about a year. I’m going to commute every day from Scranton, Pennsylvania, down to Wilmington, Delaware, where there’s jobs, Joey and when I get one, I’ll be back for you, and your mom, and your brother and your sister.(16:23)
My sister is with me today too, where’s my sister, Valerie? She’s my best friend in the world. Anyway, Val. And he said, it’s only 157 miles away. Wilmington, Delaware. He’d come home every weekend. And when we got down to Wilmington and he finally got a job, that we could bring us down and be able to rent an apartment, he used to always have an expression Sheriff, he’d say, “You know Joey, a job’s a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay. It’s going to be okay.””(17:06)
As Gwen knows, not an awful lot of people out there right now. A lot of hard working people who can’t say it’s going to be okay, they’re in trouble. Statistics show, for example that over 50% of the American people think actually it’s 49% to be precise, got a bill for 400 bucks in one month they didn’t anticipate, they’d have to borrow the money or sell something. So a lot of people were still hurting. And Gwen, let’s send her back because I tell you what, she is a voice from Milwaukee, a voice from the country, and I’m sure glad you’re on my side, kid. Sure glad you’re on my side because I’m on yours.(17:46)
I want to thank you all for welcoming me today and Tom, you’ve been a good friend and for a long time, thank you pal. Tom endorsed me when they said Joe Who’s running for what? Anyway, but thank you, Tom. And Sheriff Lucas and Sheriff Mahoney, and Ambassador John [Frenz 00:06:06], I want to thank you all for being here, there you are. Okay.(18:09)
Look, it’s great to be back with you. Folks, there was only four days left. Millions of Americans have already voted. They’re telling me now it’s up to about 85 million Americans have already voted and millions more are going to vote before this election is over.(18:26)
And I believe when you use your power, the power to vote, you can change the course of the country and quite frankly, right now the course of the world, because it’s leaderless now. We’re going to start right here in Wisconsin. If Tom remembers, I came up here to campaign for Hillary and for a whole lot of reasons, not all which were her fault ended up not taking it as seriously. We thought it was different. I’ve been here a lot. And by the way, when I got elected, if I get elected, I’m coming back, Tom.(18:59)
Look at these final days, we got to keep our sense of empowerment here. A sense of optimism. What we can do together. But I know it’s hard. More than 225,000 people, I think it’s 229 as I speak, have already lost their lives to COVID-19. 2,000 here in Wisconsin, 600 here in Milwaukee County, each one immortalized by an empty chair this morning at breakfast or tonight at dinner. An empty chair at MacArthur Square. And now folks are getting hit by a new big wave of infections across the country.(19:41)
This week, Wisconsin, like other states set a new record for daily cases. Hospitals are running short on beds, just had to open a field hospital. That’s what we’re facing. We’ve now had nine million cases in the United States of America. We make up 4% of the world’s population,, we have 20% of the world’s deaths, nine million new cases nationwide, another tragic milestone, millions of people out of work, on the edge, and they can’t see the light, they’re not sure how dark it’s going to remain.(20:22)
Wisconsin is down 20,000 manufacturing jobs since this pandemic began. And the thing that bothers me the most was a president who gave up. Over the weekend, his chief of staff said what we knew. “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” We’re not going to control the pandemic.(20:46)
Yet last week when I debated the president, he said, quote, “We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away. We’re learning to live with it.” You may remember what I said it may have been viewed as harsh by some. Told him, we’re not learning to live with it, you’re asking us to learning to die with it, because people continue to die. It’s estimated that over 200,000 more people will die between now and the end of the year by the leading experts who haven’t been wrong yet.(21:16)
Did you hear what he said today? He said today at a rally that our doctors are the problem because they’re putting their lives on the line, busting their necks, he said, they’re making up deaths from COVID-19 because they get more money. They’re making up deaths. People aren’t really dying from COVID, they’re dying from other things, but they’re saying it’s COVID to make the numbers go up. My Lord.(21:51)
By the way, is Monica [Wadry 00:21:53] here? Monica is an ICU nurse. I spent some time with Monica on the phone and her two kids and Monica told me what my son-in-law who’s a doc in Philly told me when this all began. While we’re waiting for PPP, the mask, and the gowns, and all the gear, so many docs, so many nurses, so many first responders after they did their job were afraid to go home because they’d take it home, the virus home to their children.(22:27)
Monica told me how her husband would wait in the garage so she could change and put on a [inaudible 00:22:32] before she went in the house and shower. So many people, over a thousand Monicas have given their lives trying to save other lives. And this guy says that they’re raking it up because they want to make more money.(22:51)
Doctors and nurses go to work every single day, Donald Trump should stop attacking them and start doing his job. This is the same man who told us, when he was told about four weeks ago, three or four weeks ago that we’re losing a thousand lives a day, remember what he said? He said it is what it is. Ain’t that useful? It is what it is. Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. That’s the problem.(23:23)
Donald Trump waved the white flag, surrendered to the virus. But the American people don’t give up. We don’t give in. Unlike Donald Trump, we’re not going to surrender to this virus. We’re simply not going to surrender. Look, I put in place a plan with this pandemic responsibly. I’ve set it up back in May, and then again in June, and in July, the way we can bring this country together around testing, tracing and masking. It’s estimated by leading doctors in America that if we just wore these masks for the remainder of this calendar year-(24:02)
For the remainder of this calendar year, we could save up to another 100,000 lives. Dr. Fauci, who’s been not treated very well by the President, who’s been with three other presidents in the same role, one of the most respected guys in the world, he’s called for a basket mandate. This isn’t a political statement of us wearing these masks. For God’s sake, it’s a patriotic duty.(24:29)
The reason you’re wearing the mask is not to save yourself, but to save your neighbor, the person across from you, the person who you’re next to. But still Donald Trump refuses to listen to the science. He’s politicized the race for vaccine as well. Instead of planning for its safe, equitable, and free distribution, what’s he doing? He’s talking about things that are just not in the rumble possibility, “We’ll have this by September. We’ll have it by…” it goes on.(25:04)
Look folks, he refused to bring leaders, by the way, of both parties together. You know, the House of Representatives, Gwen can tell you, has already passed three major pieces of legislation, two CARES Act, and then the Heroes Act, provides all the money that is necessary to safely open schools and businesses, and do it in a way that they can stay open. But it costs money, look at all the people who’ve gone out of business, all of the small businesses.(25:37)
We know how to open business, we know what to do it safely, but it costs, to open our schools nationwide, it’s estimated it’ll cost $200 billion to do it safely, to provide everybody with the PPE, [inaudible 00:25:50] everybody, change the ventilation systems, make sure you have separators, make sure you are in a position where we have the sanitary conditions that are wiped down, smaller classes, more teachers. But what are we doing? The money’s already been there, they’ve already passed it. What’s happened? The President hasn’t got out of his golf bunker in his golf course in the summer, or the bunker in the White House since then to bring people together.(26:23)
Look, find anybody Democrat or Republican, who served in the Congress, the Senate, the House, ask them can ever remember a time when there’s been a national crisis, and this is a national crisis, but the President hasn’t brought them all together, and said, “We’re staying here until we fix this. We’re going to work it out.” He hadn’t even talked to y’all.(26:49)
Look folks, we’re going to bring the Republicans and Democrats together, and deliver economic relief for working families, and schools, and businesses; I promise you. I know how to do this. As I said before, I’m not going to shut down the economy. I’m going to shut down the virus.(27:08)
Look, Donald Trump inherited a strong economy from Barack and me, but he squandered that economy, just like he squatted everything he’s inherited. Frankly I’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life, guys who think they’re better than you because they have a lot of money, look down on you because they live in a better home. But tell you what, we understand, we understand how this works. Folks, the people who built this country weren’t Wall Street, and investment bankers, and CEOs, they were hard working Americans, middle class folks, working class folks, who built the middle class, and unions built the middle class.(27:57)
We know, as Gwen said, we can build back better, with an economy that rewards work not well. Right now it rewards wealth, not work. We can do without raising taxes on any [inaudible 00:28:10] working person in the middle-class. I give you my word as a Biden, if you make less than $400,000, if I’m elected president, you’re not going to see a penny of your taxes go up, not a penny.(28:23)
He keeps lying about my plan, but I tell you what, I’m going to ask the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations, by the way 91 of the fortune 500 companies pay no tax at all, zero, zero tax. They make billions of dollars.(28:45)
Folks, it’s about time people start paying their fair share. It’s not a punishment. Pay your fair share. Why should a firefighter, why should a sheriff, why should a cop, why shouldn’t educator, why should a nurse pay a higher tax rate, which you do, then they pay? You do that, you pay a higher tax rate.(29:09)
And by the way, why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump? 750 bucks. This guy loves talking about corruption. I’ve released 22 years of my tax returns. You can go online and see them. And guess what? He hadn’t released one single year of his tax returns. What the hell was he hiding? What’s in there? Working families and middle-class people, you need help, they need help. Particularly first-time home buyers, being able to pay for a healthcare premium, childcare, carefree for your aging loved ones.(29:51)
Just to get a new hot water, and I don’t know about you, but the kitchen tables I was raised around, you’re sitting there, and I can hear my dad now, “Well, we can’t get those four new tires, you’re going to have to ride on those bald tires a little while longer till we get by next month; when that hot water heater goes out, what are we going to do?” Who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to the community college because you don’t have the money. They are the conversations taking place all across America today, and what’s Trump trying to do? Raise your cost for standard of living.(30:26)
He’s going to be in the Supreme Court, even if we win, he’ll still be the Supreme Court, in nine days, or 10 days, asking the Supreme Court, with our new justice, who was put on the court for the purpose of destroying the Affordable Care Act, to rip it out root and branch, eliminate it all.(30:52)
If they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose protections for preexisting conditions, including 2.5 million Wisconsinites, 2.5. So if you have diabetes, you ever had cancer, if you had breast… whatever it is, whatever your previous condition, you won’t be able to afford it because they can jack up the price beyond your capacity. Women will once again, once again, be charged more for the same health care that a man is charged for just because they’re a woman. People forget that that’s what it was before we passed the Affordable Care Act.(31:34)
Look, Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege; I think it’s a right people should have. If we all get out and vote, we’ll not only restore Obamacare, but we’ll strengthen and build on it. So you can keep your private insurance, or you could choose a Medicare-like option that will add to Obamacare, which we tried, which we wanted to do the first time, but couldn’t get the votes. We’ll increase subsidies to lower your premiums and deductibles, out of pocket spending, and surprise billings.(32:08)
And we will reduce the cost of prescriptions by 60%. I’m not making that up. That comes from saying, we’re going to insist, and we have the votes to do it in this next election, that Medicare can negotiate with the drug companies to say how much they’re going to be willing to pay for whatever drug they have. Look, folks, we’re going to make sure we keep the protections for people with pre-existing conditions.(32:33)
Meanwhile, social security, the actuary of social security has said, if Donald Trump gets reelected, he says he’s going to change social security, based on the changes he wants to make the actuary and social security said, “Social security will be bankrupt by 2023.” I’m not making this stuff up, it’s real. Folks, I’m going to protect social security, Medicare, and Medicaid. And guess what? He’s not going to be able to do it because we’re going to win this election.(33:08)
Look, let’s not forget how weak Donald Trump has been, and chaotic. He talks about trade policy, my God, what a disaster he’s been. Trump’s trade policy has decimated, devastated the Wisconsin dairy industry. In 2017 to 2019, Wisconsin lost 15% of its dairy farms, and last year Wisconsin lost more dairy farms in any state in the nation. Since the start of the trade war, Wisconsin has seen mass lay off surge by 25%. And even before COVID hit, Wisconsin saw big declines in manufacturing jobs.(33:56)
After Trump rolled out his irresponsible tax giveaways, Harley Davidson slashed 800 manufacturing jobs, repurchased almost $700 million of its own stock so the corporate heads could get and make a lot more money, and none of it went to the employees, and then shifted some of its production overseas; so much for helping.(34:23)
Look, my policies… Right now, by the way, the deficit with China is higher than it was in our administration. Look, at the end of the Trump tax loopholes that incentivized companies to ship jobs overseas, these new laws just got passed for real, adds 10%, I’m going to add a 10% surtax to any company to ships jobs overseas. And companies that invest and strengthen the American manufacturing, or bring jobs back home, we’re going to offer a 10% tax credit.(34:55)
And by the way, the president of United States awards over $600 billion in contracts a year for our military, for all the things we build, federal buildings, well it’s not a violation of any trade law, no one’s done it, but I promise you I’m going to do it; not a single solitary contract will be awarded, unless all the products used by that contractor are made in America, all of them, right here in America.(35:28)
And by the way, when I talk about my economic plan, it’s not some liberal think tank that talks about how good it is; Moody’s, a Wall Street major firms pointed out, after looking at my plan for the economy and his, that we will create 18.6 million jobs under the Biden plan, a trillion dollars more in GDP than Trump. Folks look, the fact is that we’re now in a situation where this President is in a-(36:03)
We’re now in a situation where this President is in a position that he doesn’t know what he’s doing. If you notice, if you notice what Donald Trump has spent a lot of time doing, he spent a lot of time rolling out irresponsible corporate tax cuts. In the meantime, do you realize that during this pandemic, the billionaires in America, billionaires, they’re all listed, have made over $300 billion more? $300 billion more? How about you guys? You’re all doing great, right? You got all that money. Look, folks. We’re in a situation where the President now finds himself… The thing that bothers me most about all he’s done is the way he talks about our military being suckers and losers. Think about this. A lot of you women and men served in the military. A lot of us [inaudible 00:36:58] served. My son Bo gave up the Attorney General’s job in the state of Delaware to volunteer to go to Iraq for a year. He won the Bronze Star, the conspicuous service medal. He came home with cancer after being near [inaudible 00:00:37:14]. He came home anyway. He was given months to live, and guess what? He wasn’t a loser. He wasn’t a sucker. He was a patriot, just like your sons and daughters, your parents and grandparents. Look, folks. If you ever wonder, Trump keeps talking about how strong he is. He’s strong and the rest of the nations listen to him. Everybody’s afraid of him. Well, let me tell you what. He’s the first President I’m aware of in American history that six generals, including his former Chief of Staff, six of them left, resigned, and said he wasn’t fit to be Commander in Chief.(37:59)
General Stanley McChrystal, Special Operations Commander. He’s the guy oversaw the Bin Laden raid. Bill McRaven, and 22, he oversaw. He was a SEAL. He head up the SEALs. And 22 4-Stars have endorsed me, saying they trust me to be the next Commander in Chief of the United States Military. Folks, it’s about respect. It’s about support, and that’s why the Military Times, which his staff tried to wipe out, Military Times just wrote an article saying more active duty troops support Biden than Trump. So much for the guy who talks about what a tough guy he is and why everybody listens to him. Look, that’s why we have to support the military, and we have to make sure we considerably invest more, which I don’t have to take the time to talk to you tonight about, but invest significantly more in dealing with the Veterans Administration.(39:08)
While Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy, we can vote to deliver racial justice. Folks, a season of protest has broken out all over this nation, and protesting is not burning and looting and violence, and must never be tolerated and won’t. That’s not protesting. But those protests are cries for justice. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, they’re not going to soon be forgotten. Not by me, not by us, not by this country. We have to vote to meet the challenge of climate crisis as well. More frequent, extreme weather. Literally, the planet’s at stake. We’re told the number of years before it’s irreversible is getting narrower and narrower. The West is on fire. More forest land has been burned to the ground than the entire square miles of Rhode Island and Connecticut combined.(40:11)
The Midwest is flooding. Here in Wisconsin, extreme weather incurs big cost for your infrastructure. Lake Michigan set a record high this past January, and the South and East hurricanes are more severe. Oceans are rising. My state’s only three feet above sea level, literally. People are worried what happens if we don’t change this. Folks, Donald Trump thinks that when you say climate change, he says hoax. Well, this stable genius, as he calls himself, also thinks that wind power causes cancer. The way to stop hurricanes coming across the warm Atlantic from Africa is to maybe drop a nuclear bomb on them. The same stable genius said the problem we had in the Revolutionary War, we didn’t have enough airports. And of the Revolutionary War, God saved the… Anyway.(41:09)
Look, when I hear climate change, I think the health of our children, the security of the planet, and I also think it creates jobs. Jobs here in Wisconsin, all across the country. Folks, combating climate change means saving the planet, protecting our health, and creating millions of good-paying jobs, union jobs right here in Milwaukee and all across America. We can change the path we’re on, but we have to act now, because we can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump. This election, I promise you, your grandkids are going to write about how it set the path for at least the generation here in America.(41:55)
You know, in 2008 and 2012, we came to y’all, Barack and me, and we asked for your help. You helped us, and each day we were in office, we worked for you and the entire country. I’m going to do that again. My 2020 campaign is a broad coalition. We welcome Democrats and Republicans and Independents. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. There will be no blue States or red States, just the United States. I’ll work as hard for those who vote against me as those who voted for me, because that’s what a president is supposed to do. The duty to care. The duty to care for everyone.(42:44)
Look, you too have a sacred duty to vote. It matters. Wisconsin matters. So if you haven’t already, and most of you probably have, make a plan, vote. Get out the vote. If you’ve already voted, get your mom, dad, brother, sister, neighbor. Get them to vote. Go to iwillvote.com/wi. You’ve got to get it done to make sure everyone knows where to vote, when to vote. Look, a press article yesterday, speaking of Donald Trump, two days ago, actually, said, and I quote, “Never before in modern presidential politics has a candidate been so reliant on wide-scale efforts to depress the vote as Donald Trump.” So let’s be careful here. Guess what? He’s not going to be able to stop us, not at all. As I said, he’ll not silence the over 85 million people who have already voted. They’ve had enough. People are coming out in droves, waiting three, four, five, six hours in other states just to vote. Let me conclude by saying I’l never forget the phrase used by President Kennedy when he decided to send us to the moon, get to the moon. He said, when asked why, he said, “We refuse to postpone. We’re the United States of America. We refuse to postpone the incredible opportunities available to the American people.” I refuse to postpone the enormous possibilities we have. I’ve been around a while, but I’d never been more optimistic about America’s chances than I am today. I really mean it. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. Nothing. There’s no limit to what America can do. We’re the only country in the history of the world that’s come out of every crisis stronger than when we went in.(44:53)
The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself, and that’s exactly what Donald Trump has been doing from the beginning of his campaign, last time out. Dividing America, pitting Americans against one another based on race, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity. It’s wrong. That’s not who we are. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s let them know who we are, who we are in the last four days. We choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction, and yes, truth over lies.(45:40)
So folks, it’s time to stand up and take back our democracy. We can do this. We’ll be better than we been. We can be who we want to be at our best, the United States of America. I promise you, we can do this. You helped me get there. I promise you, I’ll take responsibility. When I make a mistake, I’ll acknowledge it, but I will take responsibility and I won’t let you down. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Thanks, everybody. I appreciate it. You’ve got to be freezing. All right. They’re telling me I’m going this way."

The country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us. Leadership that brings us together. I look at the presidency as very big job and nobody will get it right every time. And I won’t either, but I promise you this, I won’t traffic in fear and division. I won’t fan the flames of hate. I’ll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain. I’ll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won’t blame others. I promise you, this job is not about me. It’s about you. It’s about us to build a better future. That’s what America does. We build the future. It may in fact be the most American thing to do. This is the United States of America. There’s never been anything we’ve been unable to do when we set our mind to do it, and we’ve done it together. (02:28)
I’m doing well, thank you for doing this. (03:48)
Well, George Floyd’s last words spoke to a nation, where the color of your skin dictates the safety and your future. And as long past time that these words have to be acted upon. Look, let me make something clear. I’m a white man. I think I understand, but I can’t feel it. I mean, I feel it, but I don’t know what it’s like to be a black man walking down the street and be accosted. Being a black man, walking down the street, be arrested. Be a black man, walking down the street, and God forbid something worse happened to me.(04:28)
If we just let this wound scab over again, it’s never going to heal. As I said, George Floyd’s last words didn’t die with him. They’re echoing all across the country. And I think they speak onto to a nation where you have over 108,000 people who’ve lost their lives to a virus now. 40 million Americans have filed for… over 40 million for unemployment. A disproportionate number of the coronavirus cases and job losses are on African American and Latino communities. Matter of fact, Latino community even have a higher unemployment rate, lost jobs. The moment, it seems to me, it’s a wake up call for everybody, for all of us.(05:06)
And the moment I think has for our nation to deal with the systemic racism, to deal with the growing economic inequity in our nation. And to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation for so many. Early in the week, I laid out initial steps I thought that Congress should take immediately as it related to police conduct, outlaw choke hold, stop transfer weapons of war, meaning those Humvees and the rest, to dealing with armored vehicles to a police departments, improve oversight and accountability. Create a model use of force standard, because the country is crying out for leadership and the President of the United States must be part of the solution, not part of the problem.(05:46)
And it’s my commitment to all of you as president, I’m going to lead on these issues and I’m going to listen. And let me just say, you asked why I’m optimistic still. I’m optimistic because one of the things I learned is that… and you’re not as old, but we’re older, that I thought we had made enormous progress when we finally elected an African American president. I thought things had really changed. But what I didn’t realize is what the historian says is that it’s a constant pull and tug in America. America is not a fairy tale. The constitution is not a fairy tale. It’s a constant struggle between good and evil as to who is going to prevail.(06:28)
And I believe in my heart of hearts that we can overcome and what if we stand together. And finally, as one America, we’re going to rise stronger than we were before, but here’s the deal. You can never… I’ve gone on too long. I apologize. Let me just say this. (06:44)
One of the things that I think is important is that I thought you could defeat hate… Excuse me. I thought you could defeat hate. That you could kill hate, but the point is you can’t. Hate only hides. And if you breathe any oxygen into that heat, it comes alive again. And the words of a president matter. And when I saw those folks, I hadn’t planned on running for president again, Don, for real, until I saw those folks coming out of the fields in Charlottesville, carrying those torches and chanting the same antisemitic vile they chanted in Nuremberg and in Berlin and in Germany in the thirties.(07:26)
And then a young woman was killed there, accompanied by white supremacists. And the president was asked, “What do you think?” And he said something no president has ever said. He said that, “There were fine people on both sides.” The point is this is a constant struggle. We have to constantly fight it though. As Martin Luther King talked, that arch does bend toward justice, but you got to fight it. You got to fight it. It will never be defeated. And this is a case where I think as we move as one, and I think the American people are ready to move. Black, white, Latino, Asian. I think they’re ready to move. We can, in fact, push it back. And if we stay vigilant. I really am hopeful, especially with the generation of young people we’re going to hear from you today. Their generation is the most engaged, least prejudice, most open, most well-educated generation in history. So I’m hopeful. (09:14)
Hi, Nila. (11:09)
I say, I see you. I hear you. And I’m angry as well, but we have to turn our anguish into purpose and use this moment to finally drive real change to our laws and our institutions and our culture. As I said, history teaches us that out of some of our darkest moments, we’ve made our greatest progress. Reverend Barber said it I think best. He said, ” In the mourning,” meaning when you mourn. “We find hope. In the mourning, we find hope.” We need an era of action that reverses systemic racism and it’s long overdue. And with concrete changes, I can’t wait until I’m president to get started. Right now, though, we have to move. We have to urge Congress to take action now, no excuses, no more delays. Outlaw choke holds, stop transfers of weapons, I said, destruction to police departments. Improve oversight and accountability.(12:01)
Create a model use force standard. As I said, within the first 100 days, I’m going to create a national police oversight commission. And the vast majority of police are decent and honorable, black and white and Latino. And they in fact are worried about the culture as well. I’ve long believed that we need real community policing, meaning that they have to get to know, get out of their vehicles, know the people in the communities. We need to review our hiring practices, our training practice, our deescalation practices and hold bad cops accountable. Hold bad cops accountable. We need economic justice as well. You know that as well as I do. We have more to say this the coming days. But to start, Congress must fix the racial disparity in the COVID recovery funds. Right now, those funds aren’t going to the right place.(12:50)
We need to pay essential workers, not just praise them. We have to pay them. And they tend to be minorities. We have to protect and expand Obamacare. He’s trying to get rid of it in the moment we need healthcare so badly. There’s so much work to do, not just in the presidency, but in my presidency, assuming I get elected, but in a generation. But I promise you I’m going to lead and I’m going to listen. And what are some of the things that we have to do?(13:14)
Well, there’s many things, but I think… Let me conclude your question by saying that your generation has gotten a real kick in the teeth. I have two granddaughters. I had one who just graduated from law school. I have another granddaughter who’s a rising senior in Philly as well. And I have a second granddaughter’s who’s a rising sophomore and this whole 9/11 generation all the way through the Z generation and the early millennials. From the time you got started, you’ve been in a position where the people who graduated six years before you graduated in a gigantic recession. They had great opportunities, but what happened? They didn’t have access to the jobs, the jobs weren’t there, no matter what your color, but particularly if you were an African American.(14:01)
And then now what’s happening with his COVID crisis, as well as the fact that we have this incredible unemployment rate, what’s happening now? I know my granddaughter had a great job out of law school. They told her you can’t come. You got to wait until March for things to start. I mean, no graduations. It’s just put your generation in a place where there’s reason to be concerned and angry well beyond, but including, dealing with systemic racism. And I think the country’s ready because the blinders have been taken off and they’ve seen the people who’ve been carrying the rest of the country and their back have been what we now call essential workers, people in minority communities, people who are driving everything from disinfecting operating rooms to the nurses, to making sure the grocery stores are open. They’re not only the people who are carrying us on their back, they’re the people dying and people didn’t know it before. They didn’t know it before.(15:02)
So I think they’re ready to deal with some of the systemic problems, starting with systemic racism. I really believe they’re ready for us to move. I think we have a gigantic opportunity to create real opportunity in the next four years. (15:35)
The answer is I know Eric, he’s a first rate… He’s on the [inaudible 00:15:39] of my campaign, as a matter of fact. He’s a first rate mayor and I think it makes sense. Some places, they’re short on having enough people to cover the community or others the police departments have a lot more than they need. And so it depends on the community, but it’s all about treating people with dignity, just treating people with dignity period. And sitting down-(16:03)
People with dignity period and setting down basic fundamental rules that relate to what constitutes adequate and fair police conduct. That’s what we have to focus on in my view. (16:34)
Good to see you, man. (17:27)
Because I love people, you and I … I’ve been to your place twice for extended periods of time. What you didn’t say is it’s not only African-Americans, look at all the white leaders you’ve attracted. Look at all the people you’ve attracted to becoming part of a community, part of a larger community. I sat there, I don’t know. I guess I was in your place, maybe a total of six, seven hours, total of two times everything. I watched, I went around to the tables. People were there, there were religious leaders, black and white using your place together. There were young entrepreneurs, black and white and Asian looking at your place to gather. It’s about doing things together. The fact is that, look, I have never found it to be the case where my judgment about someone, whether I care about them has anything other than to do with their humanity.(18:15)
My dad used to have a saying for it. He said, “Joey, everybody’s entitled to be treated with dignity no matter what the circumstance.” I have no idea what it’s like to be treated in a prejudice way as a black man. But I do know what it’s like to be humiliated because when I was a kid, I used to stutter like that. I’m used to bullies. I’m used to people who take advantage of people. I’m used to people who in fact, just try to exert power for their own egotistical reasons. That’s the part of me in my household, you could never, ever, ever, ever, ever say, you get in a fight with somebody. You could never say anything about them that was true. You couldn’t say if they were 300 pounds, you couldn’t say you’re fat. You couldn’t say you’re skinny. You shouldn’t say you’re short.(19:02)
You could say if they are brilliant, you can say you’re dumb, but you could never say anything that they had nothing to do with having to have put upon themselves. (19:19)
Well, yeah, yeah, you did but all kidding aside, Don, I mean, if we ever turned and said something, if somebody was homely and they did something really mean, and you said you’re ugly, you’d be in real trouble in my house. For real. None of my kids, my grandkids, it’s a tradition in our family because you know what it’s like to be victimized. I’m not equating it to being a black man, but I’m equating realizing who it is you care about. Everybody. I really do believe, I mean, I don’t want to proselytize, but I do believe we’re all God’s children for real. I really believe that. I believe we’re all created equal. The problem is, are we all going to be treated equally? It’s about being treated equally. The president of the United States must be part of the solution, not part of the problem. I’m not going to fan the flames of hate. I’m going to speak to heal racial differences. Look, I may conclude this by saying, because I want to get in a larger conversation with everybody conclude it by saying this.(20:26)
I think that if you think about it, the words of a president matter no matter who the president is. A president of United States can send a nation to war. It can bring peace. He can or she can make the market go up or down. He can also make people, he can encourage people to do bad things. What he or she says, how many of your friends do you know who have children who when the president comes on there, they pull them away from the TV? Not a joke. Think about it, think about it. It really matters. It really matters. Hate didn’t begin with Donald Trump. It’s not going to end with him. The history of our country is not a fairy tale. It doesn’t guarantee a happy ending, but as I said, we’re in a battle for the soul of this nation. That has been a constant push and pull for over 200 years.(21:20)
I call every American, ask themselves, ask them [inaudible 00:21:24] okay, is this who we are what we’re seeing now? Is this who we want to be? Is this what would pass onto our kids and our grandkids? I’ll do my job and take responsibility, but I won’t blame others. I’ll never forget that job isn’t about me. It’s about you. Is that how we’re teaching our kids? I work not only to rebuild this nation, but to build a better, stronger, more inclusive, more resilient than it really was. Look, if elected, my view is that you will have to, we’ll have to address these issues straight on, and the words the president says matter. When a president stands up and divides people all the time, you’re going to get the worst of us to come out, the worst in us all to come out.(22:09)
This president constantly talks about equality without lecturing, talks about and has administration that looks like the country and the rest. It changes attitudes. It’s about the attitude of the country. Do we really think this as good as we can be as a nation? I don’t think the vast majority of people think that. They’re probably anywhere from 10 to 15% of the people out there that are just not very good people, but that’s not who we are. The vast majority of people are decent. We have to appeal to that and we have to unite people, bring them together. Bring them together. (24:26)
Look, historic black colleges and universities have done so much with so little. That’s why I proposed for over a year, I’m going to invest $70 billion in HBCUs and minority-serving institutions. I’m going to ease student debt crisis by that particularly impacts now on African-Americans. Historically, black colleges and universities play a vital role in their communities and the country. They educate more than their fair share of low income and first generation students. My state, Delaware State University graduates nearly half of our state’s black college students. By the way, the president of Delaware State University used to work for me now. He was on my staff and I encouraged him to move on and he’s now the president of Delaware State University. He and I spent a lot of time at Howard, as you may know at Howard University as well, they’ve done so much with so little but severely under resourced for much too long.(25:22)
Now, as president, I’m going to make sure HBCUs get the funds they deserve. Invest over $70 billion in research centers to tackle challenges from climate change to cancer, high-tech labs and facilities, internships, and other programs for graduate students. Look, one of the things that happens if you take a look at the state universities, the University of Michigan or whatever state university where an HBCU is, you take a look at them. The reason why they compete for billions of dollars in government contracts, and the government contracts to deal with with major issues that relate to the future and training the best high quality people in technology, savvy people in the world. What we did by the way in our administration, we took money that we went down for example, the deal with the whole issue of what we’re going to do with what’s going on in terms of the illegal eavesdropping by the Chinese and the Russians and others on the American system and how we’re going to deal with it.(26:24)
We went down and provided money to set up laboratories and to graduate people out of HBCU near Roanoke, Virginia. What were we doing that for? They’ll have an opportunity to have high paying jobs and they get out in the sciences. University of Delaware does a lot of work. They have millions of dollars in contracts dealing with metallurgy to get into develop high end and very lightweight steel. For example, metallurgy that relates to allowing aircraft carriers to have thinner decks, they can go faster, but still handle the plane. There’s all kinds of medical research as well, but they need the laboratories and the infrastructure because you don’t have the endowments for that. I’m going to cut the cost of education for everyone. I’m going to fight to make sure the student debt crisis, which disproportionately affects African-Americans, we’re going to immediately forgive now, immediately forgive now, and Nancy Polosi put it in, $10,000 per person in any federal student loan. As president, I’m going to double Pell grants from six to $12,000.(27:29)
I’m going to have the cap on the student loan repayment. Instead of 5%, 10% of disposable income is 5% of your yearly income. I’m going to fix existing public service loan forgiveness programs, forgive $10,000 a year for five years for all those and all the remaining debt after after 10 years, if in fact you engage in public service. Forgive loans for any public college or private HBCU graduate making less, and a family making less than $125,000 a year. Forgiving loans, wipe them out completely. College degrees shouldn’t be the only path though to the middle class. I’m going to invest in partnerships between high schools and community college. My wife use to be a professor at the community college for years and businesses, so the students can earn industry credentials before they graduate. I’m going to offer two-year community college debt free.(28:18)
Look, it’s true, you can’t … I guess what I’m saying is that there’s so much we can do to give the African-American community and HBCUs in particular, an opportunity to do what they do best. Look at all the confidence you got going to an HBCU, to going to Howard. Most of my friends who I grew up with in here in town in Delaware, were African-Americans, became very successful. First, their kids get into the Harvards and the Yales and the Penns of the world. They go to HBCUs and they go to the graduate schools that are the Ivy League or the prestigious graduate schools. It really has a way of not only looking out for, but dealing with and encouraging and keeping African-Americans in school.(29:09)
Last point I’ll make is, my wife teaches at a predominantly minority classes in overwhelmingly, some are foreign students as well, at Northern Virginia Community College. Well, a lot of the students, you give free community colleges [inaudible 00:29:24] and they still can’t attend because they don’t have the money to be able to pay for the food, the books, the board, I mean, if they have to drive there or stay there. That’s why I’m going to double Pell grants from six to $12,000 to give real opportunity to people, genuine opportunity, but the HBCUs are the flagship, everybody forgets the reason they exist. They exist because you weren’t able to go to any other schools because of prejudice, because of segregation. It’s about time we set it right, give them the same foundation to build off of with laboratories and the like that every other major university has. (30:39)
By the way, Don, it was predicted just even before this crisis, that the economy was likely to slow overall because the graduates of the last 10 years and now, find themselves behind the eight ball, not having the jobs they thought they were going to have and losing time with student debt. Instead of being able to go make a down payment on the house, they got a $30,000 debt for going to a public university. I’m not talking about private universities, that’s a different issue. That’s a different issue. We got to figure out … We need that help, that $10,000 help now across the board.(31:14)
What happens is 85% of our economy is driven by consumption, consumers, and if this generation doesn’t have the money to buy houses, buy cars, take care of their major initiatives and bill, then we’re not going to grow at the same rate. It’s not only in the interest of the student with debt, like I graduated, I’m the first one in my family to go to college. It was a lot cheaper, but I was able to work and get through it and pay off the debt. My generic point is that you got to give people a shot. It’s an interest of everybody, everybody that in fact, we have more students getting degrees in the areas that we need people to grow on, and everybody.(32:03)
… and everybody. (32:27)
By the way congratulations, Alderman. I did the same thing, I became a council person, but it’s the same kind of principle. But they know where you live, it’s a hard job. (34:21)
Well, there’s a number of things. Let me start off by saying again, congratulations to what you do. We have something in common. I was listed for all the years I was a Senator as the poorest man in the United States Congress. No, I’m not joking. When I did my financial disclosure as Vice President, one of the folks in the press said, “It’s probable no man has ever assumed the office of vice president with fewer assets than Joe Biden.” I hope he wasn’t talking about intellectual assets.(34:50)
So my generic point is that I got involved because of civil rights in the ’60s and I’m a lifetime member of NAACP. They embraced me and the black church embraced me in my city and that’s how I got started and they gave me confidence to think maybe I could do something. Maybe I could do something. And like I said, I’m the first United States Senator I ever knew, it wasn’t like I… the most impressive person I ever knew in terms of stature was the family doctor. I didn’t know a banker, I didn’t know a lawyer. We didn’t grow up poor, but we grew up, I guess technically lower middle class. But my generic point is this: It gave me confidence. It gave me confidence that maybe I could change things and maybe change things a lot.(35:45)
I remember there’s a film somebody did about me and it had a picture of me with my mother and my mother asking what I wanted to do when I grew up. I said, “I just want to be somebody. I want to make a difference.” And it’s like both of you guys on the screen right now, you want to make a difference. Let me just do something worthwhile.(36:06)
And so for too long the deck’s been stacked against black Americans and today we’re bearing the brunt of that, of our COVID and economic crisis in the black community and it presents, this crisis opportunity, to rebuild a stronger, a more inclusive and I think more resilient middle-class. If you live in a home built by the same builder my home is built in, your home is going to be undervalued, valued less than mine. Schools are underfunded, the poverty rate is still twice what it is for white Americans among black Americans. Black workers disproportionately have low wage jobs without benefits and seeing the worst layoffs to today, right now. Experts predicted a disproportionate number of minority owned businesses won’t get any stimulus loans and the automation will displace African American/Latino workers at higher rates than it will white workers.(37:01)
So my plan for African Americans to close the wealth gap is to invest in African American home ownership. That includes my insisting that there will be a $15,000 first time home buyer tax credit for everyone. Which means that you know the bank will lend you the money because they know you’re going to get that down payment because it’s a tax credit, no matter what you make. Doubling the funding for the Obama/Biden state small business credit. For example, we set up a $1.5 trillion private window in small business drawing billions more, almost $30 billion of capital came in to sustain that $1.5. I’d double that to $3 billion a year.(37:48)
Support black workers in their fight for equal pay and labor rights and safe workplaces. Address maternal mortality that disproportionally impacts African American women, even African American women with means, with means, they’re the last to be… You go in the emergency room, you end up being the last one waited on. The last one taken care of. And so there’s a lot of institutional changes we can make, but we have to provide the ability… let me end it this way.(38:18)
The reason I ran for the county office, like you ran as an alderman, was to end red lining, end red lining. And so when Congress came along and the Democrats passed that $2 trillion proposal to stimulate the economy and the CARES Act, I said at the time what’s going to happen is the banks are supposed to lend to small businesses, right? Well guess what? 40% of the money for small businesses never went there because the big banks don’t… and this is cost free to the big banks, okay? We bailed them out before, okay? They’ve been bailed out. They’re supposed to lend the money. They weren’t willing to lend money to small businesses because unless you had an account with them already, you had credit with them already or you had a credit card, that wasn’t the way it’s supposed to work.(39:07)
We have a mainstream business loan program that has billions of dollars in it. Not one penny has been loaned out yet. Not one. Not one penny, not one. We’re in a situation where… what the bottom line is, we’ve got to change and insist the way in which we deal with the African American and the Latino community is just fundamentally different. And the Asian Pacific Islander community, we have to make sure they have the same access.(39:38)
So if you want to do business in the community, you’ve got a loan in that community, you’ve got to be engaged in that community. We can set up legislation that does that. The House is trying to do that right now. So it’s all about, ultimately, you being able to accumulate wealth. And how do most people accumulate wealth, to change their circumstance? In the housing they have, in the investment they have. And that’s why I call for a multibillion dollar investment in housing. And because look at all of the places that African Americans and poor folks are being… where neighbors are being gentrified, they can’t afford the housing. They can’t afford it at all. They can’t afford to have a house in Los Angeles, San Francisco, suburban Chicago, parts of Philly. So we’ve got to change the housing voucher system we have as well. No one should have to pay more than 30% in terms of what their rent is. And on top of all that, we’ve got to change the institutional structures. I know this is going on long, so long, but there’s so much we can do and I think we will do.(40:46)
For example, if you’re a single mom working, or even if you’re… I was a single dad for a while, raising children, it’s hard and I was making a good salary. I was a Senator, I was making $42, 000 a year after my wife and daughter got killed, raising two boys and I had help. I couldn’t afford any childcare. I didn’t have the money for it, couldn’t do it. You should have childcare. We should be in a position where you are able to have family leave and get paid for family leave.(41:13)
A lot of things that can change the quality of life for people and put them in a position where they’re not the ones that have to go out and do that $5 an hour job and leave their kids behind, et cetera. There’s a lot we can do. And with your help, we’re going to get it done. I really mean it, I’m confident the American people have finally… the bandaid has been ripped off, they’ve seen the people doing all the work for us and a lot of them are saying, “I didn’t know that, I didn’t know they had to do that.” Now’s the time to strike while we have a chance. (43:49)
God love you. Absolutely positively you affect the quality of life of people in your districts more than the Senator does whomever he or she is. I mean, you really do. It matters. (45:06)
Well, first of all, I want to tell you about this young guy. He is a very talented fellow. My daughter is a social worker. My daughter ran the criminal justice reform operation here in Delaware. She has her master’s in work and Keith wrote a really good book and she’s so honored and so am I, he dedicated it to her, to Ashley Biden. And I want to thank you for doing that. You got it right. You figured out who the really smart Biden in the family is, it’s Ashley. No, I really mean it. Thank you.(45:37)
Now look, Keith, here’s the deal. The federal government can do a lot to affect policy at a local level, but it ultimately is affected at the local level. It’s ultimately affected, I know you’re running for the Senate and you know a couple of the folks who work with me as well are now sitting senators in the African American community. And I, as a federal official, cannot tell the state that it can or cannot do certain things.(46:12)
For example, of all the people behind bars in the United States of America, 93 out of 100 are behind a county prison bar or a state prison bar. And so what Barack and I did, we worked like hell to get 39,000 people out of federal prisons and what I’m proposing is we provide for incentives to get the states to reduce their prison populations.(46:39)
For example, no one should be going to jail for a drug abuse problem. They should be going into mandatory rehab. That’s why I wrote the bill that required that there be drug courts. We don’t need to build more prisons, we need to build more drug rehab facilities, mandatory rehab facilities. Because drug is a problem and it is a problem for the person who has the addiction.(47:06)
Two, we should make sure that anybody gets out of jail, we can’t dictate this, we can do this for federal prisons, but I’m going to try to incentivize states to do it by giving them extra money. Anyone who in fact gets out of prison and is served their time, should automatically be eligible for every program that exists in the federal government. Right now, they can’t get a Pell Grant to go to school, right now they can’t get public housing. Right now they can’t… I could go down the list. They’re denied every single thing. And you know, I’ve made these speeches in the [Gold Bar 00:47:44] with the big high paying business guys. I tell them it’s it’s in their interest, their interest that we pay money and our taxes, to see to it that someone can be rehabilitated.(47:57)
Right now all that happens is you get out of prison and you get $25 bucks and you-(48:03)
You get 25 bucks and you get a bus ticket. You end up under the Third Street bridge. That’s what happens. But if you’re able to come out and qualify to go on get a student loan to go because you qualified to go for free to Del State or to community college or wherever you are able to get into, and you can get Pell grants at 12,000 grand a year, you can begin to build your life. And we also should be in a position where anyone convicted, for example, of a marijuana conviction, automatically that should be expunged so when you get asked a question, “Have you ever been convicted?” You can honestly say, “No,” because you have to put it down now on a job application, right? There’s a whole range of things we could be doing.(48:50)
Why does it not make sense that since we know one thing that all criminals have, “convicted” people have in common that go to jail on balance, regardless of their race, is they’re not very good readers. They don’t have much of an education. And they tend to, if they’re violent criminals, come from a family where they were physically abused or they saw their mother abused. Why does it not make sense to deal with those problems while they are in prison? Why not have drug rehab in prison if it’s another crime for what you went, but you have a drug problem? That’s not why you’re there. Why does it not make sense? I think you may have helped Ashley try to get the provision passed, where she got the criminal justice outfit to buy a tire store. Train people in prison to know how to change and fix tires, retread tires, by the facility, the state by the facility, train them while they are there so they have a job waiting for them when they get out.(49:59)
Why don’t we do that? We’re spending money the wrong way. We shouldn’t be building any more prisons. And that’s why I opposed the provision in the bill that I had passed that provided more money for state prisons, no more federal prisons, state prisons. We should end all mandatory sentences. It makes no sense. And so there’s a lot of things we can do and we can do it now. But I know you know this because I know your activity. I know your interest. And keep it going. Keep it going because I’d tell you. No, I really mean it. You can change things. You can genuinely change things.(50:38)
The truth is we can’t afford to wait. The country needs solutions now and the problems exist now. I urge the Congress to take these actions immediately and urge young guys like you get involved and start at a state level the same thing. It’s the same thing. There’s so much more to say, but I’ve already said too much. And can I ask you a question? (50:59)
What you most get asked about in the community now? I met you down at East Side at Bethel with Reverend Beaman. I’ve seen you before. You know, it’s one of my old haunts but when you’re together with people your age in a neighborhood, what are they talking about now? I mean, for real, practically, not generically, just what concerns the most? (52:15)
Did you [crosstalk 00:52:16] see what happens when the system breaks down? (52:18)
This guy deliberately broke the system. He thinks government is bad Trump. The reason that doesn’t work, he thinks it isn’t designed to work. He doesn’t know how to make it work. It’s all about breaking it down. And it started with the Reagan era. Government is bad. Your problem is government. Well, let me tell you. Wealthy people don’t need government to protect them, but poor folks, white, black, all colors, all backgrounds, they need the government to protect them, otherwise they get taken advantage of. It’s just about power. The ultimate sin, my daddy say, the greatest sin of all is the abuse of power, abuse of power, whether it’s economic power, political power, or physical power, it’s the abuse of power. And that’s why we need young men like you and young women on this call to be engaged in the politics of changing what’s happening in the street.(53:14)
It really does matter. Now look, I don’t want them to paint this all rosey. Let me conclude by saying, look, the act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason for the protest. The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason for the protest in the first place. And what I worry about tomorrow night in Wilmington, for example, there was a lot of really good people. I’m not going to be here. I’m going to be up in Pennsylvania, but tomorrow night, and what I worry a little bit about, is you and many other are going to be out there protesting legitimately for change. But we can’t allow the protesting to overshadow the purpose of the protest. So there’s going to be a lot of folks who are going to want to cause trouble, some cops, but some folks too.(54:13)
And so it’s going to take young leaders like you to begin to change things in the city again and get reengaged in the city. An awful lot of people, Don, did very well. The guys I grew up with, everyone from Lafayette, Jackson, Spencer, Henry, all these guys who I grew up with, where it became very successful what they did. But what’s happened is that the last two mayors ago, African American mayors we’ve had, have called me and said, “Joe, whenever there was a problem before, every major successful African American businessman would be in my office, see what can do to help.”(54:55)
Problem is you tell them they’re not in the office anymore, a lot of them. (55:01)
They’re not being brought back in because they’ve said, “I’ve got other things they got to do.” But now you have young leaders like our current, like you and others that I met with, including dealing with not just the NAACP, with guys like been around a while like mouse, but also dealing with the new guys that are coming up and dealing with new organizations. And I feel something’s changing here. It’s starting to move again. (55:34)
And I think you’re going to be part of that. (55:59)
As a friend of mine used to say, from your lips to God’s ears. (57:03)
Well, Don, I do a lot of these meetings like this, and with your permission, I’ll contact you and see if we can get you to do more of this. But we have these, we call them round table discussions, from everything from first responders to women in the community, to dealing with whatever the issues are, to have them tell me what their problems are. And sometimes with good reason, they’re angry. They don’t think that I’ve proposed enough to get things done and they may be right. But what I found is I learn from them. What I find is that there is an emerging new sense of the need to be engaged, to be involved, just to make things just a little bit better, and we can make it a lot better.(57:56)
Because I really do think, Don, I’ll conclude by saying when I was coming up as a kid, I’m not making myself onto any great civil rights guy or big hero, but we’d desegregate movie theaters. And anyway, no, I was no big player. But I remember at a time in the early, when Bull Connor down in Birmingham, and you know a lot about this because you helped my buddy ion Alabama win, American people heard about how African Americans were treated and lynchings and all the things that were talked about back then, but people who lived in communities where there weren’t any African Americans, they just didn’t really believe that stuff happened. I mean, they thought it, but they didn’t see it.(58:49)
And Bull Connor thought he was going to stake a wooden stake in the heart of the civil rights movement when he sigged those dogs on those African American women in their Sunday best going to church, ripping skin off them with the fire hoses, having dogs to go after the kids and the like. And what happened then? As Dr. King said, paraphrasing, it awakened the nation like, Oh my God, this really happens? This really happens? We ended up with the Civil Rights Act. We ended up with the Voting Rights Act. It was a change because people around the country aren’t bad people, but they’re not engaged said, “I didn’t, you know, I understand that.”(59:29)
But when they saw it, it radicalized them into saying we got to act and it worked. I think that what Donald Trump has done and what was happened in a eight minute, and I think it’s 47 seconds, with a white cops knee on the neck of a guy smashed against the curb. I think it’s like, “Oh my God. Oh my God.” We see it in direct color. It’s technicolor. They’re looking at it, said, “Oh my God, I can’t breathe.” And the country now is having trouble breathing. They’re angry. And I think they’re ready to move. And we have to change the institutional structures, everything from police brutality, racism writ large, but also the things that make life better for people, access to healthcare, everybody, access to daycare, access to education, access, access, access to begin to rebuild a community and give people a shot.(01:00:43)
Anyway, I’m sorry, but I feel pretty passionate about it. And again, if I have the passion, I can only imagine how you feel. I can only imagine how you feel. (01:01:33)
You may remember. When they asked me to campaign down in Alabama. They said, “What’s we want Biden in Alabama for?” Okay? Well guess what? We’re going to win back the United States Senate. We have to win the United States Senate back. (01:01:49)
Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, places we hadn’t been able to compete before. We’re going to win back to the United States Senate. That’s going to change the ability of the next president to be able to make real change. (01:02:10)
Yeah. Well thank you very much. And we’ll do this again, team. I promise you. (01:02:18)
Guaranteed. (01:02:20)
Thank you. (01:02:29)
Social distance and wear your masks."
election_interview60_biden.txt,"(00:54)
Sure. I’m one of those folks or competitors, it’s not over till the bell rings. And I feel superstitious when I predict anything other than it’s going to be a hard fight. We feel good about where we are, but I don’t underestimate how he plays. (01:15)
Well, there’s an awful lot of talk out there about that trying to sort of de legitimize the election, all I think designed to make people wonder whether or not they should, whether it’s worth going to vote, just the intimidation factor. But what really has pleased me is the overwhelming turnout in the states that have early voted. (01:43)
Well, I hope there’s going to be a lot of people who vote for me because of who I am, but I think the contrast between Donald Trump and me is about as stark as it can get in terms of our value set and how we view the world. (02:02)
Well, for example, I think we have to fundamentally change the way in which we deal with institutional racism. For example, one of the hardest things is beyond police issues. There’s the issue of accumulation of wealth. There’s an awful lot of black Americans who are equally as qualified as white Americans based on the same status they are in, in terms of their economic opportunity, but they don’t get a chance. So for example, if we just made every corporation pay a minimum 15% tax, you got 91 pay no tax, that raises over $400 billion. I can send every single qualified person to a four year college in their state for 150 billion. I can make sure every single person who qualifies for community college can go, and we still have a lot of money left over. That’s what I mean by significant institutional changes. (03:25)
He’d loved to run against them, wouldn’t he? Mr. President, you’re running against Joe Biden. Joe Biden has a deep, steep, and successful record over a long, long time. (06:30)
Right now, the biggest domestic issue is our health. Right now, COVID. COVID, the way he’s handling COVID is just absolutely totally irresponsible. He’s telling people that we’ve turned the bend in one of his recent rallies. Well, he’s gone, and as my grandpop would say, he’s gone round the bend. I mean, we are in real trouble. (07:05)
We should be investing a great deal more money in testing and tracing. A woman can go in to a drug store and buy a pregnancy test and find out at home whether or not she’s pregnant. We should be doing the same kind of investment to see whether we’re going to have testing kits for people to know. It’s not enough to know in seven days or five days or three days whether or not you have COVID. (07:29)
That’s my point, but it’s not there. But they haven’t done it. They haven’t done it. (07:50)
Nobody thinks he makes any sense, nobody. No serious doc around the world. (07:58)
You’d don’t have to lock down the economy. It depends on the community. It depends on where it’s in real trouble. And you have to do things that make sense that make it easier for people to avoid being exposed. Freedom is about making sure that you care about the people you’re around that they be free too. It’s a patriotism to put this mask on. (08:33)
By writing the tax code. You got billionaires in this country making $700 billion during this crisis, $700 billion. (09:03)
Nobody making less than $400,000 will pay a penny more in tax under my proposal. (09:10)
That’s a guarantee, a promise. I give you my word as a Biden. That’s an absolute guarantee. (09:19)
Depending who you’re raising them on. Look, if you’re raising them on somebody who’s making a billion dollars a year, it’s not a problem that they pay 39.6%, which everybody should pay, raise another $90 billion. (09:33)
He’s sending them overseas already. Take a look at what’s happened. We have an [inaudible 00:09:36]. Trade deficit that’s larger with China than when we were there. (09:51)
We are making sure- (10:05)
Our lack of standing in the world. Look what he does. He embraces every dictator in sight and he pokes his finger in the eye of all of our friends. And so what’s happening now is you have the situation in Korea where they had more lethal missiles and they had more capacity than they had before. (10:24)
North Korea. You have a situation in the gulf where you have Iran closer to having enough fissile material to get a nuclear weapon than they had before. You have our NATO allies backing away from us because they say we can’t count on us. So he’s moving away from what has allowed us to bring the world together. (10:47)
Well, I think the biggest threat to America right now in terms of breaking up our security and our alliances is Russia. Secondly, I think that the biggest competitor is China. And depending on how we handle that will determine whether we’re competitors or we end up being in a more serious competition in relating to force. (11:43)
If elected, what I will do is I’ll put together a national bi-partisan commission of scholars, constitutional scholars, Democrats, Republicans, Liberal, Conservative. And I will ask them to over 180 days, come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the court system because it’s getting out of whack the way in which this is being handled. And it’s not about court packing, there’s a number of other things that our Constitutional scholars have debated and I’d look to see what recommendations that commission might make. (12:19)
Oh, it is a live ball. No, it is a live ball. We’re going to have to do that. And you’re going to find there’s a lot of Conservative Constitutional scholars [inaudible 00:12:26]. As well. The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football. Whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want. Presidents come and go. Supreme Court Justices stay for generations. I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. (13:22)
From what I’ve read and know, the intelligence community warned the president that Giuliani was being fed this information from the Russians. And we also know that Putin is trying very hard to spread disinformation about Joe Biden. And so when you put the combination of Russia, Giuliani, the president together, it’s just what it is. It’s a smear campaign because he has nothing he wants to talk about. What is he running on? What is he running on? (14:54)
Hey, the same guy who thought that the 9/11 attack was a 7/11 attack, he’s talking about dementia. All I can say to the American people is watch me. You see what I’ve done, you see what I’m going to do. Look at me, compare our physical and mental acuity. I’m happy to have that comparison. (15:24)
Number one, her values. Number two, she is smart as a devil, and number three, she has a backbone like a ramrod. Number four, she is really principled. And number five, she has had significant experience in the largest state in the Union in running the justice department that’s only second in size to the United States Justice Department. And obviously, I hope that never becomes a question. (16:49)
Your next vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris. (18:38)
Well, let me put it this way. Number one, I’ve never, ever supported defunding police. Matter of fact, we should give more funding to police for different reasons. Number two, any use of violence, burning down stores, smashing windows, that is a crime. People should be arrested, no justification for it. There’s never been a conflict with me between law and order and dignity. They’re one in the same. (19:09)
He wouldn’t know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn. Go out in the suburbs now. It’s not 1950. There are black and white families living next door to one another and driving each other’s kids to soccer practice. This is a different world than he lives in. Look, there’s a lot of reasons people are upset, a lot of good reasons. All he wants to do is take that sort of subliminal fear out there and say it’s because of that guy or because of that woman. That’s not who we are as a country. I mean, this is not who we are. It’s not our value system. We hold these truths to be self-evident. We’ve never met it. We’ve never met the standard, but we’ve always gone further and further and further toward inclusion. It’s the first president who’s trying to shut it down. We cannot sustain this democracy that way. We’re so much better than this."
biden-interview-24.txt,"Joe Biden, It's great to be with you. Thank you.
 Joe Biden, You guys I know wouldn't be easy. I'd rather be on FOX. They'd make it easier for me.
 Joe Biden, I know. No, I'm happy to be here. Thanks for having me.
 Joe Biden, It's a specific decision. And I just think it's crass. I mean, I've never thought it was a.... Look,
 I'm running against Donald Trump, not his children. And the American people want to hear about their
 families. Not about Trump's family or my family, although I'm very proud of my family. But I just think
 it's, it's just not how I was raised. It's that basic. It's Donald Trump.
 Joe Biden, It's the number one issue facing humanity. And it's the number one issue for me. And all the
 way back in the '80s, I'm the first person ever, ever to lay out the need for a deal with global warming.
 And PolitiFact said, ""Check it out, it was a game changer."" And but it's just the way in which this
 campaign had been run from the beginning about me, in the primaries, that it just never got traction.
 Look, climate change is the existential threat to humanity, the existential threat to humanity.
 Unchecked, it is going to actually bake this planet. This is not hyperbole. It's real. And we have a moral
 obligation. There's not many things. Dan and I worked together a long time. Don't hear me often invoke
 a moral obligation. We have a moral obligation, not just the young people. We have a moral obligation
 to everyone.
 Look what's happening right now. You just look around the United States of America. Forests are
 burning at a rate larger than Connecticut and Rhode Island combined -- being lost. People are losing
 their homes, their lives. In the middle of the country we're in a situation where you have 100-year floods
 occurring every several years, wiping out entire counties and doing great damage. And by the way, as
 Dan you may remember, the first thing that Barack and I were told about when we took when we went
 over to, when we were taken over to the Defense Department, they said the greatest threat facing, the
 greatest security threat America faces is climate change, because of what's going to happen. You'll see
 massive movements of populations fighting over land, fighting over the ability to live. And it is an
 existential threat.
 And so I just think, but also presents an enormous opportunity. It's a bizarre -- you know, we're one of
 the few countries in the world that's always been able to take things that are serious problems and turn
 them in opportunities. It's also the vehicle by which we can not only save the planet, but we can
 generate such economic growth and lead the world. But we have two problems. One, we have an
 internal problem in the United States. What are we going to do? We make up, we make up 15 percent of
 the problem. But we're in a position where the rest of the eighty-five percent of the world's responsible
 for the rest. We can go we can go net neutral in terms of carbon tomorrow. And we're still going to have
 our shores flooded. We're still going to have these terrific hurricanes. The polar caps are going to
 continue to melt. We're gonna have, we're gonna have hurricanes and storms, and they're going to
 increase. And so we have to do two things. We need a president who can lead the world. That's why I
 was so deeply involved in setting up the existence of the Paris Climate Accord, as well as do the things
 we have to do and can do. And the last point I'll make and I'll add any detail you'd like me to. But the last
 point I'd make is that, you know, the way we have to do this is we, you know, we cannot discount the
 concerns of people, what it means for their well-being and not only in the future and now, but what
 about how they make a living? That's why I'm the first person I'm aware of that went to every major
 labor union in the country and got them to sign on to my climate change plan, which is extensive. We're
 going to get to zero net emissions for the production of electricity by 2035. It's going to create millions
 of jobs. But we've got to let people -- we can't be cavalier about the impact it's going to have on how
 we're going to transition to do all this. But I just think it's a gigantic opportunity, a gigantic opportunity
 to create really good jobs.
 Joe Biden, I'm going to put pressure on them. I'm going to put pressure on them to live up what, this
 cause they talk about. And it starts off with voting. It starts off with volunteering. It starts off with 
 making sure that they're organizing and they're taking care to make sure the people on the the fenceline
 communities get taken care of. Make sure the priorities are set so we are in a situation where people
 who are hurt the most get help the quickest. You know, this is you know, I understand the sense. But the
 fact is that, look, the first thing we're going to do is make sure that we use the ability we have now, and I
 will as president, to do away with 100 changes in an executive order as he is, he's put forward to do
 everything from allow more methane to seep into the atmosphere, allow to pollute rivers, a whole
 range of things. We can do that very, very quickly.
 But it's also going to require us to make sure that we deal what with what we have to do now. For
 example, we should you know, as you guys know, because you both worked in administrations, that the
 president of states has control over a six hundred billion dollars in assigning federal contracts.
 Everything from one of the largest auto fleets and trucking fleets in the world to infrastructure. When,
 as Dan will remember, when the president asked me to handle to make sure we got the Recovery Act,
 an eight hundred billion dollars was going to be distributed to keep us from going into a depression, he
 gave me the authority to run that from beginning to end. And what we did was we were able to invest in
 bringing down the cost of renewable energy to compete with coal, gas, and oil. And so now you see
 what's happening. It's becoming a fait accompli. No one is going to build another oil or gas-fired electric
 plant. They're going to build one that is fired by renewable energy. We have to invest billions of dollars
 in making sure that we're able to transmit over our lines. You may remember, Dan, when we sat in that
 of those office buildings in between the interregnum period there, and we thought we could just make
 sure we could transfer this renewable energy across the country. Remember, we had that big map up
 and we showed all the high tension wires were going to go?
 Joe Biden, Exactly right. But what happened? What happened was ""not in my neighborhood."" People
 didn't want to have the high tension wires in their neighborhood. So what we're going to do, and what's
 happening now and we've been working on this for three years, you have a lot of folks in Silicon Valley
 and other places doing research on battery technology. So now we're going to be able to store, for
 example, they can have a battery about as wide as the width of my arms and about this thick that if you
 have solar power in your home and the sun doesn't shine for a week, that battery will store it. You're
 gonna be able to have all the energy you need in the meantime. We're going to provide five hundred
 and fifty thousand charging stations. For real. On the new infrastructure, green infrastructure we're
 going to be building. We're going to own the electric automobile market. We're going to create a million
 jobs in doing that. This is not hyperbole. These are things that have been run through by economists and
 Wall Street and -- and also by people who are in the thought community, the people who are running
 these major institutions. And so there's so much we can do and we could create a clean environment.
 We can also grow the economy and get people good wages. The fastest growing industries are solar and
 wind, solar and wind. And they're not paying 15 bucks an hour. They're paying prevailing wage -- every
 single contract the president gave me the authority to let when we were running the Recovery Act,
 every single one paid prevailing wage. That's 45 to 50 bucks an hour plus benefits. So that's how we're
 going to grow this economy.
 Joe Biden, I'd be happy to hear it.
 Joe Biden, Get control of the virus. Get control of Coronavirus. Without that, nothing else is going to
 work very well, number one. Number two, invest in the community, in real infrastructure. He's been
 promising to invest in infrastructure in '17, '18, '19, '20. He hasn't done a single, solitary thing. So we're
 going to invest in generating economic growth in the United States by making it and buying it. Buy it in
 America, made in America. He is exporting jobs overseas. The first thing we're going to have to do is to,
 in order to compete internationally, is we're going to have to compete. We used to have, we used to
 invest a little over two point six percent of our GDP in in research and science. It's now down to point six
 percent. We're going to invest in science and technology. We're going to make sure that we can
 compete with the rest of the world and lead the rest of the world. We have the greatest institutes. We
 have more great research universities in the United States of America than every other research
 university in the entire rest of the world combined. And the good news is, the people own them. They
 are not private institutions. Los Alamos is owned by a university. It is a university. The people own these
 systems and we so underestimate. That's where every major breakthrough has come out in the last
 twenty five years. And we're going to invest in those. We're going to continue to invest in the research
 and development. And it's going to go from making sure we have access to know how we're going to
 generate economic growth through infrastructure that is green as well as we're going to invest five
 billion dollars a year in cancer research.
 We're going to cure cancer. Mark my words. We're in a situation where, as you know, I ran the
 moonshot for the president. And what happened was we found significant breakthroughs. Everybody in
 the past walked by the mirror and looked in the mirror and saw a Nobel Prize about to be won. Great
 scientist, but they didn't share much information. They've virtually didn't share any information. Well,
 that's all changing now, it's changing drastically. And we're going to have to invest in dealing with the
 things that affect the mental, physical and and environmental health of the country. And we can do that.
 For example, if we don't do something about dealing with with Alzheimer's, every single bed, hospital
 bed in America within the next 20 years will be occupied by an Alzheimer's patient. And no insurance
 company is going to invest the kind of money needed to deal with it. We can't do that. We can do the
 same thing with other diseases like diabetes. We can do it with regard to a whole range of issues.
 So it's not just making sure we deal with the physical environment, which is critical and invest in new
 technologies. For example, one of the things I laid out, and I know as boring as hell but it's
 consequential. I laid out a farm policy farm F-A-R-M that allows us to drastically increase the amount of
 acreage able to set aside. So we pay farmers for putting their land in a land bank and planning deep
 rooted plants. You say, what's that about? It's about carbon capture. Put this in perspective. Right now,
 they're burning the Amazon. The Amazon absorbs more carbon from the air into the ground and the
 roots of trees and vegetation than is put into the air by the entire United States of America every single
 day. And what are we doing? We're letting it burn. We're not doing much at all. Organizing the rest of
 the world would go to the Brazilians and say, we're going to pay you collectively the following multibillion dollars to go into a different direction. If you don't, you're going to pay an economic price for 
 doing it. Well, right now, we can have the first net zero industry in America, carbon emissions, can be
 agriculture. I know this is boring stuff, but you think about what it can do. Look, all of the methane that
 is going into the air because of cow manure and because of pig manure and because of chickens, you
 know, we have a four billion dollar industry on the east coast of the state of Delaware. I mean, east
 coast of United States and the Delmarva Peninsula. Well, guess what? The chicken manure has been
 polluting the estuaries in the Chesapeake Bay. We know now how to take the methane out of the
 manure, turn it into pellets and make it reusable fertilizer and take the methane and stored in other
 ways. And it creates jobs in the process of doing it. But when you try to talk about things, other than the
 kids who are really deeply into the environmental stuff, it kind of glazes over.
 So there's so many things we could do in the process. We can generate, we can generate economic
 growth in rural America, let alone what we're gonna be able to do relative to the other changes we can
 make with regard to the environment, for example. Well, I won't go on.... I'm sorry, but I get a little
 excited about it because it's such an opportunity. And by the way, that's why we have to, the first thing
 I'm going to do is rejoin the Paris climate accord, because without us, nobody runs it. Nobody steps up.
 No one has the moral authority to do it. And I'll conclude by saying the thing that bothers me most
 about Donald Trump, is he has so fundamentally damaged the moral authority we have. We are the
 most powerful military in the history of the world. We not only lead by the example of our power, but
 with the power of our example. And our example we're setting around the world is devastatingly
 negative to our own security interest and the world's overall interests.... I apologize
 Joe Biden, Well, first of all, you know, what really rankles my opponent is I say that the thing that
 bothers them most is he's not a patch on Barack's jeans. I mean, Barack is one hell of a president. And I
 tell you what, man, what an honor it was, I think you guys believe it, too, to serve with him. An
 incredible honor. And I'm not being solicitous. I really mean that. He had more integrity in his little
 finger, than most people have in their whole body. And he had a backbone, like a ramrod, has one. But
 one of the things that I think is most important is those who haven't voted yet. First of all, go to
 iwillvote.com to make a plan. Exactly how you're going to vote, where you're going to vote, when you're
 going to vote. Because it can get complicated. Because the Republicans are doing everything they can to
 make it harder for people to vote. Particularly people of color to vote. So go to iwillvote.com. Secondly,
 we're in a situation where we have put together, and you guys did it for President Obama's
 administration before this, we have put together, I think, the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud
 organization in the history of American politics. What the president is trying to do is discourage people
 from voting by implying that their vote won't be counted. It can't be counted. We're going to challenge
 it and all these things. If enough people vote, it's going to overwhelm the system. You see what's
 happening now. You guys know it as well as I do. You see the long, long lines in early voting. You see the 
 millions of people have already cast a ballot. And so, don't be intimidated. If, in fact, you have any
 problem, go to and I don't have the number, but it's 833-DEM-VOTE. The letters D-E-M-V-O-T-E. Call that
 number. We have over a thousand lawyers, over a thousand of them answering the phone. If you think
 there's any challenge to your voting, go to 833-DEM-VOTE. Dial those letters on your phone that will get
 you the assistance that we have already put in place.
 Thirdly, for those who've already voted, it's not enough, God love ya, it's not enough that you voted. You
 got to go out and get your friends. You've got to go out and get your family. You've got to go out and get
 people. There's so many people like the old days when we used to be it used to be a lot easier. There's
 so many people when you get over that, were you able to knock on doors and know Mrs. Smith didn't
 have a vehicle that you drive her to the polls. You make sure that you get your friends, your family,
 because, look, you know, as John Lewis said before he passed away, you have a sacred right and it's a
 sacred obligation to vote, particularly young people. You're the one who, if eighteen to twenty five years
 old voted in the same percentage that the rest of the population voted in, in 2016, we know what
 happened. We would have had 5.2 million more people voting. You can own the election. You can own
 the outcome. It really, really, really, really, really matters.
 And make the case to your friends, make your case to your friends that they can't complain if they don't
 vote. And it's going to be counted. It's going to be counted. And because I think the American people are
 going to show up, Dan, in such large numbers, there's going to be no way to avoid the outcome. And
 look what he's done from the beginning. Done everything to try to discourage you, saying he's not sure
 he'll accept the results. He's not sure what he'll do. I guarantee you, he'll accept the results and he'll be
 out in.... There's no one going to stick with him, you know? You know, he's the only president I know
 that six of his generals who worked directly for him said he's unfit to be president and commander in
 chief. So I'm not worried about any any coup here. You know, I'm not really saying there's going to be a
 coup, but let's think about everything's been said. When I said about three months ago, I think he's
 going to he's going to suggest he may not step down. He may not accept the outcome of the vote.
 People said ""Oh, there goes Biden."" What did he do? Two weeks later?
 It's all designed to try to keep people from voting. So those who have voted, you know how long it took
 you, how you did it, what you did. Go to, particularly if you have, you know, grandparents or older folks
 in your neighborhood who you know, and they have they have an absentee ballot. Show them it matters
 how they fill it out. It's complicated, some of it. They haven't made it easier for people in many states.
 And by the way, that's why we challenged, it may not hold up in Pennsylvania if the Supreme Court were
 to change it, but now they've allowed the county that it's postmarked, it can be counted for all the way
 for the next several days, which it should be. Well, you have in Texas the governor having these drop
 boxes, one in a county. Some of the counties are as big as my state almost, literally. And the idea there's
 one drop box? And so we're going to be we're going to have enough people out there policing it,
 watching it, making sure. Do not be intimidated. But go out and help those who you know are going to
 have physical difficulty getting to a polling place or may need help on how to get done, what they need
 to get done to vote. iwillvote.com will tell you exactly where you can vote, where you live, what
 circumstances are available to you, and vote early. Vote early.
 By the way, I particularly at one of the things we did, you know, you guys generation has stepped up.
 One of the things you may recall that I started arguing for is the need for significantly more young poll
 workers. Well, thousands of you have showed up. Thousands of you have showed up. Because of COVID,
 older people who traditionally are the poll watchers and make sure everything's quite squared away,
 worried about it. They see what's happened to their friends. And so what's happening is this election is a
 generational election. This is this generation's opportunity, not a joke, to take back our democracy. It
 literally, literally my word as a Biden is at stake. Our democracy is at stake. And, you know, I have to
 admit to you, you know, I heard that. I was a history and political science major in college. I've been
 involved in public life my whole adult life. But I never really believed it, that it was really, you know,
 every generation has to earn it. Well, guess what? It's in jeopardy, man. It's in jeopardy. Do not be
 intimidated. Do not be intimidated. And whether you vote for me or against me. Vote. Vote. Vote.
 There's not a single thing we can't do when the American people stand together, and that's not
 hyperbole. I mean it. There's nothing, nothing beyond our capability.
 Joe Biden, I'm going to give it hell. Thank you very much. By the way, you guys have such an enormous
 following, not only with my children, my grown children, but my five grandchildren who range in age
 from 27 to 14. Oh no, that's not true, 16, she'd be very upset. I said 14. But all kidding aside, you really,
 you're really reaching out. And it touched me. Because you talk you know, you talk plainly to people and
 it matters. It really matters. Anyway, thanks. Looking forward to seeing you guys in person.
 Joe Biden, Thank you very much."
biden_first_speech.txt,"Folks, the people of this nation have spoken, they've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we the people. We've won with the most votes ever cast in a presidential ticket in the history of the nation. 74 million.
 Tonight, we're seeing all over this nation all cities in all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy of hope renewed faith in tomorrow [to] bring a better day. I'm humbled by the trust and confidence, you've placed in me. I pledged to be a president who seeks not to divide but unify. Who doesn't see red states and blue states, only sees the United States.
 I worked with all my heart with the confidence of the whole people to win the confidence of all of you. And that is what America is all about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again.
 Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband, and I would not be here without the love and tireless support of Jill, and my son Hunter, and Ashley my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and our spouses and all our family. They're my heart. Jill's a mom, a military mom, an educator. She has dedicated her life to education.
 But teaching isn't just what she does. It's who she is. For American educators, it's a great day for you all. You're gonna have one of your own in the White House. And Jill's gonna make a great first lady, I'm so proud of her.
 I'll have the honor to serve with a fantastic vice president. Kamala Harris will make history as the first woman, first black woman, the first woman of South Asian descent, the first daughter of immigrants ever elected in this country. Don't tell me it's not possible in the United States, it's long overdue. And we're reminded tonight, of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America has bent the arc of the moral universe more toward justice.
 Kamala, Doug, like it or not, your family, you become an honorary Bidens, there's no way out. All those of you who volunteered and worked the polls in the middle of this pandemic, local elected officials, you deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And to my campaign team and all the volunteers, all who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible, I owe you, I owe you everything.
 All those who supported us. I'm proud of the campaign we built and ran. I'm proud of the coalition we put together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, progressives, moderates, conservatives, young, urban, suburban, rural, gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. I mean it, especially those moments, especially those moments when this campaign was as low as damn, the African American community stood up again. You've always had my back and I'll have yours.
 I said at the outset. I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now I want the administration I look like and act like all of you.
 To those who voted for President Trump. I understand the disappointment. But now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again, and to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies.
 They are not our enemies, they're Americans. They're Americans. The bible tells us for everything there's a season. A time to build, time to reap, a time to sow and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America.
 Now this campaign is over. What is the will of the people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this: America is called upon us to marshal the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to marshal the forces of science, and the forces of hope in the great battles.
 The battle to control the virus. The battle of built prosperity. The battle to secure your family's health care. The battle of achieve racial justice, and to root out systemic racism in this country. The battle to save our planet by getting climate under control. The battle to restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That's all they're asking for, a fair shot.
 Folks, our work begins with getting COVID under control. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduations. All the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help pave the Biden Harris covered plan and convert it into an action blueprint that will start on January 20th, 2021. That plan will rebuild on bedrock science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic.
 Folks, I'm a proud Democrat. But I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not some mysterious force beyond our control, it's a decision, a choice we make. And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us and the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interest. That's a choice I'll make. And I'll call on Congress, Democrats, Republicans alike to make that choice with me.
 The American story. It's about slow yet steadily widening the opportunities in America. And make no mistake. Too many dreams have been deferred for too long. We must make the promise of the country real for everybody, no matter their race, their ethnicity, their faith, their identity or their disability. Folks, America has always been shaped by inflection points, by moments in time when we've made hard decisions about who we are and what we want to be.
 Lincoln in 1860, coming to save the union, FDR in 1932, promising a beleaguered country, a new deal. JFK in 1960 pledging a new frontier. And 12 years ago, when Barack Obama made history, he told us, ""Yes we can.""
 We stand at an inflection point. We have an opportunity to defeat despair, to build a nation of prosperity and purpose. We can do it, I know we can. I've long talked about the battle for the soul of America. We must restore the soul of America. Our nation is shaped by the constant battle between our better angels, and our darkest impulses. It's time for our better angels to prevail. Tonight, the whole world is watching America. And I believe at our best, America is a beacon for the globe. We will lead not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.
 I've always believed we could define America in one word: possibilities. That in America everyone should be given an opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God given ability will take them. I believe in the possibilities of this country. We're always looking ahead. An American that creates jobs with dignity and respect, an America that cures diseases like cancer and Alzheimer. Ahead to an America that never leaves anyone behind. Ahead to an America that never gives up, never gives in.
 This is a great nation. It's always been a bad bet to bet against America. We're good people. This is the United States of America and there's never been anything we've been able to do when we've done it together.
 Folks, in the last days of the campaign, I began thinking about a hymn that means a lot to me and my family particularly my deceased son Beau. It captures the faith that sustains me, which I believe sustains America. And I hope it can provide some comfort and solace to the Americans who've lost a loved one through this terrible virus this year. My heart goes out to each and every one of you. Hopefully this then gives you solace as well.
 It goes like this: And he will raise you up on eagle's wings, bury you in the breath of a dog, and make you shine like the sun and hold you in the palm of his hand. And now together on eagle's wings, we embark on the work that God and his ship called upon us to do with full hearts and steady hands with faith in America and each other. With love of country, a thirst for justice. Let us be the nation that we know we can be, a nation united, a nation strengthened, a nation healed. The United States of America, ladies and gentlemen. There's never, never been anything we've dried up unable to do.
 So remember, as my Grandpa said, as I walked out of his home, when I was a kid up in Scranton, he said, ""Joey. Keep the faith."" And our grandmother when she was alive, she yelled, ""Joey, spread it! Spread the faith!""
 God loves you all. May God bless America and may God protect our church."
