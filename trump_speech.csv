Well, thank you very much. And I hope Dan is going to be okay. Dan is a great guy. Dan is a great guy. (00:32)
He’ll be tough. He’s so tough. He’ll beat it. (00:53)
Well, we feel very good. We have crowds that nobody’s ever had before, I can say that. I think you could agree. It’s been incredible. (01:01)
The crowds have been incredible, and nobody’s ever had it before. And so, I think that translates into a lot of votes, and we’re going to see very soon, but we’re getting very good response. We’re getting a very early response to see, and I think we’re doing incredible in Florida. I think we’re doing… And you were just talking about the vote, the African-American vote, et cetera. I think we’re doing really well with African-American vote. I think we’re doing very, very well with the Hispanic vote, and it’s a great run, but it’s been a great three weeks. Incredible three weeks. I think since the debate [crosstalk 00:01:39] the second debate was very good, and I was also interviewed by Savannah Guthrie. And that was, I think, very good. I mean, I wouldn’t say she was exactly nice to me, but a lot of people watched it. A lot of people. It was a special, or I guess they would call it a town hall. It didn’t feel like a town to me, but it was a very good debate or interview, I guess people say. (02:07)
But the second debate in particular, I think was something that worked out very well. And then we did the… We got back, we’re lucky we got it back, because for a period of time we did not think we were going to get these big rallies back. And we got them back and they were amazing. I mean, they were amazing. And you add it all together, and I think we really took off. (02:43)
Well, this has a special show for me. I’ve liked it from day one. We’ve had a great relationship, and then you have a great show. So it’s my honor. (03:43)
Well, it’s become pretty standard. We built the greatest Academy in the world. It was horribly interrupted by something that should’ve never happened. Came in from China, the plague, the plague from China, the horrible situation. And we had to shut it down and we had to learn about it. We had to shut it down and we did the right thing. We saved two million people. We saved a lot of people. The original model was 2.2 million people. And so if you use that model, and you go, that was a main model, you’ve used that model. We saved two million people, and now we’re building it back up again. And we had the best economy. Nobody had ever seen anything like it. And now what happens is we build it up again and we are doing it at a record clip. You saw the 33.1 on Thursday.(04:37)
That’s the biggest number we’ve ever had GDP. And we’re on a shape to build this up to a level that nobody’s ever seen anything like it. I really think that we’re going to end up with an economy that will be better than last year. Last year was at a record. Last year was the best economy we’ve had. So we have a chance to build something that will be fantastic. Now, in addition to that, we are doing very well. And I say rounding the corner. And some people don’t like that phrase, but I use that phrase. We’re coming out with vaccines, the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. We have many companies. We have the three main companies, but we have many companies coming out with them. They’re going to be activated very quickly, distributed and activated very quickly. And that will be that.(05:32)
We will tame originally, but ultimately get rid of the China plague. You see what’s happening in Europe. It’s a terrible thing. It’s a very terrible thing. This is a horrible disease. We have learned about it. It affects the elderly. I tell the story about Barron Trump. He had it for about two seconds. It just went through him and it’s gone. And the immune system on children, that’s why you’ve got to get the children back to work, children back to school. You have to get the people, they have to go to work. We have to open up our States and that’ll happen. I think now politically that will happen, because you have the date, and politically it will happen. I mean, today’s going to be a very interesting day. It will be a day that, I had this once before and it worked out very well. And this day is going to be something that’s going to be very important and very, very special, I think.6:34)
Well, Mr. President, you’ve got Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They’re crisscrossing Pennsylvania. They’re going back out there. I don’t know if that means they’re worried. I want to get your take on that. And also, what are your plans today? Because I know you said yesterday, you said, “We’ve got a lot of big surprises today.” What are those surprises?(06:50)
So I’m doing a big series of phone calls and to some really good people. And you’re the first one, by the way, but I’m doing a big series of calls. And in doing the calls, I’m going to be talking to some people that really, that have been very important. Both to me, important, some very important calls and some people that have been very loyal to me over the years. I like those people too. Even if they reach about 15 people, that’s okay with me. And I’m also going to [crosstalk 00:07:21]7:21)
You mean, media interviews?(07:21)
Probably go to Virginia. We have a headquarters over there in Virginia, just to say, thank you to all of the people. And that would be probably around 10:30 or so. I noticed that Biden went out and I think he’s campaigning a little, because he’s worried. We’ve seen tremendous swing changes. We’ve seen actually in the last three days, this reminds me, I hope it reminds me of four years ago. Tremendous changes have taken place over the last week. Tremendous. (07:49)
And what we think we’re winning Texas very big. We think we’re winning Florida very big. We think we’re winning Arizona very big. I think we’re going to do very well in North Carolina. I think we’re going to do very well in Pennsylvania. We think we’re doing very well everywhere. And it’s more than thinking. We’re seeing trends. (08:12)
And so you can tell this isn’t just taking a poll. This is based on trends. And we think we’re doing very well in States. A lot of States, really. A lot of States. (09:04)
Well, that was a weird quote, I agree with you. That was a very weird quote and I don’t know what she meant, except maybe she’s talking about the very strange decision made by the US Supreme Court that allows extra time and a lot of other things, frankly, but it allows extra time, and it allows for chaos, frankly. And so maybe she’s talking about that. Maybe you can blow out Pennsylvania, so you don’t have to [crosstalk 00:09:34]- (09:35)
… but I cannot imagine what that quote meant. That was a strange quote. (09:44)
No, I think I’ve gotten to a point we don’t get too intimidated. I have no idea who she is. She has something to do with this campaign, I guess. But no, it was a strange quote. It was not a smart quote either, I think (10:16)
When there’s victory, if there’s victory, I think we’ll have victory. I think the polls are suppression balls. And I think we’ll have victory, but only when there’s victory. I mean there’s no reason to play games. And I think we’ll have victory. I look at it as being a very, a very solid chance at winning. I don’t know what the chances are, I don’t know how they rate the chances, but I think we have a very solid chance of winning. And I think a lot of that has to do with the tremendous crowd size for a small event. There was no small event, every place, no matter where we went were- (10:58)
… the largest… Your friend Tucker did something on his last night, I don’t know if you got to see it, but he said he was looking at the internet or whatever, and he’s looking at these massive crowds like he’s never seen before, and in areas that were great areas, frankly, as far as I’m concerned, these are great people. These are like the heart and soul of our country.(11:21)
And so Tucker, he did a piece on it last night on these incredible crowds, these massive crowds. You know, it hasn’t taken place ever in history, in the history of our country, what we’ve done in terms of crowd size and every… I really did six yesterday because the one from the day before went till two in the morning. So then I got up and did one at eight. So if I include the one that lasted until two in the morning, that was six of them. And these aren’t like speeches, these are big, these are massive rallies.(12:01)
These are really big, where you have 30, 40,000. We had a 51,000 people, and they’re built in largely at airports, always open because of the corona, but they’re built in airports because we have the room. And sometimes the airport wasn’t big enough; it was crazy. And if that’s any indication- (12:26)
… because to me, that’s like the ultimate poll, that’s better than somebody that said he interviewed 213 people, and then they send you a check for a million dollars, right? We don’t do that. But I think it’s the ultimate poll. And it’s been, honestly it’s been so much fun to me. There’s so much love at those rallies, nobody’s seen anything like it. They even say many of them, “We love you, we love you, we love you.” They’re screaming, “We love you,” and I don’t think it’s ever happened before.(12:59)
You know, I’ve never heard- (13:01)
… that chant. People liked Ronald Reagan, but that never happened to him. And the media is looking for it to have happened, because they’d like to show that I wasn’t the first, but nobody’s ever seen that happen. There’s tremendous spirit.(13:15)
And there’s something else, they call them organic where they just spring up, thousands of cars that stretch for 98 miles, tractors, thousands of tractors and farms in Iowa- (13:28)
… different places. And you’ve seen the boats, the boats are 6,000 boats in a lake, and we’re all going for records. It’s been incredible, actually incredible. (14:08)
Well I was kidding actually, but there is a little emotion, but I’ve said that a few times, actually, I say, “Don’t make me cry, don’t make me cry. You’ll make me cry, and that will be very bad for my image as president,” and I kid, so I was actually kidding. I do do- (14:28)
… a lot of times I do that, and then I take my fingers and I put them under my eye, “Don’t make me cry.” But I do that kiddingly. But it is emotional, it’s incredible. It’s tremendous love. Nobody’s ever seen it before; I bet you’ve never heard of it before. And it happens [crosstalk 00:14:47] at every rally.4:49)
And when they say they love you, I like how you say, “Well, I love you too.” Because when you love someone, that’s always nice to hear back. But what has it been like? Have you loved the job? Has it been worth it because you’ve been under so much attack?(15:03)
Well, it’s been mean, it’s been… you’ve dealt with horrible people like Shifty Schiff, and Crazy Nancy, and [Prion 00:15:11] Chuck Schumer, you deal with some horrible people.(15:15)
People say, “Who is the hardest,” friends of mine from the past really, they say, “President,” because they all call me president, they used to call me, “Donald,” now they called me, “President,” which is terrible. It’s hard to have friends because they react differently to me now than they used to.(15:31)
You know, in the old days, “Hey, let’s go to dinner Don.” Now it’s, “Mr. President, gee, could we somehow get together someday?” And I’m sad, the changes it’s sort of [inaudible 00:15:43], but you three are friends. Okay, but it is a very different thing.(15:49)
But you deal with people that are very deceptive, but they’ll go, “Mr. President, tell me who’s the country that’s most difficult to deal with? Is it Russia? Is it China? Is it North Korea? Sir, is it North Korea?”(16:06)
And I go, “No. Well, by far the most difficult country to deal with is the US, it’s not even close.”(16:16)
And they all say, “You got to be kidding.”(16:18)
And I say, “No, I’m actually probably not kidding.” We have very, very deceptive people. We have some people that I think they’re sick in some ways, like an Adam Schiff, I think Adam Schiff is a sick person. And we deal with them, we just deal with them. But it’s a shame, it’s a shame.(16:39)
But the inner workings of the US… very, very difficult. Unless you want to sit there and do nothing, or unless you want to exceed to doing everything they want to do. And we don’t want to do that. (17:23)
Well, fortunately he’s drawing flies. He’s not getting anybody to go listen to him too much. Actually Fox puts him on more than anybody else, which is sort of shocking to me because Fox has changed a lot. And somebody said, “What’s the biggest difference between this and four years ago?”(17:40)
And I say, “Fox, it’s much different.” You still have great people, but you’re three of them- (17:51)
But Fox is a [crosstalk 00:17:51] much different place in terms of politics. Excuse me? (18:14)
Well in the old days, they wouldn’t put sleepy Joe Biden on every time he opened his mouth. They had other networks for that, frankly. And it’s a much different operation. I’m just telling you. It’s much different. And you have great people when you have Sean and you have Laura and you have yourselves, and you have some incredible people. I’m just saying Tucker has been great. I think you really have incredible people, but it’s much different. I could name some of your side players that you’ll interview. You had a period of time. I think you’re still doing it. But you had Democrats on more than you had Republicans. And look, it’s different. I’m not complaining. I’m just telling people it’s one of the biggest differences, this season compared to last. I think this season, we have much more despite that, and this is hard to believe.(19:07)
I think we’ve done actually much better. We obviously ran a good campaign. It was sort of a miracle campaign, but we have a record to go and we’ve done a lot. When you look at the tax cuts and you look at the regulation cuts, biggest in history. You look at all of the things that we’ve done. Space Force. We rebuilt the military. We rebuilt the entire military. It was a mess. And- (19:32)
We just got a 91% approval rating for the vets. The vets have been really treated badly for a long period of time. And we got accountability done for the vets, which nobody thought could be done. People treat them badly. They get fired. You couldn’t get people out. The vets lived in the hell. They just lived in hell and you couldn’t get them out. So I mean, well, we’ve done so many other things. The wall is going to be completed within a very short period of time. We’re over 410 miles. We’re doing 10 miles a week. And it’s really an incredible… It’s a system exactly like border patrol wanted. It’s been really amazing. And it’s had a big impact, as you see.(20:18)
I mean, you announced we have the best numbers that we’ve ever had on the Southern border. Like right to try. We did right to try. It’s not a smaller thing. It’s a big thing. They’ve been trying to do it for many years. So if you’re terminally ill and we have a great drug at the FDA but it’s not going to be approved for another two years, but you’re terminally ill, we now can get that drug and use it for somebody who’s terminally ill. We worked a system that works out great. You sign a document to take away liability from the companies and from the country itself. And people have right to try. Instead of going all over the world or going home and dying, they can do this. They’ve been trying to do that for 50 years. They were never able to get it worked out. We moved the embassy, and think of it, in Israel. Every president wanted to do that. (21:08)
Every president wanted to do that. (21:10)
Jerusalem becoming the capital, they all wanted to do it. But I understand why they didn’t because there was tremendous pressure once you got in not to do it from other countries, tremendous pressure like you haven’t seen before. But I did it. I got it done. But we’ve done more than… I have a list. You could read it for a day. So we’ve done a lot. Very proud of it. It’s great for the country. (22:45)
Well, I think it’s very disrespectful to Biden, actually. I think it’s a terribly disrespectful phone call to make. If you gave me that, I would have put it up on the board. We’ve been doing that half the last probably 15 rallies. I put up a board and we put up a lot of things. We put up how he said, “Fracking, fracking.” And then he said, “No fracking.” He came out and said, “There will be no fracking.” And then he went out and did the opposite once he reached Pennsylvania and learned it’s a million jobs and it’s tremendous money. And all of a sudden, he changes his mind. He was never hit by the press, was never asked about it. It’s ridiculous. But we put things like that up on the board. Had you had this, whatever it is, Zoom, I would’ve put that up on the board gladly.(23:33)
This shows tremendous disrespect for Biden. It shows exactly what I was saying that he’s not going to be running the group. And that group of people is probably close to impossible to run. I call it the AOC plus three. That’s a tough group to run. And they would take the country into a terrible place. But Joe’s going to have a hard time. He’s not going to be able to handle that. I mean, Joe is having a very hard time. Joe Biden is not prime time. And he never was actually. But he’s not prime time. And he’s put in a very hard position when you see all of the gaps and all of the problems. This is something that he shouldn’t be… When he says he’s a proud Democrat running for the US Senate.(24:27)
And at first I thought he was joking, but he wasn’t joking. He’s done that a number of times. He’s called his location where he was. He’s in Ohio, and he says, “I’m in Iowa.” It’s great to be with the people of Iowa. And they start screaming, “No, no you’re in Ohio.” And that’s happened many, many times. And that’s something you can’t let happen. That will be the end of the speech. There’s nothing you can do to recover. So, it’s a tough thing for him. Frankly, he should not be in this position. (26:16)
Well, I tell you, I think it’s very sad. And part of the reason is it’ll all be in Democrat cities, Democrat-run cities. It’s going to be in Chicago, New York and Portland and Oakland, different places, Baltimore. And that’s because of weak leadership. Weak, weak leadership. And my side is a very strong side if they wanted to, but they don’t like doing that. They’re proud of our country. They don’t want to hurt our country. But the other side is radicalized Antifa. And frankly, if you let people know that there would be hell to pay, you wouldn’t have any problem, but they don’t do that. They have the cops stand back, stand back-(27:03)
… do that. They have the cops stand back, stand back and watch looters walk washing machines and televisions out of stores. It’s a shame to watch it. I watched what happened in Philadelphia. (27:16)
I looked at that and you see the cops standby and you know they’re good cops. The Philadelphia cops are good cops. They don’t want to stand back, but they’re told to stand back. And these kids and wise guys and anarchists, agitators and looters and rioters, I mean, that’s what they are, that when they see weakness, they go for it. It’s a shame. No reason for it.(27:41)
When the statutes were being affected so badly, where they were knocking down statues, I took an old law… Basically, I modernized a very powerful old law, and you get 10 years in jail if you’re knock down a statute. And since that time, and now this is on a federal basis, cities could do the same thing. We could reinstitute it for cities if asked. But since that time, it just stopped. I mean, it just totally stopped, because people would say, “10 years is just too much.” They would be able to stop this so easily by being tough, frankly, by not allowing-rdt: (28:18)
Right. Well we hope it doesn’t happen.(28:19)
… thugs to run around and break windows.rdt: (28:21)
Mister-(28:21)
I think it’s very sad when stores are boarded up. I understand why they do it, because a piece of last is very expensive and plywood doesn’t cost much. They probably have it from years ago, from past problems. But it’s a very sad… To me, it’s a very sad thing.rdt: (28:37)
Mr. President. I want to bring something up and I believe this is going to be our last question. I don’t think we have… I think we’re being told this is the last question. (29:00)
Our country could never be the same country if they win because they’re radicalized left. Joe Biden will never call all the shots, and if he does, he’s not going to be there very long. He’s got a vice president who’s further left than Bernie Sanders, who is not a particularly good person. And she would be, I think, a terrible first representative… If she became the first woman president, I think it would be a terrible thing for our country. I think it would be a terrible thing for women. I look forward to the first woman president, but I don’t look… I wouldn’t look forward to her being that person. I think it would be a very bad thing. And I think you’d have a country that would become a socialist country.(29:51)
If they pack the court. So it will be a terrible thing, and a terrible thing. And yet, the Supreme Court has given us very bad decisions. Everyone says, “Oh, Trump has three people.” Now, Amy didn’t take part because she just got there. I understand that. But this decision on Pennsylvania was a horrible decision. There’s just no reason to go beyond a date. (30:15)
People should put their ballots in early. You don’t have to wait until the end. (30:19)
Why are they waiting till the end. Let the people… They have it for a long time. They put their ballots in early and there’s plenty of time to count it, tabulate it and do it through a normal course. If they come late or after the fact, and then they give them all this time, so we’re going to be waiting. And it’s really Pennsylvania. But you could say others may be included in that. We’ll have to find out. (30:43)
We’ll find out. (30:45)
But it’s a very dangerous thing to be waiting. (30:48)
And we’re waiting this tremendous… It’s not fair to the people of Pennsylvania, but it’s not fair to the people of this country. And I wouldn’t say they are outstanding representatives. If you look at Philadelphia, the amount of horror that’s gone on there during the elections, Philadelphia has been a disaster, as far as I’m concerned. Not everybody will say it. They don’t like saying it. Philadelphia will be a disaster. And it’s like, we’re putting these people on the honor system, but there’s no reason for doing this, and it actually delays the election.(31:21)
I’d like to find out on November 3rd, the end of the evening, or late into the morning, whenever, who won the election. And that doesn’t allow that to happen, unless there’s a blowout or unless you don’t need Pennsylvania. Now, it’s very unlikely. Pennsylvania is a very important state. I think we’re going to win Pennsylvania. We have very good numbers of Pennsylvania. Really good. (31:46)
But I think we’re going to win it. (31:50)
But I think it’d be nice to have… You want to have a win on November 3rd or the morning going along beyond 12 o’clock. (31:58)
It’s a terrible thing they’ve done. And it’s a very dangerous decision. They’ve been made. (32:23)
My number last time was 306. Remember they said… You and I had this conversation a long time ago, right? (32:30)
And you asked me this question, believe it. I don’t know. I think you remember that, but I ended up with 306. That was good numbers. 223 to 306. And that was a big number. And I think too, we will top it. I’ll leave it at that. I think we’ll top it. I think we’ll get better. (32:51)
People appreciate the job we’ve done. And if you look at the numbers and I see the futures were up. (32:56)
I’ll tell one thing, we have a headwind or the stock market, because on the chance that Biden got in, you will have a stock market go down like you wouldn’t believe, if he got in. And I see the markets projected to be up quite nicely today. And it was up yesterday very nicely, because people are starting to think that I’m going to win and the stock market will go… This a real headwind having this, because it’s always got, everybody has a chance, but now they’re looking at it, I think, differently than they were even four days ago.(33:29)
Now, we’ve made a lot of progress in the last four days. And I’ve also worked- (33:35)
… very hard. A lot of people said, “How do you do that?” I said, “I do it because I have to do it.” But it’s been an honor and has been such love. It has been, and it’s love on both sides. I mean, you have 30, 40,000 more people in this big area and you feel the love. It’s so incredible. And that’s what I’m telling you, tucker did an unbelievable piece. He got it. He figured it out, because it’s never happened before in the history of our country, never anything like this. When Biden goes and he has 20 or 30 people, that’s not so different from a lot of other people. If Ronald Reagan came in to do a rally, because he was a popular guy, if he had 200 or 300 people, that’s fine. That’s anticipated. Usually, they’d go to a ballroom and they’d have it in a ballroom. I’m coming in and we’re having 45,000 people. You had to see the rally we had the other night in Miami. Ended at 1:00 in the morning, but people didn’t leave. They didn’t want to leave. It’s been amazing. It’s truly been amazing. (34:56)
Right.rdt: (34:57)
Thank you.(34:57)
Thank you very much. Thank you."

You’re going to be fair. (00:04)
Just be fair. (00:13)
No, I’m not looking for that. I’m looking for fairness. That’s all. (00:13)
Yeah. (00:13)
No, I’m not. (00:19)
Well, I’m going to be fair. You don’t ask Biden tough questions. (00:22)
It’s terrible. It’s terrible. (00:28)
You know that. Okay. Are you ready? (00:53)
Because we’ve done a great job and it’s not finished yet, and when I finish, this country will be in a position like it hasn’t been maybe ever. The economy is already roaring back and other people aren’t going to bring it back. Certainly the person that we’re dealing with is not going to bring it back. They’re going to raise taxes. They’re going to take away your second amendment. They’re going to do things that nobody would even believe. It’s radical. There’s never been anything like it. No, we are- (01:21)
… positioned like never before. We’re going to have a fantastic year next year. (01:33)
Well, ultimately let me, and I’ll tell you, it was happening. We created the greatest economy in the history of our country and the other side was having- (01:42)
It is totally true. (01:44)
Best unemployment numbers, best employment numbers, 160 million people working, highest stock market price. You wouldn’t say that to Biden, what you just said to me. If he had it, you would never say that to Biden. We had the best stock market price ever, that we’re getting close to that price again. We had the best … Everything was the best. Our companies were doing better than they’ve ever done before. You cannot even think about talking about that. (02:13)
Well, you don’t have to fact check me. (02:15)
I mean, excuse me. The stock market was at its highest, the unemployment numbers for African-Americans, for Asian Americans, for Hispanic Americans, for everybody were the best. Virtually every number was the best. We had the best economy ever. And what was happening is things were coming together- (02:34)
Well, I’m going to say that. And the other side was starting to call, let’s get together. There was going to be unity. And then we got hit with the plague and we had to do it again. And we closed it up and I saved millions of lives. Millions of lives we saved. And now the economy’s growing again at record numbers. 11.4 million people employed in the last short period of time. (03:04)
The priority now is to get back to normal, get back to where we were, to have the economy rage and be great with jobs and everybody be happy. And that’s where we’re going and that’s where we’re heading. (03:20)
I would say China. They’re an adversary. They’re a competitor. They’re a foe in many ways, but they’re an adversary. I think what happened was disgraceful. It should never have happened. They should never have allowed this plague to get out of China and go throughout the world. 188 countries. It should never have happened. (03:47)
What’s wrong?3:49)
The flag is wobbling I think because it’s under those vents, perhaps behind you, Tom?3:53)
His hair’s coming down a little bit.(04:01)
It doesn’t look nice blowing in the wind? (04:04)
Let’s go. (04:31)
I don’t think so at all, no. I think we’ve done a great job with COVID, and we’ve hired- (04:39)
Excuse me. 11.4 million people. Why? Because the last report was just a little bit off? (04:41)
And this is without- (04:42)
Okay. You know why cases are up also? Because we do more testing. If we didn’t do testing, cases would be way down. (04:57)
No, what I’m saying to you, Lesley, is the following. We do more testing than any country in the world by far. Second is India with 1.5 billion people. We do more testing. If we did half the testing, we’d have half the cases. If we did no testing, like many countries, we would have very few cases. Because we do so much testing, the fake news media loves to say cases are up. The fact is we’ve done a very, very good job. (05:23)
We have done … That’s right because we’re doing so much testing. (05:30)
Yes, cases are up because we are doing tremendous testing and we’re finding where there’s a problem. Testing is a good thing, but it’s also very misleading. (05:43)
That’s right. We have turned the corner now. We have turned the corner. (05:53)
We have turned the corner. We understand the disease. We understand the elderly and we’re taking care of them at a level like nobody’s ever taken care of the elderly, especially the elderly with diabetes problems, heart problems. We are taking care of them like nobody’s ever taken care of them. We also understand youth, 99.9%. As an example, Barron had it and it was gone in no time. It was just like he had it, it was gone, hardly knew he even had it. So we are taking care of our people, but we’ve done a great job with the ventilators, with the equipment, with stocking governors that were not stocked. We made a lot of governors look very good that shouldn’t look good, and that’s okay with me. (06:42)
Yeah. (06:44)
Oh, I didn’t say that. You know, that’s so misleading, the way … I say jokingly suburban women, you should love me because I’m giving you security and I got rid of the worst regulation. See, the way you said that is why people think of you and everyone else as fake news. I said kiddingly, suburban women, you should love me. I got rid of a regulation that would bring low income housing into suburbia that would destroy suburbia. And I said that in a joking way. The way you have it, it’s like I’m begging. I’m kidding. Play it. And I’m kidding. That is such a misleading question, Lesley. (07:29)
I doubt it. I doubt it. I really doubt it. (07:31)
I’m saving suburbia. He’s going to destroy suburbia. He’s got a regulation, which I terminated, that he would put back and even worse that will destroy, that will bring low income housing projects into suburbia. And women understand that. And they’ve really learned about it over the last two, three weeks. I terminated the worst regulation you could possibly have. It’s gone, and suburban women appreciate it. They want security. They want safety. Look, I’ve been endorsed by almost every police department, almost every law enforcement group in the country. He’s been endorsed by almost nobody. Suburban women want security. (08:17)
You’re not looking at recent polls. (08:35)
We are rounding the corner. We are rounding the corner. (08:35)
We are rounding the corner. (08:35)
We’re rounding the corner. We’re doing well. We’re doing well. We understand the disease. I saved millions of people. 2.2 million people were supposed to die. You go back and you look at your models, 2.2 million people. We saved tremendous numbers of people. Plus I closed it very early from China, heavily infected, and even from Europe heavily infected, we’ve done a good job. We’ve done maybe a great job. What we haven’t done a good job on is convincing people like you because you’re really quite impossible to convince, but that’s okay. And the economy now is coming back and it’s coming back very strongly. And people see that, Lesley. (09:22)
Lesley, we just picked up 11.4 million jobs. It’s the largest number in the history of our country in a short period of time. (09:32)
Lesley, you didn’t hear me. We just picked up 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time. It’s the largest number in the history of our country. (09:45)
What I’m saying is we got hit by something, not my fault, not your fault. We got hit from something that came out of China. I got stuck with it. And let me tell you, before it happened, we were doing so good and now we’re going to be doing, and we are, we are doing good.(10:03)
And that we’re going to be doing, and we are, we are doing good. But look at, as an example, last week, a few days ago, Gallup did a poll. 56% of the people said that they’d better off now during a pandemic, then they were doing Obama and Biden, 56%. It was a record number, right? (10:30)
No, I don’t ignore it. (10:33)
What I’m saying is that we got hit with somebody, it’s not our fault. We got hit- (10:38)
… and we’ve done a good job, not a good job. We’ve done a great job. Remember that number, a very important number, 56% say they’re happier now than they were four years ago under Biden and Obama, right? I’ll put his name first, Biden and Obama. And they didn’t have a pandemic. Although, Biden did have a big problem with H1N1, which he says in reverse, with the H1N1, swine flu and it was a disaster. And his own chief of staff said it was a total disaster. They didn’t know what they were doing. (11:26)
Dr. Fauci, when did I call him an idiot? (11:33)
When did I call him an idiot? (11:35)
Well, he’s been wrong a lot. I like him, but he’s been wrong. (11:44)
Well, Dr. Fauci originally said, it’s a very complex subject. (11:49)
Let me just tell you, you mentioned … Dr. Fauci said, “Don’t wear masks.” Then he said, wear them. (11:54)
I say that … I feel masks possibly work, but certainly you want to stay away a certain distance, socially distance, et cetera. But I would say a mask works and I have nothing against masks. And I tell people to wear masks. I have no problem. (12:14)
A lot of people are wearing masks and they’re outside. (12:28)
Take a look. Yesterday, we were in Arizona, record setting rallies, numbers of people like nobody’s seen before. Many, many masks, I watched. (12:36)
What, what? (12:41)
No, these are much bigger than I ever had. (12:43)
You’re so negative, you’re so negative. These are the biggest rallies we’ve ever had. You just come in here with a negative attitude. These are the biggest rallies we’ve ever had. We’re having numbers like we’ve never had. (12:56)
There is a more … excuse me, no, but you made a statement. There’s more enthusiasm right now for us than we ever had before, ever. And you will see that in a short period of time. (13:10)
A lot of people are wearing masks. I mean, I looked yesterday, a lot of people were and it’s outdoor. They want it outdoor and we’re doing it outdoors. (13:30)
I tell people to wear masks. (13:32)
Lesley, we hand out thousands of masks. (13:41)
Well, have you been looking yesterday, take a look yesterday in Arizona, everybody behind me had a mask on. (13:50)
Right, right. A lot of people had masks and it was outside. (13:57)
Okay. What’s your next question, Lesley? We’re outside. The rallies are bigger than they’ve ever been. There’s more enthusiasm than we’ve ever had. There has never been anything like what you’re witnessing now and you’ll see that soon. (14:17)
You commented on the size of the rallies. (14:18)
You said they’re not as big as they used to be, and I’m telling you they’re much bigger. (14:31)
Lesley, we handed out masks to everybody that comes to the rally. We tell them to wear the masks. (14:38)
Oh, I don’t know, Lesley. (14:41)
I have no problem, no problem. (14:44)
Next question, go ahead. (14:48)
I hope you’re right. Go ahead. (14:58)
Go ahead. (15:06)
Yeah. (15:12)
It will be. (15:23)
It is developed. It is fully developed. It’s going to be announced very soon. (15:28)
When we see what happens with Obamacare, which is not good. And when we see what happens with Obamacare. (15:36)
And it will be much less expensive than Obamacare, which is a disaster, and it will take care of people with pre-existing conditions. (15:54)
No, they’re won’t. We will make a deal and we will have a great healthcare plan- (15:59)
… with less expensive, less expensive, and a much better plan. (16:06)
You have seen it. I’ve been putting out pieces all over the place and we actually have plans. And we have 180 million people right now have a plan. And you haven’t been watching, you haven’t been watching. (16:27)
Are protected, will be totally protected. (16:30)
They’ll be protected, Lesley. (16:32)
I mean, the people with pre-existing conditions are going to be protected- (16:36)
… as they are now. (16:38)
In any plan we do, they will be protected [crosstalk 00:16:42]. Lesley, people with pre-existing conditions would be always protected, always. (16:55)
We’re going to have to see what happens, it’s got a ways to go. I mean, we’ll see what happens. I think it’ll end … I hope that they end it. It’ll be so good if they end it. (17:05)
Because we will come up with a plan, which will be- (17:08)
Yeah, we will. (17:11)
We have large sections of it already done. And we’ve already come up with plans, take a look at your various secretaries, various plans that we’ve already come up with. And also, a large part of this country has private health insurance, 180 million people. And under that, Biden, he doesn’t have any clue, but under that 180 million people will lose their health care. And they’ll go to socialized medicine, and that’s not going to be acceptable. 180 million people Lesley, will go to socialized medicine. It won’t be … it will not acceptable. (17:53)
Then we’re going to have a new, and we’re going to have new and it’s going to be very good. And it’s going to- (18:01)
We’ve come with many plans, Lesley, and they’re already in existence. I’ll tell you what, after this interview, I will show you short-term, longer term. I’ll show you different plans. We’ve come up with many plans. And we got the individual mandate out. The individual mandate is gone. That was the worst part of Obamacare, that’s gone. (18:33)
Right. (18:41)
No, no. It’s wrong. (18:44)
It’s wrong. A new plan will happen- (18:46)
And we won’t do anything … will and is. We won’t do anything and no plan, unless we have pre-existing conditions covered. And the individual mandate, which you don’t want to mention was terminated. It was terminated. Individual mandate was terminated. That is the biggest thing that’s happened. And that actually makes Obamacare not Obamacare. Because under that, you would pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. We got it terminated, terminated through the legislature, signed, done. That means Obamacare is no longer Obamacare. We got rid of the most important element of Obamacare. And it was the worst element of Obamacare that nobody wanted, nobody liked. So Obamacare essentially was terminated as we know it. Now we have the carcass of Obamacare- (19:38)
We managed it well. Lesley, we’ve managed it well. I had a choice to make, when we got rid of the individual mandate, nobody believed we could do that and I did it. I had a choice to make. Do I manage the remainder of whatever’s left of this whole thing called Obamacare, which is no good, do I manage it well or manage it badly? If I manage it well, politically, maybe that’s not good [crosstalk 00:20:03]. I decide-(20:03)
Politically, maybe that’s not good. I decided to manage it well. (20:07)
No, I don’t want to leave it, I want to see what happens. Here’s what happens. We may be stuck with it if we lose in the Supreme Court, in which case, we’re wasting a lot of words. If we win, we will come up with a much… And we will do that. Come up with a much better healthcare for much less money, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions. (20:35)
No, you’re only trying to… I wish you would interview Joe Biden like you interview me. It would be so good. You know what? (20:44)
I don’t mind it, I don’t mind it. But when I watch him walk out of his store, he’s in the midst of a scandal, his family is corrupt, okay? He’s corrupt. He’s a corrupt politician. And he’s walking with ice cream. And the question the media asks him, what kind of ice cream? What flavor ice cream do you have? And he’s in the midst of a scandal. (21:06)
Of course he is, Lesley. (21:08)
Of course he is. See that? (21:12)
You’re like big tech, you protecting him. And everyone is, except for a few people. (21:22)
Lesley, let me ask you. You think it’s okay for the Mayor of Moscow’s wife to give him millions and millions of dollars, three and a half million dollars, to give his family three and a half? Do you think it’s okay for Hunter Biden to say that we’re giving the big guy 10% of this massive amount of money they’re taking? Do you think it’s okay for all of these horrible things that you’ve seen, where they’re getting hundreds of thousands, and millions of dollars, where China gives them a billion and a half dollars to manage, the family, a billion and a half dollars, and then he’s supposed to negotiate? Let me tell you, it’s the second biggest scandal. The biggest scandal was when they spied on my campaign. They spied on my campaign. (22:07)
Of course there is. Is it’s all over the place. Lesley, they spied on my campaign and they got caught. (22:21)
You won’t put it up because it’s bad for Biden. (22:24)
Lesley, they spied on my campaign. (22:27)
It’s been totally verified. Just go down and get the papers. They spied of my campaign, they got caught. (22:35)
And then they went much further than that, and they got caught. And you will see that, Lesley. And you know that, but you just don’t want to put it on the air. (22:44)
Okay. (22:45)
So why don’t you get back to your interview and let’s go. (22:59)
I said that jokingly, that is sarcastic. Nobody likes me, it must be my personality. I say it all the time. Nobody likes me, it must be my personality. I say it all the time, Lesley. (23:18)
No, I think I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t have social media, because the media is corrupt. In my opinion, the media is corrupt. But the media is fake, and frankly, if I didn’t have social media, I’d have no way of getting out my voice. (23:39)
Yeah. (23:48)
I don’t have to discredit you. (23:51)
You’ve discredited yourself. (23:53)
Lesley, you’ve discredited yourself. When you say that you’re not going to cover Biden, you’re going to ask him what flavor ice cream he has, okay. (24:03)
Instead of, “Why did Hunter get three and a half million dollars from Moscow?” Instead of, “Why is an energy company paying your son $183,000 a month, or whatever they’re paying him?” And he has no experience in energy. You discredit yourself. I don’t have to discredit you. (24:33)
I don’t know anything about that. I just know it’s a laptop and they haven’t- (24:43)
I don’t know about the two gentleman you mentioned. (24:47)
It’s a very important issue to find out whether or not a man is corrupt, who’s running for president. Who’s accepted money from China, and from Ukraine, and from Russia. Yeah, I think that’s an important issue. (24:58)
It’s incredible the way you can try and say this and sit there and look me in the eye and say it. He accepted money, his family, from Russia, from Ukraine, from China and from other places. His brother who didn’t have experience became a big builder in Iraq, without experience. Take a look at what’s going on, Lesley. And then you say that shouldn’t be discussed? It’s the biggest scandal out there, Lesley. (25:30)
I think it’s one of the biggest scandals I’ve ever seen, and you don’t cover it. You want to talk about- (25:37)
You want to talk about insignificant things. (25:41)
Of course it can be verified. Excuse me, they found a laptop. Lesley, listen. (25:47)
What can’t be verified? (25:48)
Why do you say that? Even the family hasn’t… The family on the laptop… He’s gone into hiding for five days, he’s gone into hiding. (26:01)
Oh, it’s taking him five days to prepare? I doubt it, I doubt it. Okay, go ahead. (26:10)
No, I think it is what it is. (26:13)
Where are we sitting down? Where are we sitting? (26:15)
Of what? (26:18)
That’s right. How did I get here? How did I get here? We’re in the White House. (26:25)
No, not the name calling. Doing the right thing, and we have a great record. I mean, we got hit by a pandemic, wasn’t my fault. But it was China’s fault. But Lesley, we’re in the White House. The press is very biased, very, very biased. And I’m not talking about [crosstalk 00:26:47] I’m talking about… No. (26:49)
No, I’m not. You’re discrediting yourself, Lesley. (26:52)
Lesley, you’re discrediting yourself. When you don’t go after Biden with the corruption in the Biden family. (27:00)
When you don’t go after what happened in the Russia witch hunt, which turned out to be a total phony with no collusion, no collusion whatsoever. When you don’t do that, you discredit yourself. The press is highly discredited right now, you do know that? So you discredit yourself. (27:30)
They were starting to, Lesley. When the economy was, just prior to the plague, they were starting to really like… We were all starting to like each other. It was coming together. There was going to be a lot of unification. (27:51)
I’m just telling you- (27:53)
People were calling me- (27:56)
People were calling me about coming together, and then we got hit by the plague. And now we’re rebuilding it again. And it’s going well. (28:08)
I do. I think I do unify the country, I think I will unify the country. It’s called success. When our country becomes, again- (28:26)
I’d like not to, but perhaps everybody has to take a little responsibility for it. But when people put out phony witch hunts, when they spy on your campaign, you have to fight back. And if you don’t fight back, you’re not sitting here very long. You go back home. You go back home to mommy. (28:55)
I don’t think so. It’s not attack. (28:57)
It’s defense, it’s defense against attacks. (29:06)
It’s defense against attacks. (29:06)
I don’t think so. I mean, I don’t view it that way. I’m defending myself and I’m defending the institution of the Presidency. Very important. (29:16)
Hi Mike, are you having a good time, Mike, watching? You know Mike, right? Our great Vice President. (29:24)
You think she would ask questions like this of- (29:31)
No? I don’t think so, either. You think she would ask questions like this of Joe? I don’t think so. (29:41)
Yeah, I think I can. People that love our country. And people that don’t want to see the stores get looted and burned down, and people that don’t want to see riots, and they don’t want to see anarchists. Yeah, I think I can. These are people that love our country, and they don’t like to see- (29:58)
They don’t like to see policemen get shot and not be able to defend themselves.(30:03)
… didn’t get shot and not be able to defend themselves. They don’t like to see rioting in the middle of 5th Avenue or the middle of other streets in Portland or other places.(30:14)
And they like it when their President gets the endorsement of virtually every police group, and frankly, almost everybody having to do with law and order. Positive law and order. But you know what they are? They’re people that love our country more than anything else, and they’d like to see our country thrive. (30:41)
I don’t encourage them. They say it. (30:47)
Hillary Clinton deleted, she deleted 33,000 emails after she got a subpoena from the United States Congress. (30:54)
No, no. That’s illegal. (30:56)
Why somebody doesn’t do something about it- (31:00)
I think it’s an issue. (31:04)
To me it’s an issue. Excuse me, when they say lock her up, it’s not me. They say it. It starts, it ends up being- (31:10)
I don’t encourage it. (31:11)
No. If I mention her name about something, they go crazy. (31:22)
I don’t know anything about the plot but I can- (31:23)
But I can tell you this, it was our justice department that is the one that’s helping her. My justice department, if you call it that, (31:32)
It was our justice department that’s helping her. And people aren’t so… They’re not liking her so much because she’s got everybody locked down.(31:42)
Now we just won a Supreme Court where it’s unconstitutional. The only one she doesn’t have locked down is her husband who went sailing and did things that he wasn’t supposed to be doing. (32:01)
I haven’t gone after her. (32:09)
I haven’t gone after her- (32:10)
I’ve helped her. (32:11)
It was our justice department that’s helping her. (32:15)
Oh, I do criticize her, yeah. (32:17)
I think the way she locked down Michigan is a disgrace. (32:20)
The way she closed churches in Michigan is a disgrace. Yeah, I think it’s disgraceful what she’s done. I do. (32:28)
By the way that’s other… Of course not. That’s other governors also. They happen to be Democrats and they’ve closed up their states and they’re causing a lot of problems with these lockdowns. Suicide, drugs, alcohol, a lot of bad things are happening and they should open up their states. Carefully, but they should open up their states. (32:56)
Oh, I say carefully. (33:04)
The governors run their states. (33:06)
We help them a lot, but the governors run their states. (33:10)
And the governors have to do what they have to do. But when they locked down Michigan, she’s doing a tremendous disservice. (33:17)
Same thing with Pennsylvania. Same thing with North Carolina. (33:22)
These are Democrat governors and they’re doing a great disservice. (33:30)
I say- (33:32)
I say, I’m not against masks at all- (33:35)
Sure I am. Wear them. Wear them. But I also say socially distance. I say all the things, but you know what? Well, look, with you, nothing I said would be any good, Lesley. (33:48)
That’s okay. (33:50)
But in the meantime, we’re having a record comeback because if you look, we’re the fastest growing nation in the world after this pandemic by far. And we sunk less than any other nation, relatively speaking, and we’re coming back very strong. Very, very strong. (34:19)
When did I lock her up? I never said that. (34:21)
When did I say lock up the Governor? I didn’t say, “Lock up the Governor.” (34:23)
Why would I lock her up? No, but why didn’t you say, “You don’t want to lock up the Governor?” Of course I don’t want to lock her up. Why would I lock her up? (34:34)
I never said it, Lesley. I never said, “Lock up the Governor.” (34:39)
Lesley, it’s such a vicious that you just said. I never said, “Lock up the Governor of Michigan.” I would never say that. (34:45)
Why would I say that? (34:47)
She’s doing lockdowns. (34:50)
No, I don’t want to lock them up, but they certainly should be looked at. (34:55)
No, I don’t want to lock him up, but he spied on my campaign. (34:58)
Obama and Biden spied on my campaign. Do you know what that is? You know what they did? Do you know how horrible it is, what they did? (35:08)
It’s been totally verified, Lesley. (35:10)
You’ll find out, but it’s been totally verified. (35:29)
Oh, he probably will because I think he’s a very dishonest guy and he probably will look for something. Probably will. We’ll see. But you know what? Attorney General Barr has been very nice. That’s all I can tell you. He’s been very nice. He’s been very respectful. (35:46)
No I didn’t criticize him, it’s just a different personality. They’re very lucky. They’re very lucky because the evidence is overwhelming and Attorney General Barr is a great gentleman. He’s a great gentleman. They are very lucky.(36:01)
No, I can’t tell you what’s going to happen. I don’t know- (36:04)
Because I purposely like to stay out of it. You know what? I don’t like to get invol… I can if I want, but I don’t like to get involved.(36:11)
But I think they’ve been very, very lucky. Attorney General Barr is a gentleman. (36:16)
Of course you did. (36:18)
Of course you did. (36:23)
Well, then you brought up a lot of subjects- (36:25)
… that were inappropriately brought up. (36:27)
They were inappropriately brought up, right from the beginning. Your first question was, “This is going to be tough questions.” (36:34)
Well, you set up the interview. It was your first statement was- (36:41)
Excuse me, no, no. Listen, your first statement to me, “This is going to be tough questions.” Well, I don’t mind that. When you set up the interview, you didn’t say that. You said, oh, let’s have a lovely interview. And here’s what I do say. (36:53)
You don’t ask Joe Biden. I saw your interview with Joe. The interview with Joe. It was a joke. The interview, 60 Minutes. I see Joe Biden giving softball after softball. I’ve seen all of his interviews. He’s never been asked a question that’s hard- (37:13)
No, but you- (37:13)
… start with me. Excuse me, Lesley. You started with me. Your first statement was, “Are you ready for tough questions?” (37:22)
That’s no way to talk. That’s no way to talk.7:25)
Lesley, one second. This is the first warning. I think we have five minutes until we have the Vice President step in, is that about right?(37:34)
Well, I think we have enough. Really, we have enough.7:38)
I think we’re waiting for the Vice President now.(37:40)
I think we have enough of an interview here, okay? That’s enough. Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go meet for two seconds, okay? Thanks. I’ll see you later. Thanks."
trump_abcnews_interview.txt,"(00:30)
Thank you very much. (00:34)
I can see, definitely. There’s no doubt about it. (00:52)
Hi, Paul. (01:22)
Well, we really didn’t, Paul. We’ve worked very hard on the pandemic. We’ve worked very hard. It came off from China. They should have never let it happen. If you look at what we’ve done with ventilators and now, frankly, with vaccines, we’re very close to having a good vaccine. If you want to know the truth, the previous administration would have taken perhaps years to have a vaccine because of the FDA and all the approvals. And we’re within weeks of getting it, could be three weeks, four weeks, but we think we have a Johnson & Johnson Pfizer. We have great companies and they’re very, very close. It’s a terrible thing. But if you look at as an example, are you from New York? Where are you from? (02:12)
Well, that’s very good. It’s a good place. But actually, if you look at what we’ve done for various things, we built hospitals. New York, we took the Convention Center, converted it to 2,800 rooms. We brought in the ships. I wish they would have used it because frankly they would have saved a lot of people had they used it, but we really are. We’re starting to get very good marks. If you look at what we’ve done compared to other countries with the excess mortality, the excess mortality rate, we’ve done very, very well.(02:40)
When you see our testing, we’re going to be at 84 million tests, 84 million. Think of that. And next would be India with about 50 million less. Our testing program’s far greater. I brought this along today because I think it’s something that’s really very special. We have a new test that came out literally today, that’s just showing you a numbers of how well we’re doing relative to other countries.(03:05)
But this is actually a new test just came out from Abbott, highly sophisticated. You wouldn’t think it’s a piece of a really little light cardboard. This came out and this is a very accurate test and people will be able to have this and they’ll be able to test or ideally go through a doctor. But it’s very simple and very accurate.(03:27)
We supplied governors including this state with equipment like nobody’s ever gotten. We were short on ventilators because the cupboards were bare when we took it over. We’re now making thousands of ventilators a month, many thousands that we’re sending, and we don’t need them in our country anymore. Not one person that needed a ventilator, didn’t get a ventilator. Everybody got a ventilator and, Paul, they’re very complex. They’re very hard to make, but we’re making out tens of thousands a month and sending them to other countries who are in dire need of them.(03:59)
I feel that we’ve done a tremendous job, actually and it’s something that I don’t think it’s been recognized like it should. But when you look at our testing, when you look at our swabs, when you look at our ventilators, when you look at what we’ve done with hospitals, and we’ve made a lot of governors look very good and now some are in a shutdown and some aren’t, we’d like to see it open up and open up as soon as possible. But we’re very proud of the job we’ve done, and we’ve saved a lot of lives, a tremendous number of lives. (04:44)
The excess mortality rate is among the best in the whole world. I mean, I can show you there’s a chart that just came out a little while ago. Excess mortality rate is compared to Europe, compared to other places, it’s about 25% better. In one case, it’s over 60% better. And we also have a very big country here. This is, we’re talking about a lot bigger than most countries. When you look at testing, just as an example, when India does 40 million less tests than us, they have 1.5 billion people. China, you don’t get the accurate numbers out of China, but China, they lost a lot of people. They just don’t say what- (05:28)
Well, we have 20% of the cases because of the fact that we do much more testing. If we wouldn’t do testing, you wouldn’t have cases. You would have very few cases. (05:38)
Well, Dr. Fauci, said we’ve done a fantastic job. He just said it yesterday. Actually, he said we’ve done a fantastic job that we didn’t mislead anybody. Now. I’m not going to make people feel like I want to… Look, with a leader of a great country, we want to keep it that way. I don’t want to scare people. I don’t want to make people panic and you’re not going to go out and say, “Oh, this is going to be. This is death, death, death.” You have to run a country. We’re in a country. We got hit by something very unfairly.(06:08)
What I noticed yesterday Dr. Fauci, said that we’ve done a really good job and we didn’t mislead anybody. He came out with that statement, which I appreciate. But whether it’s Dr. Fauci, or anybody else, a lot of people got it wrong. They talked about, don’t wear masks, and now they say wear masks, although some people say don’t wear masks. I mean, you have a lot of different ideas. Some people say, “Just leave it the way it is and don’t do any shutdowns.” Other people say, “Do shutdowns.” I have my own views on that. (06:50)
Not down playing- (06:51)
Not downplaying. (06:54)
I don’t want to drive our nation into a panic. I’m a cheerleader for this nation. I’m the one that closed up our country. I closed it up long before any of the experts thought I should and saved hundreds of thousands of lives. But when I closed it, I put a ban on our country. And the ban was a very important ban because China [crosstalk 00:07:12]. China was heavily infected.(07:15)
By the way, I read where other people said, “Do it.” No people that I saw said do it, and I know they said security advisers and others. I put a ban on when it wasn’t at all popular. Joe Biden said I was xenophobic because I put the ban on, and I thought that was a very unfair. By the way, he’s totally taken that back. But I’m not sure he knows what it means, anyway. (07:48)
I don’t think I did. We just finished a trade deal. We just had the largest order of corn in the history of our country last week, the largest order of soybeans, largest order of beef, because they know I’m very unhappy. They know I’m very, very- (08:02)
No, I didn’t say one way or the other. I’m not saying one way or the other. At the beginning before anybody knew what it was, I spoke with President Xi and he said, “We are doing it well. We are having it under control.” And I was very open with that. He told me that it was under control, that everything was, and it turned out to be not true, because it wasn’t under control. It went all over the world, 188 countries.(08:25)
I didn’t say anything bad about President Xi initially, because nobody knew much about the disease. Nobody knew the seniors are susceptible. They thought people would be susceptible, but not… The seniors are really a very, very endangered group of people, especially if they have problems with hearts or diabetes or any of that. (09:02)
Well, I do wear them when I have to, and when I’m in hospitals and other locations. But I will say this, they said at the Democrat Convention, they’re going to do a national mandate. They never did it, because they’ve checked out and they didn’t do it. A good question, as you ask, like Joe Biden, they said, “We’re going to do a national mandate unrest-” (09:26)
No, but he didn’t do it. I mean, he never did it. By the way, a lot of people don’t want to wear masks. There are a lot of people think that masks are not good. And there are a lot of people that, as an example, you have- (09:39)
I’ll tell you who those people are, waiters. They come over and they serve you, and they have a mask. I saw it the other day where they were serving me and they’re playing with a mask. I’m not blaming them. I’m just saying what happens. They’re playing with a mask, and so the mask is over and they’re touching it. And then they’re touching the plate. That can’t be good.(09:58)
There are a lot of people, if you look at Dr. Fauci’s original statement, you look at a lot of people, CDC, you look at a lot of people’s original statement, they said very strongly George, “Don’t wear masks.” Then all of a sudden they want to wear masks. The concept of a mask is good, but it also does, you’re constantly touching it, you’re touching your face, you’re touching plates. There are people that don’t think masks are good. (10:47)
Yeah. Well, I didn’t downplay it. I actually, in many ways I applied it in terms of action. [crosstalk 00:10:54]. My action was very strong because what I did was with China, I put a ban on, with Europe, I put a ban on, and we would have lost thousands of more people had I not put the ban on. So that was called action. Not with the mouth, but in actual fact, we did a very, very good job when we put that ban on, whether you call it talent or luck, it was very important. So we saved a lot of lives when we did that. (11:22)
Well, they were Americans. I mean, the holes in were if you have somebody in China, that’s an American citizen, we had to let them in. I mean, there were actually some people that said, well, once it got going, they said, “Wait a minute. That is really a heavily infected place.” We had a case where we had a lot of Americans, they probably had COVID and we’re saying, “Do we let them into our country?” We let them in very carefully. We quarantined them, but we let them in. But yeah, they say that we allowed certain people and it’s true, but they were American citizens. (12:07)
I think we could have had 2 million deaths if we didn’t close out the country. (12:12)
No, I think we did a great job. If we didn’t close the country, look, we created, I created, we all created it together. You helped everybody. The fact is, we created the greatest economy in the history of the world, best employment numbers for African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, women, everything, the best employment, high school, no high school, college. We had the best economy we’ve ever had. 160 million people almost, just short of 160 million people. We were never closed.(12:42)
And then somebody comes in and then somebody else, doctors, and they start talking about the pandemic and about closing, they want to close up our country. I said, “Wait a minute. We have the greatest country, the greatest economy.” And it was coming together, even in terms of unity, because it was so successful that people that weren’t getting along were starting to get along, George. That’s the way we solved that problem. But we had the greatest economy ever, and we have to close it. If I didn’t close it, I think you’d have 2 million deaths instead of having the 185, 190. It’s a terrible. [crosstalk 00:13:15]. (13:21)
George, I was so far ahead of my closing. I’ll give you an example. When I closed at the end of January, Joe Biden was talking about in March about it’s totally over-exaggerated. Nancy Pelosi was standing in the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco, late a month, more than a month after that saying, “This thing’s totally exaggerated, come to try and build up tourism.” And all of these people- (13:51)
What? (13:53)
It is going to disappear. It’s going to disappear. I still say that. (13:58)
No, I still say it. It’s going to disappear, George. We’re going to get back. We aren’t going to have studios like this. We have all of this empty space in between. I want to see people and you want to see people. I want to see football games. I’m pushing very hard for Big Ten. I want to see Big Ten open, lift the football games, let them play sports. But no, it’s going to disappear, George. And I say this- (14:39)
When Churchill was on the top of a building, and he said, “Everything’s going to be good. Everything’s going to be. Be calm.” And you have the Nazis dropping bombs all over London, he was very brave because he was at the top of a building. It was very well known that he was standing on buildings and they were bombing. And he says, “Everyone’s going to be safe.” I don’t think that’s being necessarily honest, and yet I think it’s being a great leader.(15:03)
But he said, “You’re going to be safe. Be calm. Don’t panic.” And you had bombers dropping bombs all over London. So I guess you could say, that’s not so honest, but it’s still great leadership. (15:19)
I’m not looking to be dishonest. I don’t want people to panic, and we are going to be okay. We’re going to be okay, and it is going away. It’s probably going to go away now a lot faster because of the vaccine. It would go away without the vaccine, George, but it’s going to go away a lot faster- (15:34)
Sure. Over a period of time. Sure, with time, it goes away. (15:39)
You’ll develope like a hard mentality, it’s going to be hard developed, and that’s going to happen. That will all happen. But with the vaccine, I think it will go away very quickly. (15:50)
But I really believe we’re rounding the corner, and I believe that strongly. (15:55)
Well, I mean, but a lot of people do agree with me. You look at Scott Atlas, you look at some of the other doctors that are highlighted from Stanford, look at some of the other doctors, they think maybe we could have done that from the beginning. I think we did it exactly right. We closed it up. Now, we’re opening and we’re opening up to a super-vee because the numbers are fantastic.(16:15)
The employment numbers, you look at, we hired 10.4 million jobs in four months. That’s a record by far. We have every record. Retail sales are through the roof. We have every record. We did the right thing. If we didn’t close it up, I believe we’d have two million, two and a half, maybe three million deaths. (20:05)
Well, I think they were tragic events, and I do feel that we have to also take into consideration that if you look at our police, they do a phenomenal job. You’ll have people joke, make mistakes, and they happen. It happens where they have to make a fast decision and some bad things happen. And you also have bad apples, but you have 99% great people. I know the police forces very well. I think almost every one of them. If you look, I’ve been endorsed by so many of them, and these are great people.(20:37)
I will say this, if you’re going to stop crime, we have to give the respect back to the police that they deserve. They’ve done a fantastic job in many locations, but then bad things happen. Look at New York, New York was a very safe city. Rudy Giuliani did a fantastic job. The city was safe, and then all of a sudden we have a mayor. He starts cutting the police force and crime is up a hundred percent, 150%. I saw one form of crime up 300%.(21:05)
So I think it’s very important, whether you talk Seattle, where they have very good police, but they’re not allowed to do their job. You have to allow the police to do their job. I agree with you, those events are terrible, but we have to allow the police to do their job. Otherwise, crime is going to soar.(21:22)
Now, the problem is that in Democrat, usually liberal Democrat run cities, we have tremendous problems. The top 10 most unsafe cities are run by Democrats. You go into the top 25 and top 35, almost every one of them is run by Democrats. No cash bail, just weak policies on crime. We have to give the police the respect that they deserve and we have to give them their mojo. We have to let them protect us.(21:52)
How about that horrible crime that took place two days ago, where this terrible human being walks up to a police car with two people sitting in the car and he starts shooting bullets right through the glass right in their face and just has destroyed? I hear they’re going to make it, but they’re going to have a hard time ever being the same- (22:12)
It’s just a terrible thing. (22:18)
But that’s a lack of respect. When somebody can do that, that’s a lack of respect. There’s no retribution. The field, there’s no retribution. This guy walks up to a police car and he starts shooting point blank range at two innocent people. You can’t let that happen. You have to be very tough on crime when it comes to that. (23:02)
So, just do a poll where… (23:03)
I just saw a poll where African-Americans in this country, black communities are 81% in favor of having more police. They want more police. They want protection. They suffer more than anybody else by bad police protection. All minorities, whether it’s Hispanic or black or Asian, they suffer more than anybody else, George. We have to give the police back the authority to stop crime. When you have something like in Portland, where it’s just night after night, I could stop that with the people we have in a half an hour if they’d let me do that, but they don’t- (23:41)
Bring in the National Guard. We’d bring it in, and we would stop that within… Well, we did it in Minneapolis. Take a look at Minneapolis- (23:52)
I can only say this, that the police in this country have done generally a great job. There are crimes, there are problems, and there are chokers. They choke under pressure. They have one quarter of a second to make a decision, and sometimes they make a wrong decision. That’s a terrible thing. The problem is that’ll be on the news for two weeks or three weeks in a row, and the hundreds of thousands and thousands of good acts, nobody talks about it. (24:21)
No, I think there’s problems, but I also think there’s some very big problems where if you don’t give the police back their authority… Right now, police are afraid they’re going to lose their pension, they’re going to lose their job if they talk to somebody in the wrong way. When I watch New York… The New York City Police endorse me, and I love them. [crosstalk 00:24:42] but I watched six months ago, policemen walking down the street, and people were dumping water on their head. They had absolutely no fear. They had absolutely… There was no retribution. I thought it was a low point. I thought it was a low point for New York City’s finest.(24:59)
Frankly, those people should’ve turned… Those cops should’ve turned around and really done something. (25:12)
Good. (25:25)
Well, I can say this. We have tremendous African-American support. You’ve probably seen it in the polls. We’re doing extremely well with African-American, Hispanic-American at levels that you’ve rarely seen a republican have. If you talk about make America great, if you look at just prior to, and I’m talking about for the black community, you look just prior to this horrible situation coming in from China, when the virus came in, that was probably the highest point. Home ownership for the black community, home ownership, lower crime, the best jobs they’ve ever had, highest income, the best employment numbers they’ve ever had. If you go back and you want to look over many years, you could just go back six or seven months from now, that was the best single moment in the history of the African-American people in this country, I think, I would say. (27:22)
If you go… Well, I hope there’s not a race problem. I can tell you, there’s none with me, because I have great respect for all races, for everybody. This country is great because of it, but when you go back six months and you take a look at what was happening, you can’t even compare that with past administrations. When you look at income levels, and a lot of things, because of the job situation, where they had the lowest income, the best unemployment numbers they’ve ever had, the black community, by far, and that was solving a lot of problems. You know what else? It was bringing people together. I was starting to get, just before… We were having a long run of success. I was starting to get calls from democrats that, “Hey, it’s starting to work. Let’s get together.” People that you would never have thought this would’ve happened with, there was going to be unity, but unfortunately, that was hurt because we got set back.(28:14)
Now, I think next year’s going to be one of our best years economically, but [crosstalk 00:28:18] (28:36)
Well, the income inequality, which I agree with you is a problem, I always agreed with that, but if you looked under President Obama and Biden, the income inequality was phenomenal. It was record setting. It was- (28:51)
Well, we’re talking about a plague coming in. Before the plague, we were doing very well. Now, we will soon be doing well again, because we’re going to have a fantastic third quarter. You’re seeing the numbers come in. I think you’re going to have a GDP that’s mid 20s and may be much higher. Somebody said 35. I don’t know. These are all records we’re talking about. You’re going to have a very good… Economically, you’re going to have a very good year next year, but I agree with a lot of the things you say, but you have to look back, because we really had it going well. Had we not been hit by this horrible disease that came into our land and all over the world, by the way, came all over the world, we would be in a position where I think income inequality would be different. It was really getting there. We were really driving it down. (29:45)
I can only compare it to the past. The African-American, the black community was doing better than it had ever done by far, both in terms of unemployment, home ownership, so many different statistics, even in terms of crime- (30:04)
I mean, there was a gap, but we were doing a good job. It was getting better. Then, it was artificially shut down by this disease that came onto our land. (34:39)
Hi. (35:01)
Well, as you know, we did pay check, but we’re doing a lot of other things. But, what I want to do is see some additional stimulus. We’re trying to get it, and we may. I mean, just before I came here, we had some pretty good talks with the democrats. We’ll see, but they’ve been very difficult- (35:17)
Because, they know exactly where I stand. At the right time, I’ll do that, but they know exactly where I stand. What they want is a bail out of democrat run states that are doing poorly. I don’t think this is the right way- (35:30)
They are. (35:32)
No, the democrat run states are the ones that are doing badly, George. If you look at New York, if you look at Illinois, if you look at a lot of different places, they’re doing poorly, and cities in particular. Cities, I mean, these cities are being run so poorly- (35:47)
… but largely because of the crime. They don’t want to do anything about crime. Sanctuary cities. They have sanctuary cities where they’re protecting criminals. They have things that the republicans don’t have. So, they are. I don’t want to say… Look, I’m the president of everybody, but I don’t want to say it, but they’re democrat run cities. It is what it is. (36:09)
At the right time, yes, I would like to see additional stimulus for people that really, it wasn’t their fault. It wasn’t your fault, wasn’t anybody’s fault. It was China’s fault. I don’t care how you want to define it. This was China’s fault, and our people shouldn’t be hurt. We should do stimulus. We did a lot of it initially, and now they stopped, because they think it’s going to be better for the election. (36:37)
Well, we can do something maybe, but I’m just hearing for the first time about an hour ago that maybe there is a chance to get something, and I’d like to do it. I would like to see it happen, George. (36:55)
Hi. (37:27)
That’s great. (37:47)
No. (38:22)
First of all, I hope you are taken seriously. I hope you are. We are not going to hurt anything having to do with preexisting conditions. We’re not going to hurt preexisting conditions, and in fact, just the opposite. If you look at what they want to do, where they have socialized medicine, they will get rid of preexisting conditions. If they go into Medicare for all, which is socialized medicine, and you can forget about your doctors and your plans, just like you can forget under President Obama. He said you can have your doctor, you can have your plan, and that turned out to be a lie. He said it 28 different times, at least. We have 28 different times. You can have your doctor, you can have your plan. Well, it’s not true. But, what we’re doing is we’re going to be doing a healthcare plan, preexisting, protecting people with preexisting conditions. As an example, yourself. It sounds like that’s exactly perfect. That’s exactly what we’re talking about. We’re going to be doing a healthcare plan very strongly, and protect people with preexisting conditions.(39:21)
I will say this, they will not do that, because they have socialized- (39:59)
No, so we can do new healthcare. (40:12)
I have it already. I have it already. (40:16)
It doesn’t matter. I have it already, and it’s a much better plan for you, and it’s a much better plan. (40:21)
When you say Obamacare, I got rid of the individual mandate, which is the worst part of Obamacare. (40:27)
Wouldn’t pertain to you, but it’d pertain to a lot of people where they were going literally bust because they didn’t want to have health insurance, and they were paying for it anyway, and it was no good. Obamacare was a disaster. Obamacare is too expensive. The premiums are too high. It’s a total disaster. You’re going to have new healthcare, and the preexisting condition aspect of it will always be in my plan, and I’ve said that loud and clear- (40:52)
And, we got rid of the individual mandate, which essentially ended Obamacare- (40:59)
George, I had a decision to make. Do I run… We gutted out the worst parts of Obamacare. Now, I have to make this decision. This is three years ago. Do we run Obamacare well and do a good job, and do the best, even though it’s never going to be very good, or do we let it run badly? Probably letting it run badly would’ve been a better political decision, but I couldn’t do that. We have run it so much better than Obama ran it. Now, it’s not the same because I got rid of the most unpopular thing and a very unfair thing, which was the individual mandate. (41:34)
George, we have run it really well, but we also have now other… If you go to Department of Labor, our great secretary as you know, and you know him well, we have other alternatives to Obamacare that are 50% less expensive, and they’re actually better. (41:51)
George, it’s been 40 years since you had good healthcare. You never really had good healthcare in this country. This country has never had it. But, when you say that Biden doesn’t want to do it, everybody else does. Bernie does. He agreed to the manifesto as I call it. The agreement with Bernie is that you’re going to go to socialized medicine. (42:14)
If you go to socialized medicine… Well, he agreed. Harris, who he today, said, Harris-Biden, because you think she’s president, Harris… Someday, you’ll have to explain that one to me, but Harris is all for doing that. She wants to go to socialized medicine. You no longer have your doctor really, and you no longer have your plan. And, Joe can say all he wants, he’s only doing it because he sees his poll numbers going down so substantially. But, Joe can say all he wants about healthcare. Obamacare has been a failure from day one. It’s too expensive, whether it’s the premium or whether it’s the cost generally, and they don’t have their doctors, and they don’t have their plans. We’re going to have a very good healthcare. I think maybe a great healthcare for less money. (48:26)
Thank you. (48:32)
Hi Jim. (48:48)
Good Jim. So I’m fighting a battle, it’s a big battlefield and I have a lot of forces against me. I have the media, which I call the fake news, because a lot of it is fake. And I mean a big pop, as you understand, a lot of is fake. I’m fighting a lot of forces. Sometimes you don’t have time to be totally, as you would say, presidential. You have to get things done. I think I’ve done more than any other president in the first three and a half years. When you look at what we’ve done for tax cuts and regulation cuts and the vets, all of the things that we’ve done for the West, we have a 91% approval factor now for the vets, we rebuilt our military, we created Space Force. I mean, we did so many things, Right-to-try, which is so incredible and so successful. You know what Right-to-try is?(49:35)
We did more, I really believe it, more than any other president in the first three and a half years. By the way, at the end of my first term, we’re going to have close to 300, maybe over 300 new federal judges, including Court of Appeal, two Supreme Court justices. And honestly, we move very fast and I have to get rid of people fast because they’re not doing their job. I could tell you people that weren’t doing their job. And when I do that to get somebody else that is good, and if they don’t do it, we get rid of that person.(50:06)
We do a lot of things and we have to get them done. I could be so pres… I always used to sort of kid on the campaign trail that I could be more presidential, would be very easy, more presidential than any other candidate, except for possibly Abraham Lincoln when he’s wearing the hat, right? The high hat. But the fact is, being presidential is easier than what I have to do, but I get things done. I get things done like nobody’s ever gotten, including environmental things. When you look at what’s going on in the country and all that we’ve done, we unfortunately got hit by this plague, but it’s going to be back very soon, we opened it up and we have…you talk Jim about the V. We have a super V, looks like it’s going to be a super V.(50:47)
We’re going to have a great economy next year. And I think we’re going to have a great economy in the third quarter. And thank you for voting for me in 2016. I hope you’re going to do it again. (50:57)
Thank you. Thank you very much. (51:11)
George, stocks are owned by everybody. I mean, they talk about the stock market is so good, that’s 401(k)s. I’m meeting people with as long as they didn’t sell when the market went down, when we first realized the extent of this horrible thing from China. I mean, these people are doing, some of them are doing better than they were doing before the pandemic came. (51:31)
If people held onto their stocks, and remember this, because I noticed you said wealthy, sure, wealthy, but you have people that aren’t wealthy, but have done well because of the stock market. I’ve set records on the stock market even during the pandemic. And that doesn’t happen by accident. I will tell you this, if Joe Biden ever got this position and that’s a headwind on the stock market, our stock market would be much higher if it weren’t for that. If Joe Biden ever got in, I think you’d have a depression, the likes of which we’ve never seen in this country. If you look at his policies, where he wants to raise everybody’s taxes, you look at what he wants to do in terms of regulation, where he wants to put all of the regulations back on that I took off, and then some, and in many cases, double it up, you will have a depression, the likes of which we haven’t seen in this country, and that doesn’t affect big people.(52:22)
It affects everybody. It affects a person that owns $10,000 worth of stock in IBM or whatever company it may be. Look, we’re having a tremendous thing in the stock market and that’s good for everybody, but people that aren’t rich own stock and they have 401(k)s. You take a look at the 401(k)s. They’re in many cases better than they were before the pandemic came. (52:53)
Thank you. (53:04)
Could you say that again? (53:17)
Oh, oh, I see. Okay. It was a fake statement. Go ahead (53:32)
It’s easy, because they never made those statements. They were never made by me. They said, I stood over the grave of soldiers killed many years ago, and I said they were suckers. I never made that. We had 26 people as of today, come out to say it never happened, and many people were there. Then they said about the rain didn’t happen and that wasn’t the reason. The secret service said, we have a statement from them. They said that we could not travel because the helicopter couldn’t be used, we would not be able to travel. Because when you do that through a major city, it takes them days to get it prepared. I wanted to go anyway. I said, “Let me just go separately in a car in disguise. I don’t care.” I wanted to be there so badly, but the statements never happened. They were lies.(54:15)
As far as John McCain, I was never a fan of John McCain. I never thought he treated our vets well, he didn’t do the job. I was never a fan of his, and I think that’s fine and everybody knows that, and I said it to his face. I was very much up in that. (54:31)
But as far as [inaudible 00:54:30], I have done so much for our vets and for our military, I rebuilt our military. When I came into this great office, our military was depleted, it was in the worst shape it was in probably ever. It was depleted. The planes were old and broken, the ships, everything. You see what I’ve done. I’ve rebuilt $2.5 trillion, and you think that was easy, getting that money from Democrats? Because they don’t like the military. This magazine came up, they made up this quote. It was a made up quote. And the gloves are off with Biden who I’ve never respected greatly. I’ve never respected him greatly. But when they took this made up quote that was now knocked out by over 25 people and they made an ad out of it, I thought it was a disgrace. Do you know what disinformation is? That’s what it was.(55:22)
They made up a phony quote and then they went with it. It was a phony deal. And the one who started it was a big friend of President Obama and Clinton. And it was a phony deal from a very not very successful [inaudible 00:55:34]. (55:51)
They didn’t hear me say that. (55:56)
Because I never said it. (56:14)
These are people that I let go. These are disgruntled former employees to put it in a nice way with a term people would understand. Mattis was a highly overrated general, didn’t do the job, didn’t do good on ISIS. I took over a hundred percent of the ISIS caliphate. I had the people that I wanted and Mattis was fired as you know by President Obama. And I fired him also. (56:36)
He didn’t resign. I said, “Give me a letter.” No more. Give me a letter. I was being nice. One of the problems when you’re nice, oftentimes it comes back to hit you. I said, “Jim, give me a letter. It’s time for you to move on.” He gave me a letter, but I fired him, [inaudible 00:56:50], I fired him. Now, General Mattis Didn’t do the job. I wasn’t happy with him. If you look at John Bolton, John Bolton, all he wanted to do is blow people up. He wanted to go to war with everybody. And frankly, I used him very nicely. I bring him into a room in a negotiation, when people saw them, they said, “Oh wow, he’s going to go to war.” I’m bringing our troops back from Afghanistan. I’m bringing our troops back from Iraq. We’re almost out of almost every place. Everybody said because of my personality, they said, “He’ll be in a war immediately.” Look at North Korea, how that’s worked out. The sanctions are on, everything’s the same, we haven’t spent anything. We’re getting along with him, I get along with Kim Jong-un.(57:36)
That was supposed to be a war. If President Obama were president, if Hillary Clinton ever got in, that would be a war. We would have a war, probably a nuclear war with North Korea. In the meantime, I’m getting calls all the time from friends of mine in South Korea. “Thank you. We love you. Thank you.” It’s really been rather amazing. So instead of wars, everybody said, look at what we had today with the United Arab Emirates, UAE, and just take a look at what happened with Israel today with that. Take a look at what’s going on. That was going to be a problem. We’re actually creating peace in the Middle East without blood staining our sand. Look at what happened with Bahrain- (58:19)
George, look at what happened with Bahrain. Well, a guy like Jim Mattis would have disagreed with the way I went about it, and I’ve turned out to be correct. Tom Friedman of the New York Times wrote incredible glowing articles last week about this incredible thing that I’ve been able to do in the Middle East. A guy like Jim Mattis could have never done it because they were all doing it the old fashioned way. They were going in the wrong outlets and the wrong doors. And what happened today with the UAE, and with Bahrain, and with Israel, people don’t even believe it. And George, as sure as you’re sitting there, I have numerous other countries in that region that are going to be signing very soon also. You’ll have peace in the Middle East, and this is without war and without losing, and I’m talking about on both sides, but without losing our great young soldiers.(59:09)
I go to Dover and I greet oftentimes soldiers coming in, and they’re dead. And there’s no sadder thing than to sit with a widow or a mother and watch these big, massive cargo planes, and that back opens up and these incredible Marines are walking off a casket and they were killed in the Middle East. And in many ways, nobody even knows why. Going there was the worst decision in the history of our country. We’ve spent $8 trillion and we’ve lost thousands of lives, but really millions of lives because I view both sides. Okay? If that’s okay. Millions of lives, this was the worst decision. And by the way, Iraq did not… Saddam Hussein did not knock down the World Trade Center in case you don’t know, and I’m sure you do know that. They said they had weapons of mass destruction, they made a mistake. So we’re now $8 trillion. We’ve been in there for 20 years, almost 20 years in Afghanistan. I guess it’s getting very close to that, it’s over 19 and we’re bringing our soldiers back home.(01:00:18)
Nobody expected that from me and people are so happy about it. And you know who’s the happiest? The soldiers. I see them all the time. “What do you think? Should we be here?” “No, sir. You shouldn’t be here.” “Why?” “They don’t like us, sir.” And I’ll tell you what, I’ve rarely met a soldier that’s over there. They’re better than anybody because they can tell you better than anybody what’s happening. Rarely do I meet a soldier that says we should be there. It was the worst mistake, the most costly mistake in the history of our country, going into the Middle East. (01:06:30)
So we have a great Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina, and he had a plan that was very much of a compromise plan, but it was a plan that everybody pretty much agreed to. A lot of Democrats agreed to it, but they wouldn’t vote for it. And it was a really good, it was a compromise of a lot of different factors, and it didn’t get done, and it should have gotten done and it could still be out there, it could still be resurrected very easily, but they just didn’t want to do it. Because I think the Democrats are viewing this as a political issue, and I probably agree with them. I think it’s very bad for them because we’re about law and order, we have to be about law and order. Otherwise you’re going to see your cities burn and that’s the way it is.(01:07:10)
If we can do a plan like Tim Scott’s plan, which is really, it goes far enough, but it doesn’t take the dignity away from our police. We have incredible people. They’ve been protecting us for a long time. I mean, we are here, and I feel very safe being in this room. These are great people. We can’t take their dignity away. We have to let them be able to do what they do better than anybody else. So I think we have to look at it that way. We have to be very, very careful. Police are so afraid today, that they do something slightly wrong, slightly wrong, and their pension’s gone, their job’s gone, who knows what happens? Their life is ruined, their wife or their husband will leave, the whole thing, it’s a very scary thing to do.(01:07:52)
And then you look at safety. I mean, you look at that horrible human being that shot these two police, [inaudible 01:07:59] right next, just a disgusting and then ran off. You look at that. This is a very tough job and it’s a very unsafe job. It’s a very dangerous job. We have to give them back their dignity and we have to give them back respect. These are great people, for the most part. There’s always going to be a bad apple in your business, in my business, no matter what. I mean, there’s going to be bad apples so we have to weed out the bad apples, but we have to give the police back that strength that they had a short while ago and that they have in Republican cities, frankly, and states. But you take a look, this is a Democrat problem.(01:08:39)
George, I know you’re a Democrat, but this is largely a Democrat problem. If you just take a look at the list, every Democrat city, almost, not all, but a lot of them certainly in the top 25, even if you go to the top 50, almost every city is run by the Democrats. People don’t respect our police and they have to respect them- (01:09:02)
Respect our police. (01:09:02)
And they have to respect them. (01:09:08)
And I have, except in Democrat-run cities. Look, we have laws. We have to go by the laws. We can’t move in the National Guard. I can call insurrection, but there’s no reason to ever do that. Even in a Portland case. We can’t call in the National Guard unless we’re requested by a governor. If a governor or a mayor is a Democrat, like in Portland, we call them constantly. I just spoke to the governor yesterday, because we’re giving them relief from the fires. We’re giving them an emergency declaration. I said, “Governor, let us go in and we’ll clean up Portland so fast. In a half an hour, it’ll be all right.” And she’s just torn by it. I don’t understand the thinking, but they are torn by it. I have a lot of respect for the governor, frankly, and what happened in Minneapolis was pretty amazing.(01:09:56)
Unfortunately, it just went on for a week or a week and a half before he allowed us to bring in the National Guard. When we brought in the National Guard, everything stopped, the crime was gone, meaning the whole thing. But by that time, a big portion of the city was burned down. We’re talking about Minneapolis. In Seattle, we let them know we’re coming in. They took over a big chunk of the city, 20% of the city. We said, “We’re coming in.” As soon as we said that the police department went in and these other people were exhausted, but had we not said we’re going in, we were ready to go in, we were going in the following morning, wherever you have a Democrat city, not in all cases, but if you look at the really troubled cities in our country, they’re Democrat-run and that’s Biden.(01:10:43)
They’re weak, they’re ineffective. (01:10:47)
I’m president, but I can only do what I’m allowed to do. George. I don’t need insurrection. I don’t need an insurrection act to take care of 250 anarchists. We can do that very easily with the National Guard. We proved that in Minneapolis. They came in after the city was burning. And the thing I don’t really get is that the news media is saying, “No, these are peaceful. These are peaceful.” And right over the reporter, it was a CNN reporter, right over his shoulder, and you saw that, right over his shoulder, the city is burning. It looked like it was Berlin during the war. It was the craziest thing I’ve ever seen, and he’s trying to say, I don’t know why the news media tries to make so light of it. These are not protests. These are far greater than protests. (01:16:50)
Oh, very good. (01:16:54)
Thank you. (01:17:20)
That’s all right. And just take your time. That’s fine. George has plenty of time. I hope, right? (01:17:25)
Thank you. Did you say your mom got COVID? (01:17:49)
Terrible. And that’s okay. It’s okay. (01:18:41)
Very nice. (01:19:02)
So, we are doing something with immigration that I think is going to be very strong because we want people to come into our country, people like you and like your mother, and that just shows how vicious the COVID is, especially when you have another problem, you have a heart problem or another type of a problem. And it’s a very sad story, but we want people to come into our country. We want them to come in, a lot of people, but we want them to come in through a legal system, through a system that they love our country, they work to come into our country, a merit system, and we’re working on something very hard right now and in a very short time, we’re going to be announcing it. And I think it’s going to have quite an impact. I think it’s going to be something that actually will be popular for all.(01:19:48)
I mean, as far as your situation with your mother, that is just devastating. Because I can imagine how you feel and sounds like a great woman, and I’ll tell you, I’m pretty good with people. She gave us a great daughter, a great child. What she’s done with you, the way you are, the love that you have for your mother, I can see that. It’s hard, and so many people, and they die alone. They die alone because this is such a vicious thing. You can’t go there and hold their hand. You can’t give them a kiss goodnight. It’s a terrible, terrible thing. And hopefully the vaccines are going to be very soon. Hopefully. Did you have COVID? You didn’t have it, right? (01:20:26)
You didn’t have it, mother. We’ll have it taken care of. It’s going to get taken care of. The vaccines are going to make a big difference. What has made a big difference is Remdesevir. We have many things now and things are going to be announced soon, which frankly, if you take a look at some of the things we’re doing in terms of the word wouldn’t be cure, but the word would be therapeutically or therapeutics, we have some incredible things which is so important. And I view that actually in a certain way is more important than the vaccine where you can go into a hospital and get your mother and give her a transfusion or a shot and they can get better, get better much faster. So we have some of those things and they’ve been very, very successful, but we have others coming out and in order to get them, we had to get the FDA to approve these products, these very sophisticated medicines, I guess you could call them medicine, but we had to get them approved very quickly and they did it.(01:21:25)
Dr. Hahn, the head of the FDA, Alex Azar, they’ve really done a fantastic job. I believe George that none of this would have happened in another administration. And I think you know that. The FDA is approving things at a level that they’ve never done and at speed with which they’ve never acted before. (01:27:19)
Hi Ashley. (01:27:29)
So I think without question, I would say, because things were going so well, I think I’d have to say the whole COVID, the China virus as I call it because it comes from China so I think it’s a much more accurate term. But it’s been very difficult, it’s been so sad. As an example, talking to you about your mother, it’s just such a sad situation. Yeah, we’re getting there, we will get there, we’re going to, it’s going to happen, but it’s been very difficult, nobody’s seen anything like this probably since 1970 [inaudible 01:28:03]. (01:28:07)
I learned that life is very fragile. I knew people that were powerful people, strong people, good people, and they got knocked out by this and died. Six people. It was five until about two weeks ago, now it’s six. But I’ve learned that life is very fragile because these were strong people and all of a sudden they were dead, they were gone, and it wasn’t their fault. It was the fault of a country that could have stopped it. And I made a great trade deal with China, (01:28:41)
I feel so differently about that deal now. It’s a great deal. It was good for the farmers, good for the manufacturers, but I don’t view it the same way. It was good for us, but I don’t view it the same way because of the horror of this disease that really could have been stopped at the border. (01:28:59)
I don’t think so. I think what I did by closing up the country, I think I saved two, maybe two and a half, maybe more than that lives. I really don’t think so. I think we did a very good job. I don’t know if that’s been recognized. We’ve made a lot of governors feel good. We’ve made some, reputationally. We’ve enhanced their reputation. They didn’t have anything, we got them the supplies, we got them the ventilators. We’ve made a lot of people look good that shouldn’t look good to be honest with you. (01:29:28)
Thank you very much."
trump_biden_Transcript.txt,"(00:21)
Thank you very much. This is really great. We love this state. We won this state. I don’t know if you know what’s going on outside, but that’s … Right, Lou? That’s as many people as you can possibly have all the way back. How did you get in? That’s my question. I know you’re special friends of a group of people that have done a really good job, and I want to thank you very much for being here. But Pennsylvania has been very important to me. I went to school in Pennsylvania, as you know, college, and I love it. Please sit down. And by the time I finished, I’m going to have a nice sunburn right here. This is good. Where’s my sunblock?(01:02)
But I want to thank everybody. In 75 days, we’re going to win this state. We’re going to win four more years. They’ve had us under siege, and we beat them, and we beat them, and we keep beating them. But I’ll tell you, I’ve never seen anything … No president should have to go through what we’ve gone through. No president. Should never happen. And I watched President Obama last night, and I watched him talking about everything, and I had to put it out. I said, yeah, but he spied on our campaign, and he got caught. That’s about as bad a thing as you can imagine. If that happened to another campaign on the other side, they would have had 25 people in jail for many years already. Many, many years. It’s a disgrace.(01:46)
But in three years, and what we’ve done in just this short period of time, there’s been no administration that’s accomplished what we’ve accomplished, and that’s despite pandemics and despite all of the opposition and all of the witch hunts, the phony witch hunts. No administration has done what we’ve done. We’ve secured our borders, brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt our military, wiped out the ISIS caliphate 100%, killed our terrorist enemies, achieved American energy independence, and guess what? We’re just getting started. That’s just a small part of it. That’s a small part of it.(02:27)
At stake in this election is the, and you know this, you know it, and I mean it, and I’ve never meant it more. At stake in this election is the survival of our nation. It’s true. Because we’re dealing with crazy people in the other side. They’ve gone totally stone cold crazy. You know, you look at Hillary. She was a lot smarter than Joe. But I’ll tell you, there was a certain sense of sanity four years ago. These people have gone insane, and they’re radical left, and you look at some of the things happening in these Democrat- run cities, which we could solve in two minutes. All they’d have to do is call us, right? Our great ex-congressman. All they have to do is … And thank you for being here. But all they have to do is call us. We’ll be in there in two minutes, and we’ll take care of the problem.(03:15)
Joe Biden is a puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life. They don’t understand, and probably when it happened, they’d say, what did we ever do? Joe Biden has pledged to hike your taxes by $4 trillion in the largest tax hike in history. And they’re going to waste the money on the Green New Deal, the Green New Deal. You know what you get out of that? Nothing. Nothing except debt and death. They want to eviscerate the Second Amendment. They want to take away your guns. They want to take away your guns. Well, you remember that, just that one point alone, and they want to take away your guns. So who’s going to vote for that? I mean, we want our Second Amendment. I’ve held it strong, and you think it was easy? I’ve held it totally strong.(04:02)
Give free healthcare to illegal aliens. You don’t get free healthcare? Expand deadly sanctuary cities. Force taxpayers to subsidize late-term abortion. Shut down the energy fields of Pennsylvania. They want to shut them down. No fossil fuels. No fossil fuel. Texas isn’t too happy, either. Go to Texas. I just left Texas a little while ago, two weeks. I said, they don’t want energy, they don’t want guns, and they don’t want religion. A guy stands up, says, “Not going to win Texas!” But you have the same thing, because you do a big, you’re a big fracking state. You want to see your taxes go up? Stop fracking. Doesn’t hurt you at all, fracking. They want to throw up windmills that are going to ruin your houses. Put up a big windmill. You walk out your door. You’ll see those big monsters churning. But even that they don’t want to do. I don’t think they want to do anything. I think they want to close your businesses.(04:59)
But just remember, Second Amendment. They’re going to take it away. As sure as you’re sitting or standing. They’re going to take it away from you. The Second Amendment. Don’t let it happen.(05:08)
Close down charter schools. Eliminate school choice. So important. Abolish the suburbs. They want to put low-income housing in the suburbs. So the American dream … And by the way, we have a lot of minority groups that live in the suburbs. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, all did phenomenally last year with jobs. Best jobs we’ve ever had in the history of our country, the best economy we’ve ever had. But they’re a big part of the suburbs. And they want to put low income housing in the suburbs at a level that they’ve never done it before. And it’s been a very … Look, this has been going on for 20 years. I terminated the regulation that did that. They said, “Well, we can change that.” I said, “No, let’s terminate it.” People have to aspire to go there. They want to aspire to live in the suburbs.(06:00)
They want to abolish cash bail, releasing 400,000 criminals onto our streets. Think of no … No more cash bail. Look at what happened in New York. Cuomo ended cash bail. Cuomo. That wasn’t even DeBlasio that did it. It was Cuomo, the governor. He ended it in New York, and now the crime rate has gone through the roof. The speaker at Biden’s convention, proudly declared, we’re talking about abolishing the police. We’re talking about abolishing ICE, and we’re talking about abolishing prisons. And that’s, the only thing they’re not abolishing are taxes because your taxes are going to go up at a level that you’ve never even heard of before.(06:40)
If you want a vision of your life under Biden presidency, think of the smoldering ruins in Minneapolis, the violent anarchy of Portland, the bloodstained sidewalks of Chicago, and imagine the mayhem coming to your town and every single town in America. You’re not going to have law and order. Do you notice? And I shouldn’t say it because he’ll put it in his speech, if he can read it, which I doubt. But they’ll put it in there tonight. I shouldn’t say it because he’s going to speak later. He’s going to have a good audience. People are going to find out what the hell’s going on. I see he hasn’t answered a question since, they just said … Did you see it on the newscasts? Since July 17th. Hasn’t taken a question from the fake news back there. No, think of it.(07:29)
I take about a hundred questions a day. These people. It’s one thing I’ve learned, the people heading these other countries, whether it’s President Xi of China, Putin of Russia, Erdogan, Turkey, any of them, Kim Jong Un, North Korea. Remember we’re going to be in war with North Korea? Remember? It’s going to be a war? Right, congressman? There’s going to be a war. If Trump’s, oh, we’re going to have a war. No, it would have been a war if you had Hillary Clinton. Would’ve been a war if Obama were allowed to stay any longer. He thought there was going to be a war. Where’s the war? I don’t see the war. Maybe things happen. You don’t know. But there’s been no war. Nobody killed. He would have lost 25, 30 million people. They don’t say that. They say a hundred thousand people. No, no. Seoul is 32 million people, and it’s right next to the cannon fire. And we have a good relationship with him. I have a good relationship with him. You know, when I say that, isn’t that terrible? They say. No, it’s not terrible. It’s great. It’s great. I have a relationship.(08:33)
President Obama said when I sat down that first meeting, right? In the White House. He said it was the biggest problem we had. North Korea. And you would have had a big problem, would have been a hell of a war. Tell you right now. You’d probably be in that war right now. So when I say that we got along and we’ve met, everyone says, oh, that’s so terrible. No, it’s a good thing. It’s a good thing. Not a bad thing. It’s a good thing. Doesn’t mean bad things don’t happen, but it’s a good thing.(09:02)
There’s only one thing standing between your family and the radical left wing mob, and that’s your vote this November. This is a very important … I feel like I’m a wall. You know, we built the wall on the Southern border. We’re going to have 300 miles by two weeks from now, even less, 300 miles. And by the end of the year, we’ll be up to almost 500 miles, and then we’re going to go on a little bit further, some areas that are loose, a little bit loose. We found out. We’re going to put a little bit more, about 536 miles going up at a record clip. It’s doing phenomenally well.(09:39)
If you want mobs and criminals, you got to vote Democrat. Look, because that’s what it’s about. They don’t talk about law and order. Now, I’m bringing it up now, but they haven’t, I haven’t seen anybody get up … I got just the other day endorsed by all the sheriffs of Florida, all the law enforcement. I got endorsed by Pennsylvania. I got endorsed by Texas, by Ohio. I think everybody, I don’t know. How can you endorse somebody else? How could law enforcement endorse somebody else?(10:13)
We gave all of our ex-army equipment. We have tremendous surplus equipment, and it was sitting in warehouses all over the United States. Hundreds of millions of dollars, I distributed it to the police, whereas Biden and Obama, they didn’t want to do that because they said, no, no, no. It makes the police look too strong. I want the police to look strong. You got to look strong. And a lot of it was protective equipment.(10:40)
If you want jobs and you want a lot of police and you want a lack of crime, if you take away New York and Chicago and some of these terrible cities that you see about with the crime, the crime is so bad. I left New York four years ago, and I could see, because he’s a terrible mayor, I could see there were things that were happening that were bad. He’s no Rudy Giuliani, I can tell you that. But I could see things were happening. But the last six months, seven months, it just exploded. It’s incredible. Crime up 368%, 368%. It’s crazy. It’s crazy.(11:20)
But if you want law and order, and I can say it, sometimes they’ll say, sir, say it gently. People want to hear gentle. They don’t want, say it gently. Don’t say law and order. Say, if you’d like law and order and safety. Nah, I can’t do that. If you want law and order, you’ve got to have law and order. You can’t have what’s happening in Portland. Did you see the kid get whacked the other day? Just whacked, like he was a piece of garbage? I mean, who could take it? We don’t want that, and pretty soon we’re going to have to send in our people because we’re supposed to wait to request?(11:53)
Now, I don’t know if they’re embarrassed or what, but these Democrat cities, they’re out of control. They have none. Look at Seattle, where she said, no, we want a summer of love. I mean, this woman is crazy, and they would have never taken back Seattle except they knew we were going in the next day. That’s the only reason they even did it. So tonight we have slow Joe will speak at the Democrat Convention, and I’m sure that he’ll just knock them dead.(12:23)
And he’ll remind us that he was born in Scranton. But you know, he left like 70 years ago, right? He left a long time ago. He wasn’t one … I view it differently. He’d say he was born here, but he left when he was like eight, nine, or 10. So he left, 68 years ago, he left. Long time ago. So I view it differently. He wasn’t born here. He abandoned Scranton. Okay? His family had something to do with that. You know, his parents. But he loves Scranton. I mean, he keeps talking about, I was born in Scranton. I lived in Scranton. Yeah, for a few years, and then he left for another state. You know the state. But this Scranton stuff. That’s why I figured I’d come here and explain to you one thing. But I think you people know it better than I do. He left! He abandoned Pennsylvania. He abandoned Scranton. He was here for a short period of time and he didn’t even know it. And today it’s amazing. It goes around in a circle. He still doesn’t know it.(13:24)
But he spent the last half century in Washington selling out our country and ripping off our jobs and letting other countries steal our jobs, Mexico, China, all of them stealing our jobs. He’s been there for 47 years, and now he’s going to come in and make a change. I don’t think so. His son who walked out with $1.5 billion to manage. That’s billions of dollars a year, and the son didn’t even have a job before that. And I asked the Wall Street people, tell me, is that possible? Smartest people, top people on Wall Street. They say, can’t happen. It can’t happen. The smartest people, the people that do get money from every country, from everybody, they say can’t happen. He walked out of there in 10 minutes with $1.5 billion. You explain that one, right?(14:11)
And then if they want to look at him, nobody looks at him. Nobody looks at Ukraine. He gets 83,000 a month and a $3 million upfront payment because of his great expertise in energy. But he had none. And he even admitted, no, I don’t know anything about energy. But he goes onto an energy company. It’s millions of dollars, 83, it’s actually double that because it was him and some guy that knew less than he did. And is that okay? Yeah? Is it okay when Joe Biden goes and says, a billion dollars, you’re not getting it unless you get rid of those prosecutors. You talk about quid pro quo, right? That’s your quid pro quo. And they did, quid pro quo. Right? And they did, they got rid of the prosecutors. And then he’s called. He says, now you’re getting your money. Okay?(15:02)
Figure this. How about if that’s a Republican doing that, what happens to that republican? It’s over. It’s a disgrace. But it’s changing slowly, too slowly, as far as I’m concerned. Joe Biden is no friend of Pennsylvania. He’s actually, for the reasons we just said, he’s your worst nightmare. Biden supported every single globalist attack on Pennsylvania workers, NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which built China into a power, TPP, Korea, the horrible, ridiculous Paris Climate Accord, which stripped our nation of its energy, and the so-called Clean Power Plan. The only good thing about it was the name. It was a horrible, unfair deal, horrible for you and horrible for Pennsylvania. They want to take your power away. You know what your power is? Your power is the billions of dollars you make in going deep into the earth and taking out-(16:03)
As you make on going deep into the earth and taking out what you have to take out. Everything you want, from fracking. You don’t realize how big a fracking state. Does anybody know how big fracking is? You’re not going to be allowed to frack anymore. You’re not going to be allowed. No oil, no nothing. No oil, no gas, no nothing. Just think of that. What would happen is, well, first of all, many of you, I guess 600,000, 670,000 lose their jobs. No money, no oil, higher taxes. Your stock market would crash. If they get in beyond fracking, if they get in, you’ll have your 401ks, which are setting records, by the way, stock market just hit a new high.(16:43)
And don’t forget, we’ve been going through this horrible plague from China. It just hit a new high. So think of that. It’s incredible. But your 401ks. How many people have 401ks here? Good. That’s a lot. That’s a lot. How about if they went down to like 10% of what they are now? Because that can happen. That can happen. And it will happen if we’re stupid and we don’t go out and vote and secure your ballot. Absentee ballots are good. But the stuff where they take millions and millions of ballots and send them all over the place, we’ll grab it and we’ll just put them in a big pile there. Everyone grab it. It’s a disgrace. Even common sense tells you that. Look at New York, look at what happened in New Jersey. Look at what happened in Virginia. Look at what happened. I won’t go through the details, you know the story.(17:33)
They have no control whatsoever. In New Jersey, 20% of the ballots were defective, fraudulent, 20%. And that’s because they did a good job. Okay? So this is just a way they’re trying to steal the election and everybody knows that. Because the only way they’re going to win is by a rigged election. I really believe that. I saw the crowd outside. For every sign we had for Trump Pence, every single sign. And that’s not that atypical in Texas. We had people on the highways, on the roadways, we’re driving to some oil well where we gave a speech. It was a 20 minute drive, between the plane and that oil well, there were tens of thousands of people and they had the signs, Trump and Trump Pence and flags, American flags.(18:28)
When the other side does show up, which is rarely, they never have an American flag. I can always tell if there’s a group of people. You never see an American flag. The fake news would tell you that. But you never see, but they don’t put it down, they’ll tell you that personally, but they won’t write it. But you never see an American flag. It’s an amazing thing. But if you look outside today, is it a hundred to one, 200 to one? And then you’ll read tomorrow that Biden was well-represented. He wasn’t well, there were hardly anybody there.(18:58)
Every once in a while, I’d see a Biden that’d be waving to the people. I’d see Biden, I’d say, “Wow.” I waved to her anyway. Who cares? But was it a hundred to one? It’s just massive. And you’ll read tomorrow that he had a massive crowd also. Pennsylvania lost more than one in three manufacturing jobs after NAFTA and China’s entry into the WTO. And that was a vote and courtesy of sleepy Joe. Biden looked American labor into the eyes and took care of dues, their union endorsements and their votes. The unions, I mean the unions have to be more reasonable. They have to be more reasonable. And we love the unions. We love non-union. I’ve had it all. I built every building I built in New York was with unions and unions are fine.(19:47)
A lot of Republicans don’t want me to say that, but I’ll tell you, unions are fine. Tell them to keep their dues down, please. But they’re fine. And you have unions here. You have non-unions. What I talk about is the worker. They treated our workers horribly. We lost our jobs to foreign lands. Our workers got fired, whether they were in the unions or not. Then he sold out and he passed the Cadillac tax. You know what that is, on union healthcare plans? Attack their energy jobs and sent their factories to China. And now he’s back begging for their votes. And it’s like a custom, Democrats. Except with me. I came in, I got so many union votes. I get far more. I mean, you’ve seen it. A couple of people either lost their job or came very close, that were unbeatable, because they let it charge for the Democrats for crooked Hillary last time.(20:43)
They let her charge. And the people in the union didn’t want that. They didn’t want Hillary, they wanted Trump. And we had union revolts, we call them. They revolted. But these guys right here, are you all union people? I can tell. Are you union? It’s good, right? It’s fine. That’s fine. Look at that. You got a hand. Certain parts of the country, they wouldn’t be as happy, but that’s okay, right? And it’s great. But they were not happy. And you know what was happening? They were not happy when the bosses got endorsed by the Democrats. American labor will vote for Trump Pence in 2020. They’re all saying that. And this area is going to be an incredible area. This used to be all Democrat until I came along. Until I came along, this was Democrat. This was heavily union. It was Democrat. It was everything.(21:34)
But they liked Trump and I’m going to never let you down and they will let you down. They will let you down. First of all, the country will be let down because the country, you will see a crash like you’ve never seen before. And as good as those stock market numbers are, there’s a headwind. They headwind is that if he won, the market’s going to crash. The Green New Deal, all of the different things, socialized medicine, that’s what they want. It’s socialized medicine. No doctor, no plan. Obama lied about it 28 times. Do you remember he said, “You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan.” It wasn’t true. 28 different times, they have them. For the last four years, we’ve been reversing Biden’s betrayals and delivering historic wins. For the people of Pennsylvania, your state lost over 50,000 manufacturing jobs when Biden was vice president. In my first three years, Pennsylvania gained 14, 000 jobs, manufacturing, and going up at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. We’ll catch all of those jobs that were lost.(22:39)
They said manufacturing jobs will never come back. Remember, you need a magic wand. Where’s the magic wand? Well, we have the magic wand. My first week in office, I withdrew from the Trans-Pacific partnership. It would have been totally destructive to your jobs. It would have been a horror show. I withdrew from the one-sided Paris climate accord, which would have cost us so many billions of dollars. And all it would have done is made the competition even tougher all over the world. I believe it was designed to hurt the United States and to get jobs away from us and companies. I stood up to China’s rampant cheating, plunder, and theft. I repealed that horrible tax. So many taxes. How many taxes did I repeal? I’m getting a list of them now, I’ll have it for you for the next meeting. Because I’ll be back to Pennsylvania, that I promise. And I’m standing up to the special interests and to big pharma. Weeks ago, I signed four historic directives to dramatically reduce the cost of prescription drugs.(23:45)
Think of it. You know what I did? I signed, as you know and as you’ve seen, I guess, but other countries have sometimes 10% of what we pay for the same exact pill, same drug, same prescription drug. And I signed a deal that we get, it’s not signed by the drug companies, they hate it. They’ll take in advertising. Whenever you see bad ads on me from drug companies, just remember one thing, that means your prices are coming down. That means your prices. But it’s called Favored Nations, Favored Nations. We were the least favorite nation in the whole world. We paid the highest price. So I signed if Germany has an example, pays 25 cents for a pill and we pay $3 for the exact same pill, we pay 25 cents also. Now what means is they’re going to go up, we’re going to come way down.(24:35)
We could drop drug prices by 50, 60 or 70%, at a level that has made them very angry. And rebates too, I ended rebates. Rebates go to you. Nobody else would have done that. They could have done that a long time ago. Biden could have done it. He didn’t know what it meant. But I will tell you, most people do know what, but they can’t do it because big pharma is the most powerful group. And I guess they say, number one, is it number one, mister? But you didn’t take any money from big pharma, right? I bet you didn’t. I’ll bet you didn’t, my man. I ended the NAFTA disaster and I signed USMCA in Deloitte. USMCA is phenomenal. And it’s going to keep your companies from moving to Mexico and other places. After years of building up other nations, we’re finally building up our nation and we are finally doing something that I’ve been talking about for years. We’re finally putting America first, and I’ve done that right from the beginning.(25:38)
We’re honored to be joined today by some incredible warriors that were really fantastic to me and friends of mine, but they really fight. These Pennsylvania people are fighters, in case you haven’t noticed. Representative Scott Perry. Scott, where’s Scott? Thank you, Scott. Great job, Scott. The warriors. Lloyd Smucker. Lloyd, thank you. Thank you, Lloyd. John Joyce. John, thank you. Great job. Great job. And a friend of mine and a great, great man. He would have been here forever if he decided to, but he decided maybe it was time to do something else. But this was a fighter like no other fighter. And those three other gentlemen will attest, right? Our friend Lou Barletta. Lou. And they’re shouting. I’m saying this for the media. They’re shouting “Lou”, they’re not booing. They’ll say, “He stood up and he got booed horribly. It was a horrible embarrassing.” No, that’s what they do. They’re fake. Thanks also to our congressional candidates, Jim Bognet. Jim, oh, look at him. I’ve heard good things, Jim. Is it easy out there on the stump?27:01)
Doing great. You’re going to win.(27:01)
Good, good. And you’re going to win, Jim. You’re going to win. And Lisa Scheller. Lisa, thank you very much. Great job. I hear you too are doing really good. If you have any problems, call Lou, he’ll help you. Let me also thank my campaign state chairwoman, Bernie Comfort. Where are you? Thank you very much Bernie. Thank you, Bernie. Great job you’re doing. How are we doing in Pennsylvania? Okay?t: (27:28)
Okay.(27:28)
I think so. I think so. If we don’t, they did a lot of manipulation. Also, a friend of mine for a long time and a great friend of his father and maybe his grandfather. I don’t even know. I hate to say that because it makes me sound a little bit older than I feel. I feel young. State GOP Chairman, Lawrence Tabas. What a great family. I miss Dan Tabas. You know that? Dan Tabas, what a great man he was. I don’t know if you know him, but he started out with about 2 cents and he ended up being a rich man. And he employed a lot of people and he was a real friend of mine. That was long before I ran for politics. He didn’t like many people, but he liked Trump. Right? People would go, “He’s a rough guy.” People would go up to him and say, “Hi, Dan. How you doing?” He became a very successful guy. And he’d look out and say, “I don’t want to talk to anybody. I just want to talk to Trump.” I like that kind of a guy, right?(28:25)
But he was a fantastic man, actually. He was a good man. Before the China virus invaded our shores, we built the greatest economy in history, nothing even close. We added seven million jobs nationwide, including 209,000 new jobs in Pennsylvania. By the way, in the last three months, right Bernie? Over nine million jobs, an all time record. This is now during and hopefully closing moments of the pandemic. You notice how they, anytime there’s a good country, they like to compare, because we’ve done an incredible job. You look at our mortality rates, you look at all the things. But they like to compare us to others. So they were talking about New Zealand. New Zealand, it’s over, it’s over for Zealand. Everything’s gone. They’re beautiful. They had a massive breakout yesterday. South Korea, it’s over, it’s over. Big breakout yesterday. It’s a tough deal.(29:24)
We’ve done a great job. We’re a big, big country. And maybe this is popular to say, maybe it’s not, I don’t care. Because based on the crowd outside, it looks to me like we’re going to win this thing. I think, by the way, by a lot. But your governor has you on a shut down like, what’s going on? How did they all get out there? And they were not socially distanced, I can tell you. We’ll have to. On the way back, they’ll still be there because they’re incredible people. But what is he doing? He’s got you in a shutdown, still. Shut down wolf. He can’t do this. He’s going to destroy your soul. What happens is depression, anxiety problems with family members, drugs, heart attacks, obesity. I mean, what is he doing? It’s more dangerous than the virus.(30:25)
He’s got to open this state up. You know when he’s going to open it up? No, I know what he’s doing. Because a lot of them are doing it, doing it in the great State of North Carolina, right? They’re doing it in North Carolina. But they’re doing it in a lot of different areas. They’ve got to open this state up and you have to do it, right? This wonderful, incredible Commonwealth. Right? I would call it a Commonwealth. Do you ever mind of they call it a state? No, call it Commonwealth. Whatever the hell you want to open it up. And what is he doing? What is he doing? So the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we’re going to get it open. And I know when he’s going to do it. You know when it is? November 4th. November 4th, he’s going to say, “Well, we’re going to open it up.”(31:14)
Then your results are no better than other states, by the way. It’s not like, “Oh gee, this is great.” Michigan has it closed down and North Carolina has a closed down, and this Commonwealth has a closed down. It’s a very sad thing to see. And the results are not good. The results, it’s not like, “Oh, this is wonderful.” The results in some of these places, as worse than those that are open. And you have other states. I mean, you look at the country, it’s really, we have states we’re thriving, we’re thriving. And there’s no shutdown. It’s enough. We shut it down because we had to, we didn’t know anything about what was happening. We shut it down. We learned a lot. Protect our seniors, et cetera, et cetera. You’ve all heard it.(32:03)
We learned a lot, protect our seniors, et cetera, et cetera. You’ve all heard it. But we learned a lot. Then we opened it up and now we have a big V. Remember they said the V will never happen? We have a big beautiful V. We enacted the largest financial relief package in American history. And through the Paycheck Protection Program, we saved nearly two million Pennsylvania jobs. We’ve also delivered nearly … That’s right. Two million jobs. We delivered nearly $11 billion in direct support to Pennsylvania families. And over the past three months, we’ve gained over nine million jobs. Nobody could even believe the numbers. And watch. The numbers will get better and better because we’re opening up.(32:45)
And frankly, the Democrats should do it. They should do what’s right for the country. They know they should open. Wolf knows he should open. He knows that. And how about his person with her mother, right? With her mother? Where the mother was protected, but the other people weren’t. You had a massive number of deaths in nursing homes, but 95 year old mother as I read. And I said, “Well, that person will be gone very quickly.” And that person is still there. I would say that’s something that if somebody ever wants to run for the governor of Pennsylvania, that would be something good to use. So they took the mother out of harm’s way and then moved her back when everything was okay. And nobody says anything about it? There’s no firing?(33:37)
Retail spending is now at an all time high. Who would have believed that? Auto production has gained 28%. Biden would terminate this unprecedented recovery. He wants to impose a permanent lockdown combined with a socialist takeover of the US economy. Did you hear him the other day? Lock it down. He wants to lock it down. So everything that we’ve gained over the last number of months, he wants to lock it down. No, we’re doing good. Florida’s going down substantially. Arizona, done a great job in Arizona. Texas going down. California is going down. They’d opened these states up and everybody wants to practice good hygiene. All of the different things. Do the masks. I mean, it’s just not going to hurt. Do them. Do them. You feel it, do them.(34:26)
But these things, these places have to be opened up. But November 4th, you’ll open. Don’t worry about it. But that’s a long time from now if you think about it, right? That’s a long time for now. In Biden’s policy manifesto written with socialist Bernie Sanders, Biden pledges to quickly outlaw American oil. He’s going to outlaw American oil, coal, American coal. He’s going to outlaw it. Natural gas, which is really an amazing form of energy, it clean, by mandating net zero carbon emissions from all homes and buildings within nine years and from all power plants by 2035. So he wants to basically get rid of all fossil fuels.(35:14)
And you know, I know everything about energy. I know so much about energy. Our new forms of alternative energy just aren’t powerful enough to power these massive plants and all of the things that are creating all of these jobs and all of this wealth for your state and for the country. This week in California, there were rolling blackouts because the radical Democrats have mandated impossible restrictions on energy production.(35:41)
And I see again, the forest fires are starting. They’re starting again in California. I said, “You got to clean your floors. You got to clean your forests.” They have many, many years of leaves and broken trees. And they’re like, so flammable. You touch them and it goes up. I’ve been telling them this now for three years, but they don’t want to listen. The environment, the environment. But they have massive fires again in California. Maybe we’re just going to have to make them pay for it because they don’t listen to us.(36:15)
We say, “You got to get rid of the leaves. You got to get rid of the debris. You got to get rid of the fallen trees.” You know when a tree falls, after 13 to 14 months, it becomes extremely dry. You look at some of these fires, they don’t really catch where the trees are growing because they’re wet. The water’s pouring up the tree. And they just don’t want to listen. They mocked us when I said that you got to clean your floors, just an expression. Clean the floors. And they have many, many years, decades of leaves, dry leaves. And that’s why they have it. There are other places, forest cities, they’re forests, they were developed in forests and they don’t have any problem, with more flammable trees than you have in California, but they just don’t want to do it.(37:04)
Senior citizens were forced to sit in their homes with no air conditioning in the middle of the summer and Biden wants to eliminate power plants all across America. You had a problem over here. But think of that, if they do that, get used to no air conditioning. They probably don’t want that either. Under my administration, we ended the war on American energy and I put the miners back to work. We put them back to work. The miners are back to work now. I approved the Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipelines almost right at the beginning. I just approved them right at the beginning and a lot of jobs. And by the way, it’s a much cleaner form of transportation.(37:55)
America is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Think of that one. To protect our great steelworkers … Do you have a couple of … Any steelworkers here by the way? To protect our great steelworkers, I placed tariffs on nations that were dumping cheap, foreign steel all over the place. And we have created an incredible industry out of nothing. It was ready to go out. Within months, steel imports dropped by 26% and American steel production surged by 18 million tons, almost immediately. Biden abandoned the steel industry and saved other industries that were worthless, but he didn’t save the steel industry. We saved the steel industry. You wouldn’t have a steel industry right now.(38:45)
When Joe Biden was vice president, the border was an open pipeline for criminals, gang members and cartels, flooding our schools with drugs. Under my administration, we ended the catch and release, horrible catch and release. You catch the criminal. You take their name. You say, “Is this right?” “We don’t have identification.” “Oh, that’s okay.” It’s like voting. They don’t want to have voter ID. Why? There’s only one reason the Democrats don’t want voter ID. You have ID for almost everything. You have your picture, everything nice, but not on a vote. Most important thing you can do is to vote. And voter ID, but they don’t want it. There’s only one reason they don’t want voter ID. And you know what that is, right? That’s really better. You guys all in favor, by the way, of voter ID? Everybody? If they weren’t, they wouldn’t be congressmen in good standing for very long. I’ll tell you that.(39:42)
We stopped asylum fraud and we deported 20,000 gang members and 423,000 criminal aliens. We got them the hell out of our country. But if Biden is elected, all of this security will quickly vanish. Control of the border will be seceded to violent cartels and the left wing crazies who empower them. And you used to see these massive amounts of illegals coming up from Honduras, from Guatemala, El Salvador. They’d come up and it’d be just thousands of them. You don’t see that anymore. Mexico is putting … They have right now. They have for months, 27,000 of their soldiers on our Southern border. You got to do it. You got to do it. Mexico has been really working with us very well. I have to tell you the new president of Mexico, now he’s not so new. He’s been there a little while. But the president of Mexico has done a great job as far as I’m concerned, from the standpoint of our relationship and our relationship with Mexico.(40:51)
In his joint manifesto with Bernie Sanders, Biden just called for a complete suspension of deportations, closing down detention facilities, ending border prosecutions. Think of this. Restoring and expanding catch and release, handing out free welfare to new arrivals, work permits for illegal crossers, and mass amnesty for all illegal aliens. Can you believe this? This is Bernie plus … I feel like Biden would be taken right. This is to show you how good a negotiate he is. Bernie took him left. It’s supposed to start and they’re supposed to meet a little bit left of center maybe, for them. For us it’s right of center. But Bernie actually took him left along with AOC plus three, right? AOC plus …(41:40)
It’s another beauty. She’s the designer of the Green New Deal. She knows nothing about the environment. She probably never studied … Ask her. How many hours have you taken on the environment?(41:53)
Biden wants to open your borders in the middle of the pandemic. Thank goodness we have that 300 miles of wall because you would have had a problem like you never would’ve seen before. I want strong borders and I want safe communities. If we don’t have borders … I was saying this from day one. If we don’t have borders, we don’t have a country. I imposed a travel ban on jihadist regions to keep terrorists out of our country. And it worked. And it got approved and the press said he failed. And they were right. The lower court failed. Your appeals court failed. And I won at the Supreme court. So they still say it failed because I lost it the first two courts. That’s how dishonest they are. They say he lost because I lost in the first two courts, but we won at the Supreme court. They forget to mention that fact.(42:44)
Joe Biden has pledged to remove this ban, opening the flood gates to terror and terror hotspots, and increasing the number of refugees allowed into our country by 700%. That’s the manifesto of AOC and Bernie. Joe Biden and Kamala. She’s another beauty. Also strongly support the deadly sanctuary cities that have been so bad for you and everybody else’s. District Attorney in San Francisco, Kamala put a drug dealing illegal alien into a job and jobs program instead of into prison. Four months later, the illegal alien robbed a 29 year old woman, mowed her down with an SUV, fracturing her skull and ruining her life. We believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.(43:44)
After eight long years, Joe Biden and Barack Obama left America weak, disrespected, and endangered. We are respected again. We are a respected country again. They said that one of the leaders called up, top top leader of one of the countries. He asked me to call President Erdogan of Turkey, who I get along with very well. He said, “Sir, please, would you do me a favor? Call Erdogan.” I said, “Why can’t you do it?” He says, “You’re the only one he respects. You’re the only person he respects.” I tell you this story. I like telling very personal stories. But they did say that. “You’re the only one he’ll listen to.” I said, “Is that because of the United States?” They said, “No, it’s because of you.” So that’s not so bad. I might as well. I might as well tell you the stories because they won’t.(44:38)
We’ve invested more than $2 trillion to rebuild our military. Our military is in the best shape it’s ever been and everything is made in the USA. And we revived the historic shipyard in a place called Philadelphia with hundreds and hundreds of new jobs. You know that. And we’ve just launched Space Force. I never talked about it on the campaign trail. Lou, right? I never talked about it. I’m the only one probably that ever ran for office in this country that’s achieved more than I said I would. I never talked about Space Force. I never talked about it. But I realized how important it was and we got it. A sixth branch. Think of that. Sixth branch. That’s a big deal. American rockets are once again sending American astronauts into space. We renewed NASA. It was a field of weeds. A field of weeds. President Obama closed it down. We’re not sending rockets up. And a lot of those rockets are paid by rich people. They like sending up rockets for whatever reason. They like it. I say, go ahead. You can pay us a little rent and you can use our property.(45:48)
We withdrew from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, a horror show. The ISIS caliphate was destroyed. The founder and leader of ISIS, the animal known as Al- Baghdadi is dead. The world’s number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, is dead. Joe Biden voted for the war in Iraq. I kept us out of new wars. Everyone said, “Oh, Trump, it’s his … He’ll be in a war his first week.” Instead of that, I got you out of wars. We’re down to a minimum number in Iraq. Afghanistan will be down very shortly to 4,000 troops and that’ll come back shortly too. Syria, we took them all out other than where we kept the oil if that’s okay with you. We kept the oil. We have some back and keeping the oil. We should have kept the oil in Iraq too. Remember, I used to say, “Keep the oil. Don’t go in.” I’d say, “Don’t go into Iraq.” But I was a civilian. Nobody cared. I was like you. So nobody cares.(46:50)
I want to get that mosquito out of here. I don’t like … They’ll say it’s cruelty to animals. I don’t know. No, it’s true. They were saying the other night, the shark. They were saying, “Oh, sharks. We have to protect them.” I said, “Wait a minute. Wait.” They actually want to remove all the seals in order to save the shark. I said, “Wait, don’t you have it the other way around?” That’s true. I’m not a big fan of sharks either. I don’t know how many votes am I going to lose? I have people calling me up, “Sir, we have a fund to save the shark. It’s called Save the Shark.” I say, “No thank you. I have other things I can contribute to.”(47:26)
I recognized Israel’s true capital, opened the American embassy in Jerusalem, and recognized Israel and its sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Nobody else. They talked about it for years. For years and years, many, many presidents talked about the capital of Israel, Jerusalem. And they never did it. I did it. And Golan Heights, 52 years, they’ve been meeting on Golan Heights. I did it. Last week we reached a historic breakthrough in the Middle East, finalizing a groundbreaking agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. People can-(48:03)
… Israel and the United Arab Emirates. People can’t even believe it. Even the New York Times gave us a great editorial. They can’t even believe it. We passed veterans choice and veterans accountability for our great vets. Nobody’s done for the vets what I have. Nobody. Not even close. We love the vets. And federal workers who failed and mistreated our veterans now can be told, “You’re fired.” That’s accountability. We couldn’t fire them. We had sadists. We had thieves. We had some bad people. They let go of 9,000 people in the VA. They were bad people. They didn’t love our vets. Now they have to love our vets.(48:41)
In a second term in office we will create 10 million jobs in the next year. We will hire more police. We will ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in the rule of law, not the rule of that horrible mob that you get to watch on television. We will provide school choice in every home. We’re going to let you have school choice. That’s a very important thing. The Democrats don’t want anything to do with school choice. We will lower the price of prescription drugs as I said. We will build and expand our energy infrastructure to a level that is even greater than what we have right now, and when I said before we’re number one, we’re number one by a lot, nobody thought we’d ever be number one. And we are energy independent, which is very nice.(49:36)
As we’ve been doing, we will end our reliance on China and other countries for drugs and other things. We will make our critical drugs, medicines, and supplies, here in the United States. We will give tax credits to companies to bring jobs back to America, and if they don’t do it, we’ll put tariffs on those companies, and they’ll have to pay us a lot of money. So what are they going to do? They’re going to bring the jobs back.(50:03)
In every action, every moment, and every decision I’m fighting for you. I’m fighting for Pennsylvania. A lot of people got rich and got powerful at your expense. Now these same liberal hypocrites want to open up borders and let violent mobs rule the streets while they live in Waldorf compounds in communities. They want to defund police while hiring private security. They want to let rioters burn churches while jailing you for praying in your church. They want to abolish school choice while sending their children to the best private schools in the land. They want to cancel you. Totally cancel you. Take your job, turn your family against you for speaking your mind, while they indoctrinate your children with twisted, twisted, worldviews that nobody ever thought possible.(51:07)
You notice they’re not knocking down statues and monuments anymore because when I saw what was happening I took an old law and I signed a nice new executive order. Then I explained, “10 years, if you knock down a statue, federal statue, or monument.” They were all set to March on Washington. “We’re going to knock down some nice statues,” and then they said, “You know what? Let’s not march.” The march ended very quickly. There was no more marching. They said, “You know, 10 years that’s a long time.” That’s a long time to knock over a statue that many people love and many people don’t. There’s a way of getting it down. You do it through a legal process. It’ll go quickly if it’s right.(51:50)
Joe Biden is the candidate of these privileged liberal hypocrites who hold you and your values in disdain. But you can send them all a thundering message on election day by voting for Trump-Pence. Do we love our vice president too? Do we love our vice president? I’ll tell you, I watched Kamala last night and I said, “I’ll take Mike.” I’ll take Mike by a lot. He’s been a great vice president actually. Pennsylvania is the state that gave us the Declaration of Independence, Valley Forge, Gettysburg, and generations of American patriots. Just like you. You’re patriots. You love this country. That’s why you’re here. You’re sitting in this boiling, crazy hot, sun. But you’re smarter than me because with you it’s on the back of your head. With me, I’m going to go home and my wife is going to say, “What happened? You look like a lobster.” Look the sun. This is great.(52:56)
I want to look like Lou, nice and dark. Right Lou? But with Lou it’s a little easier I think. This is the state where workers got their hands dirty mining the coal and forging the steel that raised up the mightiest nation in the history of the world. We’re going to be stronger than ever before. Remember that. We are already. We are going to be stronger than ever before, and that’s happening right now. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and you know this. Look, together we’re taking back our country. But I was just thinking as I said “stronger”, they want to come in and raise your taxes.(53:39)
They want to come in and put regulations on all of your factories, and all of your jobs, and all of your personal things. You know, little things, and they laugh at it when I say it. The light bulb. Those new expensive light bulbs. I said, “What happened to the old ones? They’re better.” They said, “They were mandated out.” I said, “Why?” Nobody could explain why. I said, ” We’re letting them back. The light bulbs are back.” Dishwashers. They have dishwashers they don’t give you any water. They give you not enough water, so they’re lousy. So what do people do? They press the button again, and again. No water. I let them have lots of water.(54:14)
We just got back from Whirlpool in Ohio. They’re thriving now because of what I did to competition from other countries. I tariffed them, and Whirlpool now went from a company that was just about over to a company that’s thriving. Sink faucets, shower faucets. I won’t say the third element of the bathroom because they always just bring that up, so I won’t say that but you know what I’m talking about. They don’t allow water. You go into a new hotel. You turn on the water. There’s no water. I opened it up. I said they could have as much water.(54:46)
I mean does Pennsylvania have a problem with water? No. Yeah you have a problem with water. You have too much of it. Right? You have too much water. You got to get rid of it. So why are we having restrictors? They have restrictors on, so I took it off. These are little things. I tell you about them. A lot of people appreciate them. A lot of people don’t know about it. But now you could go out, buy a light bulb for a tiny fraction of the cost that’s better. Won’t last as long, but it’s better. It’s better light. Makes me look much better. That’s a very important, it’s a very important thing.(55:16)
But you can buy now faucets where water actually comes out, and so instead of having it like on for many times longer … Actually when I take a shower, I can have water hit my hair instead of drop, drop. It’s hard enough my hair without that. So now we can actually have water pouring out of our shower heads. Okay? So a lot of good things. We’ve done a lot of things that nobody talks about, nobody writes about, but it’s about quality of life, and I think the people really appreciate it. I really do. Not so easy to do. Not so easy to do. I don’t think anybody else could have done it. Nobody else would have thought to do things like that, but nobody else would have done it.(55:59)
We’re returning power to you the American people from Scranton to Easton. How’s Ernie doing? Good? Huh? How good is Ernie? Right? Right? Is he great? Ernie Holmes? He was heavyweight champ. Right? The champ.:16)
Larry. Larry. Larry.(56:16)
Larry. Larry. Sorry about that. I know another one named Ernie Holmes. Larry Holmes. Is he still in the area of-:24)
[inaudible 00:56:24].(56:25)
How good was Larry? Right? That was probably Muhammad Ali’s most dangerous fight. I’ve never seen anything like it. Mohammad would never go down, but Larry Holmes was a great champion and I know he loved Easton. He used to tell me that, “I want to invest my money in Easton.” I don’t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing. I hope he’s doing well, but he was one hell of a fighter.(56:50)
From Scranton to Easton, to Allentown, we’re going to fight for every job, every family, every neighborhood, and every vote. Together we’ll unite citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, as one people, one family, one glorious nation under God. That’s another word they don’t want you to say, God. You know that, right? Did you see they were doing something last night that was extremely basic, and always has had the word God in it, and they decided to take the word God out.(57:22)
But this is where they’re coming from. They’re coming to get you. This is where they’re coming from. And me, we, we’re the wall between the American dream and total insanity, and the destruction of the greatest country in the history of the world. We’re all that stands. We’re all that stands, and a typical Republican probably wouldn’t get there but I think I’m very Republican in many ways, but your typical Republican would not be able to win.(57:58)
Like your area. This has always been a Democrat area, and yet the votes for Trump here are through the roof. You know how successful we were four years ago. Incredible. It’s a great area. These are great people. They’re great, hardworking, incredible people, and we love them. With your drive and devotion we will win a historic victory on November 3rd, and we will make America greater than it’s ever been before. I just want to thank the people of Scranton, the lack of home, okay, the lack of home for Joe Biden.(58:35)
Remember the next time. We’ve got to stop him from saying these things. But you look at … He’s going to make a speech tonight. It’s going to be very interesting to see how he does, and I hope he does well. I’ll be honest. I do. I hope he does well. I really hope he does well, but I also want him to tell the truth. He’s got to tell the truth about things, and he’s going to do a lot better if he does, but hopefully not well enough. Right now we are leading a war that’s incredible. But right now we’re leading in so many polls that they refuse to put out. We’re doing so good in this state, in North Carolina, in Florida, in Texas, in Ohio, in Michigan. You know how many car plants are being built or expanded in Michigan? We’re doing fantastically in Michigan. We’re doing great in New Hampshire.(59:26)
These are real polls. These aren’t suppression polls. These aren’t polls where they do registered voters. Registered. No. You want to do voters that are going to vote. Registered voters. You want to do what’s called likely voters. Likely. In other words, people that are likely to vote. Not registered voters, many of whom have died, many of whom aren’t going to vote, and then you want to do an even count. You don’t want to do many more Democrats. They do a poll. Right? Many, many Democrats, few, few Republicans. Trump is down by six, and then you look and you say, “Well, if that poll is true, we’re up by 10.” So we’re going to see. You’re going to see. They did it last time. They had me losing every swing state. I think they had me losing like nine states that I won. But he’s going to lose. Right?(01:00:11)
You were the first one that told me Lou. He’s going to lose seven swing states. He’s going to lose them all. He’s down by 14. Washington Post-ABC, they had me down one week before the election 12 to 14 points. The day of the election, because we complained that it was a fake poll, so they changed it the day of the election, and they had us just about even. Remember that whole big deal? We said, “You can’t say we’re down because that’s called suppression.” Then you say, “Hey, I love Trump, but I can’t vote for him because I don’t have the time because he’s not going to win.” But if you would have gone out and voted, we would have won. The problem was last time for them, 2016, everybody went out and voted. There was no suppression. There was incredible exhilaration except on the other side that they would not … You ever see those pictures of the craziness going on? But the polls were fake. Just like their stories are fake. Just like the news is fake.(01:01:08)
The polls are even worse, and we’re now actually doing worse. One of the most accurate polls was Rasmussen, and Rasmussen came out today. Did you see it? 51 for Trump, 51. I think they were one of the three most accurate polls and the ones that are telling the truth. Sometimes, I mean they have a poll that came out recently that was very favorable, they refused to release it. They didn’t want the people to see it. What kind of stuff is this? That’s why you’re going to do a great job. Right? You’re going to make sure this stuff doesn’t happen, but we’re going to make sure too. So we’re going to win this, and I think we’re going to win it really big. When you see those people outside, and I mean you can take this crowd and multiply it times …(01:01:51)
It looks like a hundred. Right? You can multiply it times a hundred, but when you see this crowd, and when you see the kind of enthusiasm, there’s nothing like it. We’re leading by the way, even they admit, we’re leading by enthusiasm by numbers like they’ve never seen before, record numbers. Meaning we have record enthusiasm, and he has a record lack of enthusiasm, and that is a big, big factor. So I just want to thank all of the people from this incredible place. I mean it’s just a great, a great, great place. I’ve been here for so long and so much, and I love it, and I love the people. We’re going to have the biggest victory. We’re going to have a victory that will equal or surpass what we did in 2016. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much. Thank you."

Secretary of Homeland security, Chad Wolf, FEMA administrator, Pete Gayner, and all of the people, state local leaders, they join us today and we’re having a separate news conference a little bit later on some other subjects. And I just want to thank everybody. It’s been pretty amazing. In August, I approved a major disaster declaration for California. I’ve approved… I think Gavin about 40 Stafford Act declarations. So very quickly because we want to get this thing taken care of, including fire management, assistant grants, to help multiple states stop the fires. More than 28,000 firefighters and first responders are combating the fires in California, Oregon, and Washington. Over 230 soldiers are fighting the August complex fire, and that’s the largest fire in California. That’s the big one. That’s the biggest. And we want to thank all of the brave fighters. We want to thank these incredible people, the first responders, service members who are racing to the extreme peril really, their lives in extreme danger.(01:06)
Soon after the event, I’ll present the distinguished flying cross to seven military heroes who recently brave raging fire and suffocating smoke to save lives. So we have seven people that were recommended very strongly by your representatives, and we’re going to give them a very nice medal, very important medal. A US medal that’s very powerful, very important. So I know you like that. Together, we’ll keep the people safe. I want to thank the governor for the job he’s done. We’ve had great coordination, great relationship. I know we come from different sides of the planet, but we actually have a very good relationship. Good man. And governor, would you like to say something? (06:13)
Absolutely. (06:14)
Chad, please."
trump_conference_sept16.txt,"(04:30)
Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. Good afternoon, Hurricane Sally made landfall, as you know, in Alabama and Florida last night as a category two hurricane and has caused 35 inches of rainfall in some places, that’s a lot. We have hundreds of FEMA, Coast Guard. We have the National Guard personnel on the ground assisting in response to the efforts and Alabama is in great shape. And every place that we are working with the state governments, really in great shape. We are working very hard on that, but it looks like it’s going to be mostly safe, but just follow the instructions of all of your local and federal people there. We have the best people that you can have. So I want to thank everybody. I want to thank everybody for working so hard in Florida, and they’re very good at this. The people in Florida handle it, they know how to handle it and the people working there know how to handle it. The governors have all been spoken to, and it’s a combination of real spirit and they have a tremendous esprit de corps. They have a tremendous sense of working on hurricanes. They’ve gotten very good at it. We’ve certainly had plenty of, even since I’ve been here, we’ve had a lot of them. So that’s in good shape, hurricane Sally. We’re going to talk about Big 10 football, but that’s a terrific thing. We’ll discuss that at the end.(05:57)
I just want to go into the vaccine distribution. Today, my administration released our detailed national vaccine distribution plan, and that includes a plan to ensure that we swiftly deliver the vaccine directly to America’s senior citizens in nursing homes. And it’s all set. We have our military lined up, everybody’s lined up and we think that’s going to go very nicely. We’re very close to that vaccine, as you know, and I think closer than most people want to say, or certainly closer than most people understand. To get the vaccine into the hands of American people, we’re fully mobilizing the awesome power of American industry and also our military. This is the largest, fastest, and most advanced vaccine distribution effort in American history by far. I was reading where Biden was saying that, oh, he’s going to have a plan. They did so bad on swine flu. You wouldn’t even believe it. Take a look at their record on swine flu. In fact, the person that headed it up said it was a total disaster.(06:56)
We’re on track to deliver and distribute the vaccine in a very, very safe and effective manner. We think we can start sometime in October. So as soon as it is announced, we’ll be able to start. That’ll be from mid-October on, that may be a little bit later than that, but we’ll be all set. So as soon as it’s given the go ahead, they’re doing trials as you know, and as soon as it’s given the go ahead, we will get it out, defeat the virus. We’ve manufactured all of the necessary supplies, so that as soon as the FDA approves the vaccine, and as you know, we’re very close to that, we’ll be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020 and a large number much sooner than that.(07:44)
I’m calling on Biden to stop promoting his anti-vaccine theories because all they’re doing is hurting the importance of what we’re doing. And I know that if they were in this position, they’d be saying how wonderful it is. They’re recklessly endangering lives, you can’t do that. And again, this is really a case that they just started talking a little bit negatively and that’s only because they know we have it, or we will soon have it. And the answer to that is very soon. The case updates, it’s very interesting to see what’s happening because the test positivity rate is down among all age groups and has fallen below 5% for the first time since this whole nightmare of the China virus began. So it’s fallen below 5%. The number of hospitalized patients has decreased by 43% from mid-July, 43%. Nationally people sick with the China virus now make up only 1.5% of all emergency room visits. So we’re down to the lowest number we’ve had. 1.5% of emergency room visits is for the China virus. And thanks to our life saving therapies and treatments, I think this is the best of all in terms of our great percentages and all the progress we’ve made.(09:08)
The fatality rate has fallen 85% since April, 85% fatality rate. If you look at what we’ve done and all of the lives that we’ve saved, and I’m going to ask that a graph we put up and now it’s up. This was right at the beginning, this was our prediction that if we do a really good job, we’ll be at about a hundred and 100,000 to 240,000 deaths. And we’re below that substantially and we’ll see what comes out, but that would be if we did a good job, if the not so good job was done, you’d be between 1.5 million, I remember these numbers so well, and 2.2 million. That’s quite a difference. So we’re down in this [inaudible 00:09:53] and that’s despite the fact that the blue states had tremendous death rates. If you take the blue states out, were at a level that I don’t think anybody in the world would be at. we’re really at a very low level, but some of the states, they were blue states and blue state management. By the way, we would recommend they open up their states. I think it’s very important that they open up their states because if you look at certain of them, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, we have to get those states open. It’s hurting people. It’s hurting people far more than the disease itself. So we would recommend that you open them, let you people have freedom, and it’s unfair to your people to keep them closed at this stage. We know the vaccines are coming, but we know the problem, we understand who the vulnerable are, which is primarily people with medical problems, but in particular, people with medical problems that are older. So open up your states.(10:58)
To facilitate routine testing of the nursing home residents and staff we’ve delivered rapid testing devices to all 13,850 certified nursing homes nationwide. So you have 13,850 certified nursing homes nationwide, and they are being facilitated in terms of testing and testing apparatus. Everything is there. We also have new tests coming and we have one in particular that I think I showed last night, which is literally two pieces of very fine cardboard. It’s actually a lot of delicate things going on inside that cardboard, but it’s an incredible test. It’s very quick, it’s very accurate and moves along rapidly.(11:46)
We bought millions of those tests and they’re going to be distributed rapidly. So the testing process where there’s nobody in the world that has a testing process like ours, in addition to being a number one. Number two, which is India, is close to 50 million tests behind us, I believe, Scott. 50 million. They have 1.5 billion people. Tomorrow, Vice President Pence will be announcing the findings of the nursing home commission to continue protecting our most vulnerable, which is our senior citizens and we’re going to take good care of them. I want to congratulate Big 10 football. It’s back. And I want to, in particular, I’ve been dealing with him, thank Commissioner Kevin Warren, for the great job he did. We’ve been working with him for a while. There was a rumor being spread that I didn’t want football back and it was just the opposite. That was another disinformation rumor were put out by the Biden campaign and it was just the opposite, but it really spurred me into action.(12:49)
I called the commissioner a couple of weeks ago and we started really putting a lot of pressure on, frankly, because it was no reason for it not to come back. And Kevin went in and worked very hard. I want to thank the players, the coaches for working along and they wanted it very badly. The players and coaches in particular, the parents also. And Big 10 football just announced, as you know, that they’re scheduled. They announced a schedule and it’s going to be great, important to have. I want to recommend that the PAC 12 also get going, because there’s no reason why PAC 12, shouldn’t be playing now. And perhaps they’ll start with at least partially, I had recommended today to Kevin and others that maybe you want to start off with 25% of the stadium, or maybe you want to start off with empty, I don’t know. I think they could have fans go, frankly, but they want to be careful. They want to be safe and they will be safe.(13:43)
They’ve got a very good testing process for the players, coaches, families, et cetera. And so I just want to congratulate Big 10. It’s going to be great. We’re going to love watching that. And again, I want to recommend PAC 12. You’re the only one now. Open up, open up PAC 12. Get going. Said the same thing to Big 10 and they did. And now I’m saying it to PAC 12. You have time. You really have time right now. Get going. I want to thank all of those wonderful coaches, some of whom I spoke with. And we went through a process over the last a couple of weeks, and I want to thank Congressman Anthony Gonzales of Ohio, who, as you know, was a great football player. Some people know that. I know that. But Anthony was a great player. Great receiver, went to the NFL. Also, I want to thank Tim Pataki of my staff. He worked very hard on this and he was up day and night working with Kevin and everybody else. So I want to thank Tim Pataki. Great job. So Big 10 is back and it’s going to have hopefully a great season.(14:49)
The census recently found that in the second quarter of 2020 Hispanic Americans home ownership reached a record all time high. That’s all time in the history of our country. Yesterday, the census reported that median income for Americans increased by an unprecedented $4,400 last year to a record of $68,700. In 2019 income inequality fell for the second straight year. The income gap widened under the Obama/Biden administration and it widened fairly substantially and it narrowed under the Trump administration. So there’s a little fact that you didn’t know, so it narrowed under us and it widened under Obama. Income grew more last year, we are alone than over the entire eight years of Obama/Biden. And that’s a big statement, but that’s the way it is.(15:43)
In 2019, 4.2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty. That’s the largest poverty reduction under any president in history. 4.2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty. The Hispanic-American poverty rate reached the lowest level ever history of our country. Hispanic American poverty rate, lowest level ever. I created the greatest and fairest economy in history, the biggest gains went to lower income Americans as they measure that kind of thing. We will be back to full strength very soon. We’re going to have a fantastic year next year. It’s looking like that. I think you’re going to have an incredible third quarter. The numbers are looking very, very strong for the third quarter. We have numbers that we’re going to put out tomorrow. Some of the individual things, car production, housing production, housing ownership, so many different things that are just at levels that nobody thought possible as we round the turn on the pandemic. the anti-police crusade from the Democrats and the radical left and radical left Democrats also, has to stop. The left wing war on cops puts our officers in danger and our communities at very grave risk. Can’t do this.(17:02)
Communities at very grave risk. Can’t do this. Biden described the police as the enemy. They’re not the enemy, they’re the friend. They’re our friend. They’re helping us. And if you go to… I just saw a poll, just came out or recently came out, where African Americans by 84%, wanted more police. They wanted safe neighborhoods. In Phoenix, last night, a federal officer was gunned down in a drive-by shooting. In L.A., this weekend, everybody saw that, this horrible human being, or whatever you might want to call him, [inaudible 00:00:36]. They’re looking all over, they’re trying to find him. We’re going to find out, we’re going to get them. But in L.A. this weekend, two Sheriff’s deputies were ambushed and viciously shot, and they can never be the same. They’re getting better, but they can never be the same. I’ll always stand by our heroes of law enforcement. And we want to stop this horrible rhetoric, and stop it fast.(18:04)
I want to ask Scott Atlas to say a couple of words, because I heard Biden talking to today about, he wants to come up with a distribution plan, a distribution for the vaccine that we came up with. A couple of things, we came up with that vaccine, it’ll be announced fairly soon. But regardless, this month, next month. In a level of time that nobody thought was possible because of what we did with our FDA, in terms of streamlining it. I want to thank Dr. Hahn. But what we’ve done with the streamlining has been incredible and very safely. Number one is safety, number two is speed. But you can have perfect safety and have much more speed. And that’s what we did. We did this for more than the vaccine having to do with the China virus, this was also for other things. So many other great drugs are out there, that would take 10, 12 years to get them approved. We’ve moved those schedules up a lot.(19:01)
But if this were Obama, Biden, this would have taken two, three years before you were at a stage where we are now at. So we’re going to be very soon. And it’s sort of funny to watch Joe Biden getting up and reading a teleprompter and saying how he would have done this. They had H1N1, he calls it the N1H1, it’s H1N1, it’s called the swine flu. And it was a disaster. And as I said, the person that ran it for him said the worst things about it. I mean, they didn’t know what they were doing, they quit. And they had no clue. And that was easy by comparison to this. This is the most contagious flu or virus that anybody’s seen. This is unbelievable how contagious it is. You found that out.(19:54)
But I watched a Biden quickly as he discussed without knowing a thing about a distribution plan. And he said that we don’t have a distribution plan, but we do indeed. There are military. We have military, we have everybody involved. It’s a great plan. And it’s a plan like no other. And we can start doing it. I believe the day that we come up with a vaccine, when it’s done, we’ll start that same day or the day after. Our military is very much involved. And they deploy troops. These are the generals that do logistics and all of those things. And we’ll have it all over the country. And then ultimately, hopefully we’ll be helping the world with the vaccine. And it’s very exciting, but maybe I’d ask Scott Atlas to come up and describe a little bit about that, the distribution plan in particular. Because Biden acted as though there was no distribution plan. And we’ve been working on this for months and it’s ready. And Scott has really taken a haul of it and done an incredible job. And please, Scott, thank you. (23:05)
Good. Thank you [inaudible 00:23:01]. Yeah, go ahead. (23:25)
No. I think he made a mistake when he said that. It’s just incorrect information. And I called him and he didn’t tell me that. And I think he got the message. Maybe confused, maybe it was stated incorrectly. No, we’re ready to go immediately, as the vaccine is announced. And it could be announced in October, could be announced a little bit after October. But once we go, we’re ready. As you know, Pfizer’s making this, they’re taking a tremendous financial risk and they’re spending billions of dollars on actually making this vaccine. They’re at a stage where they’re actually making it because they feel very confident as to the results. They’ll be announcing their results fairly soon. And no, that’s incorrect information. (24:11)
Yeah, I think so, but I don’t think he means that. I don’t think he… When he said it, I believe he was confused. I’m just telling you, we’re ready to go as soon as the vaccine happens. (24:23)
I would say that, yeah, we will start distributing it immediately. (24:29)
To the general public, very shortly there. I mean, really to the general public immediately. When we go, we go. We’re not looking to say, “Gee in six months, we’re going to start giving it to the general public.” No, we want to go immediately. No, it was an incorrect statement. I saw the statement, I called him. I said, “What did you mean by that?” And I think he just made a mistake. He just made a mistake. I think he misunderstood the question, probably. (24:59)
I think it would be very soon. I think our distribution process is going to go very quickly. I told you we’ve engaged the military. We have a General who’s in charge of all logistics, who delivers soldiers. He’s fantastic guy, supposed to be fantastic at what he does. And we figured that’s better than any company you’re going to hire. You can’t hire a company like that. And we look to do distribution immediately after we get the word that it’s good. And I think they’re having tremendous success with the vaccine itself. I think the results will be early and strong. The safety has to be 100% and we’re going to insist on that. And obviously the companies are going to insist on that. (25:41)
Scott, what would you think? (26:13)
Q1, he said. (27:15)
And you also have more than one company. You have Johnson & Johnson, you have Pfizer, you have Moderna, you have others. So we could conceivably have vaccines being given out by numerous companies. And they’re all world-class companies, they’re fantastic companies. That could happen also. Yeah. Please go ahead. (27:43)
Okay, they’re giving me studies on the deal, has to be a hundred percent as far as national security is concerned. And no, I’m not prepared to sign off on anything. I have to see the deal. We need security, especially after what we’ve seen with respect to China and what’s going on. We want security. So, I’ll let you know. They’re going to be reporting to me tomorrow morning and I will let you know. (28:07)
We’re going to see about that. Amazingly, I find that you’re not allowed to do that. You’re not allowed to accept… And I say, “What kind of a thing is this?” If they’re willing to make big payments to the government, they’re not allowed because there’s no legal path to doing that. And I’m saying, “Wait a minute, they’re willing to make a big payment to the government and we’re not allowed to take the money. When does this happen? How foolish can we be?” So we’re looking into that right now. You understand that? (28:36)
I said, “No, I want a big chunk of that money to go to the United States government because we made it possible. And the lawyers come back to me and they say, “Well, there’s no way of doing that.” You know why? Because nobody’s ever heard of that before. Nobody’s ever said that before. Nobody’s ever said, “Well, we’ll approve the deal, but we want a lot of money to go the government. Because by approving the deal, we’re making the deal valuable.” They’ve never heard of that before. Can you believe that? Right? Hard to believe. (29:18)
We’re going to find out about that. We’re looking into that from the standpoint of ByteDance, We don’t like that. I mean, just conceptually, I can tell you I don’t like that. That has not been told to me yet. That has been reported, but it hasn’t been told to me. It could be very accurate reporting for a change. So if that’s the case, I’m not going to be happy with that. Assuming that ByteDance is China, which I think it probably is. Yeah, in the back. (30:00)
The question was asked to me about, if you have violent demonstrations. Yes, we will put it down very, very quickly, if there is. Absolutely. (30:07)
And I think the American public wants to see that. Yeah. OEN please. OEN. (30:16)
Just a minute. If there’s any kind of demonstration or violence, there will be nothing that interferes with this product, this vote. There’s going to be nothing. The biggest problem we have right now, are the ballots. Millions of ballots going out, that’s the biggest problem. When you talk about other countries, whether it’s China, Russia, or many others that get mentioned. They’re in a much better position with these paper ballots to do something than they would ever be under the old system. And that’s our biggest problem. Our biggest threat to this election is governors from opposing parties, controlling ballots, millions of ballots. To me, that’s a much bigger threat than foreign countries. Because much of the stuff coming out about foreign countries turned out to be untrue.(31:02)
What is true, is that many elections have taken place over the last year and a half using this ballot system. They’ve been off by 5%, 10%, 15%. I think I read one at 40%, 40%. And these are small, easy to control elections. This whole ballot system, where you can send it in and it’s not even requested. We’re not talking about it solicited, they’re unsolicited ballots. And they’re sent in, is very dangerous for our country. And you know, who knows that better than anybody, the Democrats. Look at what happened in Manhattan, where they had this kind of an election. And it was so fraudulent that it should never have been allowed to be called.(31:48)
We could have five, 10, 15, 20% off. We could have more than that. The ballots will be stolen, who knows where they’re going, who knows where they’re coming from. It’s not just the counting of the ballots, which by the way, which will take forever. It’ll take forever. You think November 3rd, you might not have… I guess, at a certain point, it goes to Congress. At a certain point, it goes to Congress, you know that. This is a disgrace. This is being done on purpose. They know it’s no good. They know it’s going to be fraudulent. It’s going to be fraud all over the place. Who’s getting the ballots, who’s sending the balance. They have people saying you don’t need a verified signature. This is a serious threat to our democracy. And the Democrats know that.(32:33)
All we’re asking, if you solicit the ballot, you go through a process. You ask for a ballot because you can’t be there. For a large number of reasons, for whatever reasons. I’m doing it myself. I won’t be able to be in Florida. You solicit and they send it back. You do it and you send it back. That’s a process that you go through. And it’s pretty secure. I used the word pretty secure. I guess, nothing’s foolproof. But what’s pretty close to what… The most foolproof thing, the thing that really works, is you go to the ballot box. It’s going to be very safe. I think by that time COVID will be even lower. It’s going to be very low. It’s going to be a very safe process. We did it during World War I. We did it during World War II.(33:21)
The biggest threat to this election is these unsolicited ballots sent out by the millions. Controlled by governors, like in Nevada. Who is a political person, very political, far beyond being governor. Where they try to stop you from making the speech, unsuccessfully. But we had to move around a lot, had to move quickly. So, this same guy that tried to stop you from making free speech, outside, not inside, outside. They forced us inside because of what they did, but outside. This is the guy that’s controlling ballots. Then you look at Pennsylvania, you look at other places-(34:03)
Then you look at Pennsylvania, you look at other places, it is a big threat. And as far as China’s concerned and Russia, and they say North Korea, they say Iran, they say places, who knows, who knows, but they say all these different places, they can make forgeries of these ballots, they can do things that will blow your mind. And the Democrats know it’s wrong, they know it’s going to end up being a disaster. Just take a look at what’s happened over the last year with this same kind of thing, except in a very small setting with very few ballots going out, so that’s much easier, not 53 to 80 million going out, a very small number. And you know what’s happened? Fraud like you’ve never seen, missing ballots, ballots that never showed up ballots with bad signatures, ballots with no signatures.(34:54)
And in the case of Nevada, they don’t even want verification of the signature. It’s a disgrace. Now the hope for our nation is it’s before judges in Pennsylvania, it’s before judges in Nevada, it’s before judges and other places, it’s before federal judges. And hopefully they’ll do what they did the other day in Pennsylvania, where we had a great victory, open up your state, it’s unconstitutional to close it. Because what they were doing is closing it and closing it for political reasons. It’ll open on November 4th, it’ll open up right after the election. But they want our numbers to be as bad as possible, but the problem is our numbers are so good, with or without various states opening up, with or without. But we had a big legal victory, as you know, three days ago, a federal judge told them to open up their state, “It’s unconstitutional what you’re doing,” that’s in the case of Pennsylvania. Now the big cases are going to be the cases on these unsolicited ballots and we’ll see what happens.(35:56)
All right, OAN please. (36:28)
We don’t want to see that, we’ve been very strong on that. We’re getting reports in over the next two, three days, we’ll know very accurately what the story is and we’ll then take action, one way or the other. (36:49)
Well, I have real questions about it. Look, the US, we just won a $7.5 Billion dollar lawsuit, which nobody used to sue before I came along, or they used lose them every single time. Now they haven’t been losing them. But we’re getting reports on the WTO, it’s not good. Never been good to us. The WTO, as far as I’m concerned, was created to suck money and jobs out of the United States to the benefit of China and other countries, that’s what my opinion is. Whether it was created, or it just turned out to be that way. But the World Trade Organization has been not good for the United States. It’s been good for everybody else, but it’s not been good. It was a method, in my opinion, of taking advantage of the United States. So we’re looking into what happened and we’ll get back to you fast. (37:45)
I think he made a mistake, yeah. I didn’t go into any great depth. I was very surprised to hear it. It doesn’t really matter. Here’s what does matter, we’re all set to distributor immediately. As soon as that vaccine comes out, that’s safe and good and works, whether it’s Pfizer, Johnson&Johnson or anybody else, we are ready to distribute it very rapidly. As Scott said, and as our team knows and they’re ready, and it could be in October, sometime in October, or November. I don’t think it’s going to be much later than that, but I think it could be sometime in October. We’re ready to move and it will be a very full distribution. (38:26)
No, I didn’t tell him anything. I said, “What happened?” And I got the impression that he didn’t realize he said what he might’ve said. I didn’t see him say it, but if that’s what he said, it’s a mistake because we’re so ready. We’re ready to distribute immediately to a vast section of our country. And then beyond, because we want to help other countries also. But we’re ready to distribute immediately. (39:11)
Kaitlan, we’re focused on high risk, but we’re going to focus also on general public very much. But our immediate aim is elderly people and especially elderly people with heart, diabetes problems. But we will have it… we’re not looking at a small distribution program, we’re looking at distributing to the whole United States with an immediate focus of the elderly.(39:36)
Now, under no circumstance will it be as late as the doctor said. But I think that, frankly, if they hit him with that question, he said that, we are ready at a much faster level than what he said. We will have rapid distribution. We’re set up, our military and others are set up to do it. And we think it could even start taking place in October, but certainly during November, December would be the latest because based on what I’m hearing results are very good. So we’ll see what happens. (40:25)
Well, what I was saying to him… No, but that was a long time ago when I said that, we weren’t set up at that time. (40:30)
Well, how many months ago? When was the statement made? (40:33)
His book is sort of obsolete because the book comes out… By the way I read the book last night very rapidly because it was very boring. I read it and if you see what I said, I said a lot of really good things. I mean, for the most part, people like to turn it around, but I said really good things in that book. And as an example, he doesn’t cover I told him what we’re doing in the Middle East, and we’re doing it in an entirely different way and that’s not covered in his book. The whole thing is not covered in his book.(41:01)
And one thing I will say, and I respect the press for this one, which was interesting, almost universally, we’ve been praised for the deal that we made yesterday with Israel and with the two very important countries in the Middle East. And UAE in particular, where it’s a very powerful group, it’s a warrior country, it’s led by a great warrior and a man who’s highly respected. And if you take a look at that and Bahrain and Israel making a deal, and I will tell you, we have at least four or five others that want to come in. They would have come in yesterday, I talked to two of them yesterday and they’re ready to trot. And I think you’re going to have a whole level of peace without blood all over the sand. Nobody was shot, nobody was killed. We killed hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East. It’s all it’s been… I always say it’s the bloodiest sand anywhere in the world. And it didn’t have to be that way.(42:00)
The single worst decision our country ever made was to go into the Middle East. Not only the millions of people killed, and I include people on both sides, some people say, “Oh, you shouldn’t say that.” I said, “I’ll say it,” on both sides. Such a horrible thing was done. Such a horrible mistake was made. We’re doing this a different way. So we have those two countries. We have at least five that we’re negotiating with right now. And you can only negotiate with so many, I think they’re all going to come in. I think ultimately the Palestinians are going to come in. These are all the people that are funding them.(42:33)
I stopped funding the Palestinians fairly early on because they were saying bad things about our country. I said, “Well you mean, we’re giving them $750 million a year and they’re saying all bad things about our country?” So I stopped funding them very early on, but they get funded by other very rich countries, to them it’s like a spec, it’s nothing. But they get funded. But I think now that these countries, these very rich countries are a part of the deal and you’ll see, over the next fairly short period of time, other countries will come in.(43:05)
I think Saudi Arabia ultimately will come in too, I think getting Saudi Arabia will be great. But I think Saudi Arabia, this is my feeling, it’s not based on knowledge, other than a couple of conversations I had with the King. But Saudi Arabia I think will be coming in too and you’ll end up with peace in the Middle East. And nobody thought it could be done and nobody thought it could be done this way. I went to some very smart people. I went to some people in Middle East and they said, “You’ll never be able to do it, it’s not possible to make peace.” Well, now they’re saying to me, “Nobody ever thought of doing this. They all thought you make the deal first with the Palestinians. It had to be that way.” And I will say the resistance was some countries didn’t want to do it unless the Palestinians were there first, that was just a psychological thing, more than anything else. But they were wrong.(43:52)
The people, our great representatives that have been doing this for 35 years that were telling me how to do it, but they all failed. They were in Clinton’s Administration, they were in Bush, they were in Obama, all these great, brilliant people, they’re all telling me how to do it and I said they’re wrong and I guess I was right. (44:14)
And when you see… Well, let’s finish this. When you see the countries that will be coming, a very short period of time, not talking to a long period of time, all of the countries that will be coming in, just like you saw Bahrain yesterday and UAE and I can think of, I mean, at least five that are going to be quick and easy. Others will be quick and easy also, once the five come in. So you’re going to have something, you’re going to have peace in the Middle East.(44:42)
And we want to get out, our soldiers largely coming home. I said the endless wars, the ridiculous, endless wars. And I will say this, if I didn’t withdraw our country from that horrible Iran Nuclear Deal, that horrible, stupid deal where President Obama paid $150 billion for nothing and gave $1.8 billion in cash. 1.8 billion, you know what that is? 1.8 billion in cash, that’s more impressive than the $150 billion paid normally. But he gave all this money, all of these chips that we had, we had these chips and he gave them all away and we got nothing. And you know, it was a short term deal. It would be practically expiring now. Practically, it starts to expire actually right now, but it would practically be. And there is no way we will let Iran have a nuclear weapon, just to remember that, there’s no way that’s going to happen. (45:46)
Well, the vaccine, at the time, I thought it might take that period of time, but we’ve stepped it up very substantially. And now, I mean, I’m just telling this is just what it is, we’ve been able to step it up very, very rapidly. I never thought we could have a vaccine as quickly as we did, but I freed it up, I freed up the FDA, Dr. Hahn’s done a great job and they’re ready to approve something when they come in. The other thing that’s happening that’s very different is you look at a company like Pfizer, great company, really one of the great companies of the world, Johnson&Johnson, they’re all great companies, they’re doing a lot of testing at a very rapid rate that nobody’s ever seen anything like it. They’re in the third level of trial and I think that you’re going to see things that are amazing.(46:29)
When I made statements like that, that’s an old statement. When I made statements like that, I had no idea that we could produce as well as we’re producing. But only because of what I’ve done with the FDA and other things can we come up with numbers like that. We’re lucky that we don’t have to, because that was considered fast. If this were an administration from the past, and I think I can say far beyond Obama, it was other administrations also, you wouldn’t have a vaccine for two and a half, three years, and we’re going to have a vaccine within, at most, a couple of months. Okay? (47:15)
Something like that, yeah. I like the larger amount, I’ve said that, some of the Republicans disagree, but I think I can convince them to go along with it, because I like the larger number. I want to see people get money, it wasn’t their fault that this happened, it was China’s fault. You know? People say, “Well, maybe you shouldn’t say that, that’s not nice.” It was China’s fault. So I would like to see the larger number, yeah. I would like to see it.(47:41)
There’s some things I disagree with, but I’m sure they can be negotiating. Now, I heard Nancy Pelosi said she doesn’t want to leave until we have an agreement. She’s come a long way, that’s great. If she said that, she’s come a long way. I agree with her, we should have an agreement, people should be helped and they should be helped as rapidly as possible. And I think it’s going to happen, I think it’s very important. So the Problem Solvers came up with, it’s a group of people in Congress, as you know, you know them all, I know them all, they’re very good people, I guess you’d consider them dead center. But in many cases they’re not, they’re left they’re right, but they came up with this idea and I think they’re well on their way to suggesting some pretty good things. Yeah, I agree with a lot of it. (48:27)
I think the things I don’t agree, we can probably negotiate. But I think we’ve made some progress over the last week and I think it was positive that they came out with that report. (48:40)
Well, not that proposal, but we’re getting closer. We’re getting closer. I do like a lot of money getting sent to people that really were hurt unnecessarily by China because they could have stopped it. They stopped it from going into their country, they could have stopped it from coming to our country and from going to Europe and from going to the rest of the world, 188 different countries from all over the world. Please? (49:20)
And to masks. (49:28)
Okay. Number one, it’s not more effective, by any means, than a vaccine. And I called him about that, those were the two things I discussed with him. And I believe that if you ask him, he would probably say that he didn’t understand the question, because I asked him those two questions, the one question which we covered, and the mask question… And I was inaccurately covered because I was on with George last night, George Stephanopoulos, and I enjoyed it, I think people enjoyed it, a lot of people said very good things about the show. I hope they did well, but they said a lot of good things about the show. But they always cut my sentences off, they cut it off on masks and masks have problems too. When I talked about the masks have to be handled very gently, very carefully. I see that in restaurants that people with masks and they’re playing around with their mask and their fingers are in their mask and then they’re serving with plates. I mean, I think there’s a lot of problems with masks. Now, vaccine is much more effective than the masks. And if we get the vaccine, we have added to the fact that our numbers are going way down, you see the numbers, I’m just reading your statistics that are from wherever they get them, but they’re very highly qualified statistics. But no, the mask is not as important as the vaccine. The mask perhaps helps you. Don’t forget a lot of people didn’t like the concept of masks, initially. Dr. Fauci didn’t like them and a lot of people didn’t. And I’m not knocking anybody because I understand both sides of the argument, but when I called up-(51:03)
Because I understand both sides of the argument. But when I called up Robert today, I said to him, “What’s with the mask?” He said, “I think I answered that question incorrectly.” I think maybe he had misunderstood it. I mean, he had two questions; maybe he misunderstood both of them. But the answer to the one, is it’s going to be a much faster distribution than he said. Maybe he’s not aware of the distribution process. It’s not really his thing as much as it would be, let’s say, mine. But the distribution is going to be much faster.(51:29)
As far as the mask is concerned, I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks. Because people have used the masks, but when I looked at that chart that we put up, if you look, if you do the good job, they had I guess 240,000. But if it worked out well… Now look, one death is too much. One death is too much. Should have never happened. But the lower level was at that 240,000, between a 100 and something and 240,000. As far as the mask is concerned, he made a mistake. (52:08)
No, they may be effective. And I wear them when I’m in a hospital or what I’m in a setting with a lot- (52:17)
Well, I’m tested, and I’m sometimes surprised when I see somebody sitting, like with Joe, Joe feels very safe in a mask. I don’t know, maybe he doesn’t want to expose his face. I don’t know what’s going on. He’ll be way away from people, nowhere near people. There’ll be nobody with him. He doesn’t draw any crowds. So have circles, these big circles, they’ll be way far away.(52:39)
There’s no reason for him to have masks on. We get tested. I’m tested. I have people tested. When people come into the oval office, it’s like a big deal. No matter who they are, the heads of countries, they all get tested. So I’m in a different position. And maybe if I wasn’t in that position, I’d be wearing it more. But I’ve worn masks. And especially, I like to wear them when I’m in a hospital. Not for me so much as for other people, okay? Thanks. (53:20)
Well, he didn’t say minorities, he said minorities and senior citizens. (53:55)
Well, I’ll go first, because I appreciate your question. And yeah, we’ve had a tremendous drop in poverty for all people in our nation, but in particular for African Americans. And that statistic came in, and it’s because the African American community, the black community, has had the lowest, the best employment numbers that we’ve ever had, both employment and unemployment, depending on how you want to define it. But we’ve had the best employment numbers we’ve ever had. Now, we had the greatest employment in the country ever, almost 160 million people. We’ve never been close to that number, but we were just six months ago. And yeah, I’m very proud of the numbers. African Americans, Hispanic Americans, they had the best numbers they’ve ever had by far, both employment and unemployment, depending on definition. Thank you very much for that question. Scott, do you want to answer that? (55:58)
I will say, this is a phenomena that only happened when they realized that we may very well have the vaccine prior to a certain very important date, namely, November 3rd. Once they heard that, the Democrats started, just to show you how bad the intention is, they started knocking the vaccine. Had nothing to do with the vaccine. It was totally made up. It’s all disinformation, just like they put an ad in about football, just like they put with respect to me. I’m the one that got football back, and I was always against them going out. It was ridiculous, that Big 10. And now, hopefully PAC 10 goes back. And I say that just like even worse, they put out a totally fake ad, totally made up story. It was a made up story by a third rate magazine, where the head guy I guess, the head person, I have no idea who he is, I don’t know him, but he’s friends with Obama and Clinton, so they made up this horrible story, and then they did ads.(56:54)
Well, they made up this story too. This story is very simple. They started knocking the vaccine, as soon as they heard that this actually may come out prior to election. Now it may or may not, but it’ll be within a matter of weeks. It’ll be within a matter of weeks from November. It’s ready to go, and it’s ready to for massive distribution to everybody, with a focus again on seniors.(57:17)
And I will say also, the historically black colleges and universities we are doing at my suggestion, because they have had a difficult problem. There we are doing more testing, and finer testing. We have our great apparatus there.(57:35)
But when you look at what we’ve done on testing in terms of the technology and the amount, it’s been really amazing. In fact, I think we’re going to crack a hundred million tests very soon in the very near future. We’re going to be cracking a hundred million tests.(57:47)
Now, what that does do is it shows up more cases. So if we didn’t test, we wouldn’t have cases. You would have no cases. Other countries, they don’t test, they don’t have cases. And then they say, “Oh, the United States.” But we’re proud of it, because it shows where there may be a problem, and it helps people. But we’re doing tremendous testing at the historically black colleges and universities. And that was a suggestion I made, and I think it’s a good suggestion. Yeah, please, go ahead. (58:32)
No, he’s contradicting himself. (58:34)
I think he misunderstood the questions. (58:38)
You know what I think? I think he misunderstood. I told you, I don’t have to go through this. I think he misunderstood the questions. But I’m telling you, here’s the bottom line. Distribution is going to be very rapid. He may not know that. Maybe he’s not aware of that. And maybe he’s not dealing with the military, et cetera, like I do. Distribution is going to be very rapid, and the vaccine’s going to be very powerful. It’s going to solve a tremendous problem. It’s going to be very powerful. (59:06)
Because of the great job we’ve done. Because of the great things we’ve done in other fields also. Because of the fact that we created ventilators, we built ventilators by the thousands, and now we’re supplying to the world. Because of all of the incredible work we’ve done for governors who are on every call saying, “This is incredible. This is great. This is great.” Sometimes they’re not quite as friendly at a news conference when you have people covering it. But we have done a phenomenal job on COVID-19, as they like to call it. I call it other things. But we have done a phenomenal job. I get calls from other people in other countries; they can’t believe the job we’ve done. And then they’ll say, “Is there any way that you could get us ventilators?” I say, “How many do you need?” “1000 ventilators.” I said, “We’ll be able to take care of it.” We’re making thousands of ventilators, very complex, very expensive, very difficult thing to make. We’re making thousands a month.(59:59)
The cupboard was bare when I got here, and I will tell you, our distribution is going to be very rapid, and it’s going to be all encompassing. We are going to have a focus on certain groups that have problems, senior citizens, et cetera, but it’s going to be a very powerful distribution. It’s going to cover everybody, and it’s going to cover them rapidly.(01:00:23)
I don’t know whether or not the doctor knows that, how much he covers, but I called him. Because I said, “Why did you say that long?” He wasn’t that aware of it. And the other one was the mask.(01:00:34)
The vaccine is going to have tremendous power. It’s going to be extremely strong. It’s going to be extremely successful. We’re not going to have a problem.(01:00:43)
And the mask may help, and I hope it helps, and I think it probably does. But again, the mask is a mixed bag. There are some people, professionals, Scott, you would know a lot of them, but there are some people that don’t like the mask because of the touchiness and the touching, and then you’re touching everything else. They feel that masks have problems. So anyway, go ahead, in the back, please. (01:01:10)
I do. I do. (01:01:12)
He I think maybe misunderstood a question. But we’re beyond that now. We’re really in final stages of vaccines. We’re getting ready to go phase one on distribution. And I think it might come out even sooner than you think. I think the vaccine’s going to be even better than people thought originally. I think people are going to be really surprised at the success of the vaccine. I think it’s going to be a tremendous success. And we’re fighting a very powerful party with a poor candidate, in my opinion. But we’re fighting a very, very powerful party and they’re partners with the media, and because they’re working together very closely. And when they hit on the vaccine, they only hit on it when they realized that, wow, this is amazing, they may have it even before the election. All of a sudden they didn’t like the vaccine so much. (01:02:09)
In the back please. (01:02:16)
I cannot hear you, I’m sorry. (01:02:23)
Today? (01:02:24)
Say it. (01:02:33)
Oh I see, about the staff? I heard about it this morning. At a very small level, yes, I heard about it this- (01:02:40)
I don’t know. We can have a report to you if you feel it’s necessary. Last night I heard about it for the first time, and it’s a small number of cases. Maybe it’s not even cases. Do you know, do you have any idea if there’s- (01:02:57)
Yeah, that’s okay. (01:03:03)
And it’s not anybody that was near me. From what I heard, a very small number. I think you can probably give the number out later on when you find out what it might be. One person? It was one person, okay? (01:03:16)
It was one person. So not a person that I was associated with. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you."
trump_conference_sept18.txt,"(00:08)
So a lot of work has been going on with respect to the vaccines, very successful work I might add. We have three great, great companies doing somewhat different variations but they’re all looking very good from the beginning of the China virus, all nations have understood that our top priority must be to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible to end the pandemic and get life back to normal. The successful vaccine will not only save millions of lives, it will put an end to the restrictions and some of the things that go on and have to go on in the meantime.(00:50)
Today I want to discuss the historic progress we are making to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in record time and there’s never been anything like this, ever. History there’s never been … In history, period, world history. Since January, America’s brilliant doctors and scientists have been working around the clock. These are the best medical minds in the world by far and the vaccines are going through the gold standard of clinical trials and very heavy emphasis placed on safety. Three vaccines are already in the final stage. Joe Biden’s anti-vaccine theories are putting a lot of lives at risk and they’re only doing it for political reasons. It’s very foolish. It’s part of their war to try and discredit the vaccine now that they know that we essentially have it, we’ll be announcing it fairly soon.(01:46)
As part of Operation Warp Speed, my administration is manufacturing all of the most promising vaccines in advance and actually it will be fairly long in advance. As soon as a vaccine is approved, the administration will deliver it to the American people immediately. Distribution will begin within 24 hours after notice and the general, I think those are the words specifically you wanted us to know. (02:16)
Within 24 hours, you’re also set to go and massive amounts will be delivered through our great military and the general is one of our best and he is ready to go. We’ll have manufactured at least 100 million vaccine doses before the end of the year and likely much more than that. Hundreds of millions of doses will be available every month and we expect to have enough vaccines for every American by April and again I’ll say that even at that later stage, delivery will go as fast as it comes they can deliver. They’re very good, best, I think probably the best in the world.(02:58)
The estimates I’m providing today are based on the manufacturing that’s in process and that’s in process immediately right now. We’ve already exceeded our ambitious goals under the Defense Production Act contracts that we’ve secured, we may even get far above these numbers, the numbers that I’m telling you today, I think we’ll exceed them very, very substantially and I think that also includes distribution. I think distribution will go even quicker than most people think, relying on our military. Everything I’ve done with our military has worked out very well. In a short time we’ll have a safe and effective vaccine and we’ll defeat the virus.(03:41)
Interestingly as I was saying that day, [inaudible 00:03:44] just like what we did with our military with respect to ISIS went very well. Long ahead of schedule. They have been incredible in working with me. Let’s go to Puerto Rico because Puerto Rico has been hit very, very hard by a lot of different storms and they’re great people. It’s a great place, I know it well. Great place. Today my administration is making the largest emergency relief award in history to rebuild Puerto Rico’s electrical grid and educational system. We’re awarding $13 billion to permanently repair and replace thousands of miles of transmission and distribution lines that should have been done many years ago. This was beyond even the storms, it was just age and a lot of the salt. The salt from that ocean is a killer for electrical stations and power generation systems but on top of the salt you had these massive storms or hurricanes come in and Maria in particular was a disaster but for many years they have been trying to get this done and they haven’t had the political willpower in Washington to get it done so we’re going to get it done for them.(05:00)
We’re also going to be bringing back very, very major amounts of medical work. [inaudible 00:05:06] pharmaceutical manufacturing at levels that few places had and a lot of it has lest Puerto Rico and w’re going to bring that back, especially now since our emphasis is going to be making our product so we’re going to bring pharmaceutical manufacturing back to Puerto Rico. A lot of it left over the years over a long period of time. It’s been leaving and going to China and other places so we’re bringing all of that back.(05:34)
This was done in previous administrations, I’d like to just point out. We’ve done more for Puerto Rico than anybody and this is just an example of it but we’ve done more for Puerto Rico by far than anybody. We’ll also be launching a major effort to repair and renovate the schools across the island following Hurricane Maria, my administration immediately deployed the full power of the federal government to bring the electric grid back online so they could at least temporarily and it certainly wasn’t a permanent fix, it was ripped to shreds but a lot of that was ripped to shreds long before even the storm came and for many, many years they’ve been trying to do it, but we wanted to restore water supplies and we did make emergency repairs to critical infrastructure which we took care of and save countless lives which we did.(06:24)
FEMA’s response in Puerto Rico included the longest sustained air mission supplying food and water to American history. We supplied it for long after the hurricane was gone, the largest disaster commodity distribution mission in U.S. history and the largest [inaudible 00:06:42] operation in federal disaster aid U.S. history. My administration has also pre-positioned vast quantities of relief supplies for the future disasters. Unfortunately Puerto Rico is in the way of a lot of different storms, a lot of hurricanes, and the island is now stocked with eight times as much drinking water and 13 times as much food as it had before I took over so they’re ready to go if something should happen. They got [inaudible 00:07:12] recently but they’re in a good position so we’re going to bring back medical distribution and manufacturing to Puerto Rico at a level far greater than it was before and it’s been emptied out. It’s been largely … Largely left the island for many years. At one point it was the talk of the world and now it’s the talk of the world in a different way. We’re bringing it back so we’re going to be bringing it back from various other parts of the world, it’s going to Puerto Rico and I think it’s going to be very exciting for the people and we’re undertaking the largest federal investment in Puerto Rico’s history. So you have a lot of … I have a lot of friends in Puerto Rico and I have told them about it. Asked them about it conceptually what do you think and they’re very excited. I just –(08:03)
… conceptually, what are you thinking, and they’re very excited. I just want to say, by contrast, Biden’s devastated the island of Puerto Rico. Joe Biden, what he’s done to Puerto Rico, meaning the past administration, is devastating. In 1996, Biden voted to eliminate a critical tax provision that had allowed Puerto Rico to become a dominant player in global pharmaceutical manufacturing. That’s what happened. When Biden voted to repeal this provision, the pharmaceutical industry was ripped out of Puerto Rico, all incentive to stay there was taken away and all of the jobs went to China, and other places, but mostly to China. That’s what happened. This was done with a vote of Biden, this was even before the Obama administration. This was early on, but so sad that that was done. Then Obama came in and it got worse. For the people of Puerto Rico, they were a disaster for you. I have to say, in a very nice way, a very respectful way, I’m the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico, nobody even close. But as a result, the island’s economy under the previously mentioned names, it just absolutely cratered. Biden’s vote also left the United States at the mercy of foreign suppliers for essential medicines, putting our national security and our health at risk. We had a tremendous industry potentially going to Puerto Rico and they just absolutely cut it short with bad votes and took all the incentive away and it went to other places, far away lands.(09:46)
They really, in a sense, were voting to destroy Puerto Rico. We’re bringing Puerto Rico back and we’ll have it done fairly quickly. The $13 billion, that’s a tremendous amount of money, but it’s a very important amount and I think you’re going to see something terrific. It’s very exciting, to me, what the most exciting is bringing the whole pharmaceutical industry back. We’ve spoken to various companies and they’re willing to go there. They want to have a little bit of help, but they’re willing to go to Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is going to be very exciting, what’s going to happen. They were on the verge of doing it and they took away all the incentives. I don’t know how that was allowed to happen, but they allowed it to happen. That was very, very bad for Puerto Rico and the people of Puerto Rico. That was done by Democrats and a Republican is bringing it back.(10:41)
With that, we can take a few questions and we are, again, very advanced on the vaccine. We think that sometime in the very near future we’ll have it. We’re, I would say, I think I can say, years ahead of schedule, what it would be if it were an administration other than this one. You would have been years before you ever had anything approved by the FDA.(11:05)
John, please. (11:14)
Because what we’re doing is we’ve been working on it for a long time to get it passed. Very tough to get things past Democrats, where they don’t want to see this happen. They probably certainly didn’t want to see it happen at this point, but it’s a big package, it’s a great package. I think the most exciting part of the package isn’t necessarily the billions of dollars, it’s going to be what we do with the pharmaceutical industry. We’re going to get them back into Puerto Rico. They liked being there but they changed the tax situation, they ripped it out. They really ripped apart the island and we’re going to bring it back, John. (11:56)
Yeah, I think that’s … Well, they can’t do anything. Look, the Biden/Harris campaign, what they did, they hurt … I’ve gone through it, and whether it was President Obama or Vice President Biden, they were a disaster for Puerto Rico, a disaster. What we’re doing, and what we’ve done, but what we’re doing is something that will be fantastic for many years in the future. Bringing back the pharmaceutical industry, manufacturing in Puerto Rico is what they’ve wanted for years and we’re doing that, in addition to the $13 billion.(12:29)
Yes, please. (12:50)
Sure, and I think we may exceed these numbers even. Scott, do you want to discuss that quickly? (14:10)
Definitely, yeah. We think we will. (14:13)
Yeah, that’s on the outer edge. We think we can beat that number very substantially. (14:29)
I think it could go quickly. We have great companies talking to us about it. You know about Oracle, Microsoft has been involved and let’s see whether or not they’re continuing to be involved. Walmart is truly a great company, they are very much involved. They want to do something. We have some great options and maybe we can keep a lot of people happy, but have the security that we need. We have to have the total security from China. We’re not going to do anything to jeopardize security. At the same time, it’s an amazing company, very, very popular. If we can do a combination of both I’d be very happy doing that. It could go very quickly. It could go very, very fast.(15:14)
Yeah, please. (15:14)
Go ahead, please. (15:19)
OAN. (15:45)
Well, they just left my office as you know, the Oval Office. We had a very good meeting with the Amir and I think we understand each other very well. They’re very excited about a lot of things that are happening in the Middle East. They are so excited that we signed the first two countries and I think they’ll-(16:03)
They are so excited that we signed the first two countries and I think they’ll end up fairly quickly being a part of it. I have, I would say seven or eight countries that want to be a part of it without even working very easily, very quickly. Nobody thought this would happen. Not only is it happening, it’s happening rather easily. We discussed that very briefly because that’s an easy one. Believe it or not, that whole thing is now a beautiful puzzle that’s coming together very nicely, but we are talking to them and others about various aspects of the Middle East. The Middle East is straightening out with all this happening. We’ve brought a lot of our troops back. A lot of them are coming back in the very near future. We’re out of Syria, other than we kept the oil. I kept the oil and we have troops guarding the oil.(16:46)
Other than that, we’re out of Syria. We took them off the border between Syria and Turkey. We had a lot of troops on the border. Ultimately we got it down to 50 and I thought they were in great danger. When you have two armies sitting there looking to fight and you have 50 people in the middle, I don’t care who you are, even if you’re the US, those 50 people are in great danger. We took them out, but we had a lot of troops on the border and we took them out. I said, “Look, they’ve been fighting on their border for 200 years and a lot longer than that, under different names, and they can continue to do that. That’s not for us. We’re guarding our own borders. We’re doing very well on our Southern border as an example. We’re out of Syria, except we kept the oil and we’ll make a determination. We’ll probably be dealing with the Kurds on the oil and see what it all ends up, but we’ll be out.(17:36)
Very importantly, we’re down to very few soldiers in Iraq and we’re down, we’ll be down very shortly over the next couple of weeks to 4,000, less than 4,000 in Afghanistan. Then, we’ll make that final determination little bit later. We’re dealing very well with the Taliban. They’re very tough. They’re very smart. They’re very sharp, but you know, it’s been 19 years and even they are tired of fighting, in all fairness. We really served as a police force, because if we wanted to do what we had to do, we would have fought a lot differently than they have over the 19 years. They didn’t fight it properly. They were police, okay? They’re not police. They’re soldiers. There’s a difference.(18:22)
The police, nobody has more respect for police than I do, but they have to do their own policing. We’re having some very good discussions with the Taliban, as you probably heard. It’s been public. But we’ll be down to, very shortly, we’ll be down to less than 4,000 soldiers. We’ll be out of there, knowing that certain things have to happen. Certain things have to be fulfilled, but 19 years is a long time. 8,000 miles away, 19 years is a long time. The Middle East, the whole Middle East equation, if you look at what’s happened, if you’ve looked at the stupidity of decisions that were made, including the deal that was made, I mean, take a look at what happened with Iran.(19:12)
Had that deal stayed, had I not broken that deal, you could have never done the deal that I’m doing now, where all the countries are pouring in. I had two calls this morning with countries that want to know, when can we go into the deal? They want to go. It’s not that we’re giving them anything. They want security. They want peace. They’re really tired of fighting. It’s incredible. They’re tired of fighting. They’ve been fighting for so many years, tired of fighting. Thank you very much, (19:52)
Well, that’s true. (19:53)
They have money. (20:00)
Because we’re building that up as a great medical, pharmaceutical manufacturing area where we’re going to be taking back a lot of the business that we let go for years and we’re going to bring it back. They were very good at it. They did a fantastic job, but they destroyed it with their tax policy. They made it impossible for people to stay. People went to China, mostly and other countries. Puerto Rico has been very corrupt in terms of its politicians. You see that. They’re one after another. It’s been unbelievably corrupt and we’re studying that and working on that.(20:34)
We think we have a good group of people who are working very well with the politicians right now. But I think more exciting than than the dollars, and you have to do something with respect to their grid. Their grid is a disaster. Their generators are wiped out and they’ve been wiped out for years, long before Maria came, they’ve been wiped out for years. If we can build Puerto Rico back into a pharmaceutical manufacturing area, we’re going to designate it as such, I think it will be unbelievable for Puerto Rico, unbelievable for the people of Puerto Rico, and we can make it very successful (21:34)
Oh, not all of them. Yeah. In many cases I do. I think we have a bigger problem with China than we have with Russia. I think China is a far bigger problem. I said, “Well, that’s okay if you want to think about Russia, but what about China?” I think that’s appropriate. I thought that the definition of Antifa was an absolutely incorrect definition, so I speak up. I like to speak up. I have fantastic people. That’s why we’re able to make these great trade deals. That’s why we’re able to do things like we’re doing today. That’s why the country has done so well.(22:08)
The country has done numbers like nobody … Had we not had the China plague come in, if that virus didn’t come in, the plague, I call it, the plague from China didn’t come in, the numbers we had were not only record setting, they were beyond anything anyone’s ever seen in any country, frankly. Now, we closed it up and now we’re opening it up. By the way, the Democrats ought to open up their states and they go to open them up fast, John. The faster, the better, because they’re hurting that people. A lot of damage done with these extended shutdowns, but we save millions of lives by doing it the way we did it. Now we’re opening it up and you see the kind of numbers, the manufacturing numbers, see the retail numbers.(22:51)
You look at the employment numbers, they’re setting records. It’s an incredible thing that’s happening. Had the plague not come in, we would have been right now at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. Nobody’s ever seen. But even before it was at the highest stock market, best unemployment numbers and employment numbers were up to 160 million people, just short of 160 million people employed. We were never close to a number like that, and now we’re doing it again. Next year we will have a great economic year, I think one of our best, yeah. (23:33)
I really don’t know. I don’t run it, to be honest. That’s run as you know, that’s run by a commission and they run it. I think frankly, if they would raise the price of packaging, you’d end up make it a lot of money or breaking even, or doing something. The Post Office has been a mess for many, many generations, but for certainly decades. It loses a lot of money. It’s always lost a lot of money, and one of the reasons it loses a lot of money now, is that it’s delivering all these-(24:03)
And one of the reasons it loses a lot of money now is that it’s delivering all these packages, and every time they deliver a package, they lose $3 a package, or whatever the number may be. So I would suggest that they raise the price of packages. And you might get something where it loses very little or maybe broke even or maybe even made some money. Can you imagine a thing like that? And whether it’s Amazon or any of the other internet delivery services, if you did that, you’d have a whole different Post Office. So hopefully, they’ll be doing that. In the meantime, I know so many people in the postal system, and I’ve known them over the years, they’re incredible people. And they’re very secure, they’re going to be very secure.(24:44)
The problem they have with the ballots, is not the Post Office. The problem they have with the ballots is the people sending the ballots, and the people counting the ballots. And who are they sending them to? Where are they being sent? Are they being sent to the wrong areas? Or they’re not being sent at all? There’ll be tremendous corruption if they don’t do something about it. Now, one big hope is that we’re in front of numerous federal judges. In Nevada, we’re in front. In Pennsylvania, as you know, we’re in front, in Michigan. We have numerous court cases out there that are very well advanced, and you’ll start seeing decisions. Just like we won the case on opening up Pennsylvania. That was a great decision by a judge that came down two days ago. And that was a very important decision. But we have a lot of very important decisions coming down on the scam of unsolicited ballots, where they’re sending out tens of millions of ballots to everybody. People that didn’t expect them. People are getting inundated with… they’ll be showered with ballots.(25:47)
Everybody in this room knows it’s a scam, everybody in this room, even John. Don’t say it, John- (25:56)
Because it’s a scam. Sending ballots at a level, [crosstalk 00:26:01] they are never going to be able to count them. Let me ask you- (26:07)
But that’s different, that’s called solicited. When you solicit, when you go out, it’s called absentee or solicit. When you go out and you request a ballot, you want to say, “I want to vote because I can’t be in Florida or I can’t be someplace,” you request. So you’re sending something in, it’s handled professionally. They send it back. It’s a whole thing. That’s much different than unsolicited, when you get millions of ballots. I heard numbers like 80 million ballots. Now, just this week, they had another one, another one of the disasters that took place, an election. But look at what happened in New Jersey. And they had another one in New Jersey, a very, very bad… different than Patterson. Look at what happened in New York with Carolyn… Congressman Murphy. (26:56)
Maloney, Carolyn Maloney. Look at that, look at that race. Carolyn Maloney had a race, it was a disaster. Ballots are missing, ballots of fraud. These are small races. Look at what happened in Virginia. Look at what happened at various other parts of the country, even over the last short period of while. And these aren’t 80 million or 50 million or 20 million votes, these are small elections. These are congressional elections where in theory it’s easy. So what’s going to happen on November 3rd when somebody is leading, and they said, “Well, what? We haven’t counted the ballots. We have millions of ballots to count.” It’s a disaster. Everyone knows it. Everyone knows it’s a disaster. And I don’t expect people here to say, although some people will, some people would say it… everyone knows, you don’t even have to know politics to know. And this has nothing to do with Post Office, by the way, where are these ballots going? Who sending them? Who’s signing them?(27:51)
You have in Nevada, you have a governor that signs something, where he does a one verification of the signature. So what does that mean? So he doesn’t even want verification of the signature. So I think it’s going to be a terrible time for this country. And we’re counting on federal judges to do a great constitutional job when they are… They’re right now, analyzing it. Many, many federal judges, many like, I think five or six. but many federal judges. I can tell you in Pennsylvania, big, in Nevada, very big. I believe it’s in front of a judge in Michigan. We have a lot of judges have not yet ruled on this. But if it’s ruled in a different manner, or it’s ruled where these millions and millions of unsolicited people that aren’t even asking, is such a difference. You write in, you ask, they send it to you, you sign it, you send it back, that’s perfect. That’s absentee. There’s nothing like going to the voter booth, by the way, nothing, where they check you as you go in. There’s nothing like that. But that’s absentee, that’s okay.(28:59)
But the scam of sending millions and millions of ballots… and you know, who knows this better than I do, the Democrats. They know it’s going to be a mess. They know there are going to be millions of missing ballots or tremendous numbers of missing ballots. You could be talking about large percentages of these ballots are going to be missing. There’s going to be fraud. It’s a disaster. (29:21)
And it’d be a lot easier for me not to bring it up, but everybody knows I’m right. And you don’t have to know a lot about elections. You don’t have to know a lot about politics. This is going to be the scam of all time. And hopefully, the federal judges, all respected, all highly respected, hopefully, they’ll be able to see this clearly and stop it. Okay, thank you very much, everybody. (29:46)
So I want to congratulate Puerto Rico, and I think you’re going to have a great period of time. I think you’re going to see a rebuilding of Puerto Rico. Thank you very much."
trump_economic_club.txt,"(00:00)
We’re right outside the Oval Office in the Rose Garden, very special place. And it’s an honor to once again, address the Economic Club of New York, as well as the economic clubs of Chicago, Florida, Pittsburgh, Sheboygan, and Washington D.C. I know so many people that are proud members and they’re great people. And it’s a great honor to be with you, especially in this very strange kind of a year with what we have to do communication-wise. To be doing it, really, it’s quite nice. It’s a quite nice way to do it. The choice facing America is simple. It’s the choice between historic prosperity under my pro-American policies, or very crippling poverty and a steep depression under the radical left. And that’s what you’ll have is a depression. I will deliver optimism, opportunity, and growth. They will deliver pessimism, stagnation, decline, and very high taxes. Simply put it’s a choice between a socialist nightmare and the American dream.(01:06)
Under my leadership, we will have a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year, we will swiftly defeat the China virus, end the pandemic, bring back our critical supply chains, and lift our economy to unprecedented new heights. If the left gains power they will shut down the economy, close our schools, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and impose the most extreme policies in the history of our country. Let’s review the record. When I joined you in-person last year, our nation was enjoying the greatest economy in history. There was nothing like it. This was a stark contrast to the prior administration, which delivered the weakest recovery since the Great Depression. It was weak, and it was sad. In my first three years, real income for the typical family increased $6,000, more than five times the gains during the entire previous administration. Think of that. Five times the gains. Income for black Americans grew nine times more under my leadership, than during the eight years before I took office.(02:18)
Their policies punish American workers, my policies promote American workers. At the end of the last administration, the Congressional Budget Office projected fewer than 2 million jobs would be created in three years. Well, we did a little bit better than that. We created 7 million, and actually it’ll be close to 8 million jobs by the time the final numbers came in. We lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, achieving the largest poverty reduction in modern U.S history. Poverty rates for our African Americans and Hispanic Americans reached record lows. Inequality declined dramatically, a complete reversal of the Obama years. My policies that benefited those who need it the most. The bottom 50% of households saw an astonishing 40% increase in net worth. Wages rose the fastest for blue collar workers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American. Unemployment all reached their lowest levels ever recorded.(03:24)
The last administration sold out American workers like never before, and they sold them to donors, special interests, and globalists. And if you take a look, we have probably plenty of them watching right now, and I understand where you’re coming from, but it didn’t work out too well with me. We succeeded by reversing those cruel and heartless betrayals. Instead of rewarding companies for outsourcing jobs, I implemented massive tax cuts and regulation cuts to keep jobs, opportunity, and wealth in America. The tax cuts and the regulation cuts were the biggest ever recorded in the history of our country. Instead of waging war on the American Energy, we unleashed American Energy to make the United States the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth. Instead of corrupt and horrendous trade deals written by lobbyists and special interests, again, some of you, I negotiated pro-American trade deals based on the principles of fairness and reciprocity. Very important.(04:30)
I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. I’ve taken the toughest ever action against China’s chronic trade abuses that we all know so well. I immediately canceled the last administration’s job killing transpacific partnership. And I renegotiated the South Korea deal, which was a disaster. China unleashed the virus onto the world, and only a Trump administration will hold them accountable. And if this administration, if I don’t get elected in a little while, 20 days, China will own the United States. I can tell you that. When the China virus arrived, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II. To defeat the virus I’m breaking through every obstacle, cutting every piece of red tape, and moving heaven and earth. The FDA has been fantastic. They’re approving things in one week that would have taken two years. I’m not interested in making friends in the corrupt media, and it is corrupt. My sole focus is protecting American lives and making lives good for American people.(05:45)
We’ll beat this virus and we’ll eradicate this pestilence and all of the things that happened to our country, our lives and our planet. Our aggressive and early action saved up to 2 million lives. If you look at the original numbers, it was projected at 2.2 million lives. We’re at 210,000. And one is too many, it should’ve never happened, should have never been allowed to happen by China. Thanks to advances in treatment we pioneered in record time, we’ve reduced the fatality rate 85% since April. And that number is now gone even better. I’m also working to get emergency approval for the powerful antibody treatment I received that has shown extraordinary promise. As you know, a week ago, I wasn’t feeling so hot, and I had a drug, Regeneron, that it made me feel very good, very fast. They call it therapeutic, but I don’t think it was therapeutic. I think it was a cure. For me, it was something that was very good. Now who knows, maybe that would have happened anyway. Maybe I would have recovered beautifully anyway. All I know is once I had Regeneron, it worked out very well.(06:55)
Under Operation Warp Speed, we’re on track to deliver at least 100 million doses of a vaccine before the end of the year, with hundreds of millions more to quickly follow. Our military will be delivering it. We have the best people on earth in our military, and we will deliver the drug, we will deliver the vaccine rapidly. Unfortunately, the media’s constant efforts to stoke panic and hysteria, and to probably change an election, that’s what they really want to do, have undermined our public health efforts and put innocent lives in danger. They will not have success in changing the election. They tried that four years ago, that didn’t work out too well. Americans should be trusted with the facts, the data, and the truth. For the young and healthy, the risk is exceedingly low. 99.98% of those under the age of 50 survive. The average age of those who succumb to the virus is 78. And usually that is a person who’s 78, but has bad heart, diabetes, has other problems. That’s why we’re so focused on protecting elderly, and higher risk Americans.(08:09)
Our groundbreaking therapies have significantly improved outcomes for elderly patients. But I will not rest and I will not relent until all American seniors are safe. That is my sacred obligation. I love our seniors. I love our country. At the same time, we must allow lower risk Americans to resume normal activity. The unscientific lockdowns pushed by left wing Politicians are needlessly destroying millions of lives. They decimate livelihoods and lead to suicide, drug, overdose, depression, heart disease, delayed medical treatments, and reduced life expectancy. The cure can not be worse than the problem itself. And that’s what a lot of run by Democrats have done to their people, and it’s turning out very, very bad for them. These lives must be protected as well. The recent months, I have also acted swiftly to rescue the U.S economy with an unprecedented $2.5 trillion in aid. We delivered over $160 million in relief payments for our hardworking Americans through our Paycheck Protection Program that all of you are familiar with.(09:26)
My administration has approved over $650 billion in forgivable loans to more than 5.2 million small businesses. It’s been a savior. This action has saved and supported 50 million jobs, and we think that number is going to be, when it’s finally put down in actual fact, we think it’s going to be even more than that. We increased unemployment benefits by $600. When Democrats fail to extend this assistance, I provided up to $400 a month in continued relief. I froze student loan payments, stopped evictions, suspended payroll taxes, and delivered $500 billion to save major U.S employers, including airlines. As a result of these decisive actions, the U.S has been both the smallest economic contraction it has seen. Think of that. With all that we’ve done and all the countries out there, some great and not so great, we’ve seen the smallest economic contraction and the fastest recovery of any major Western country. I hope people are taking note of that. And it’s not even close. We’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs since May. That’s another record.(10:47)
Under the previous administration, it took 30 months to recover more than half the jobs lost in the crisis. We surpassed that milestone in fewer than five months. Just a few months ago, most experts were projecting unemployment well over 10% through the end of 2020. Instead we’ve already cut unemployment below 8%. Something that it took the last administration over three years to do. Jobs have been recovering 23 times faster than the Obama recovery. Remember that. 23 times faster. And I know these numbers must be true because they were given to me by the great Larry Kudlow, who sitting on my left. Consumer spending is almost 10% higher today than before the pandemic, and automobile production has recovered 100%. Home sales are at their highest reading since December, 2006. And home builder sentiment is the highest in recorded history. Think of that. The highest home builder sentiment in recorded history and we’re in a pandemic. And I will tell you we’re rounding that final turn.(12:01)
If the left gains power, the recovery will be terminated and the economy will be destroyed. They’ve told us their exact plans. Left wing politicians have pledged a $4 trillion tax hike, which will destroy our country. And this will raise taxes on 80% of our taxpayers, cut the child tax credit in half, which is $1000 per child, and punished working families. The highest business tax rate in the developed world would be created, sending millions and millions of jobs out of America, into China and various other countries. They’ll be thrilled if we do what Joe Biden wants to do. But it’s not really him that wants to do it, it’s other people that are at a much higher level than Joe. Reentering the job rec in Paris, climate accord, eliminating fossil fuels, shutting down fracking. All over the country they want to shut down fracking. We are right now energy independent. They want to close up, shut down fracking. And enacting the ridiculous Green New Deal, which will cost 100 trillion dollars, which is more money than this country can make in 100 years if everything went perfectly.(13:17)
Democrat lawmakers sponsored legislation that would outlaw the private health insurance plans for 180 million Americans. So you have these private plans that people love, they’ve negotiated, they fought for, they went to different companies, all great companies. They have plans that they love. 180 million plans, 180 million people. And you know what happens to them? It’s over. They take it away. The Democrat platform would suspend all immigration enforcement and give free healthcare and mass amnesty to illegal aliens. The problem is our country can’t afford it. And as soon as you announce that, millions and millions of people, despite the wall, which is almost finished and by the way, paid for by Mexico, despite all of these things that we’ve done, millions of people would flood into our country. This would obliterate Medicare and would totally demolish your social security.(14:15)
Democrats in Washington are also pushing a plan to abolish the suburbs by eliminating single family zoning and linking federal highway grants to a federal takeover of local zoning. Your suburbs will be gone. The American dream will be gone. This plan will devastate the property values of millions of middle-class homeowners, including the majority of African-American Hispanic, American and Asian American households who live in the suburbs. The policies of the left would unleash a lasting economic catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. And I know I’m speaking to some Democrats, and some of you are friends of mine, you will see things happen that will not make you happy. I don’t understand your thinking. I don’t understand how you can be backing such policies, but you’re wrong. I can only assume it’s habit. You’ve been there for a long time and it’s habit. Because they will destroy this country. Our country will go into a depression, the likes of which we have not seen since 1929 and maybe worse. So keep backing them, but you know it’s wrong. And I really do believe it’s only habit, that’s the only reason you can be doing it.(15:37)
Under my continued leadership, we will continue our V-shaped recovery and launch a record smashing economic boom. We will end the pandemic with a safe and effective vaccine, create 10 million jobs in the first 10 months of 2021, where we’re going to have a phenomenal year, and we will soon be announcing in my opinion, a phenomenal, a phenomenal record setting Third quarter and quickly returned to full employment. I will implement a middle class tax cut, reduce regulations that stifle small businesses. And we’ve already cut regulations more than any president in history, whether it’s four years, eight years or in one case more, I have cut regulations far more than any president in the history of our country. A highway that would take 21 years to get approved, we can get done now in one year. And it may be rejected for safety or environmental reasons, but you’re going to know in one year we brought it down to a level that nobody could even believe. It may get rejected, but it’s going to get rejected fast, but most likely it’ll get built fast.(16:46)
And we also are expanding opportunities zones, which have been fantastic. We will launch a bold initiative to reassure our medical and pharmaceutical supply chains. As part of this effort, I’ll revive Puerto Rico’s pharmaceutical industry. We will keep taxes low for companies and move jobs to America. And we’ll impose steep tariffs on any company that leaves. They want to leave, they want to make our product and then sell it back after firing everybody, not going to happen. They will be tariffed. We will strip federal contracts from companies that outsource critical industries. We will, and this is just has to do, negotiate more fair and reciprocal trade deals. We want reciprocal deals. If you look at Europe and if you look at what Europe has done to us over many, many years, and we’re bringing it back into balance, but it’s way unbalanced. We protect them militarily and then they take advantage of us on trade with tariffs and non-monetary tariffs, which are worse. We have to put America first, like other countries should put themselves first, but we’re putting America first.(17:56)
We will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, ending reliance on China once and for all. We will ensure that America remains the world’s number one energy producer. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which goes into effect already on January 1st, and further reduce the cost of prescribe prescription drugs as you probably know. Those of you that are in the drug industry, you’re not a big fan of Donald Trump I can tell you, but I instituted a favored nations clause. So if Germany or another nation is buying the drug for one 20th of what we pay, believe it or not, in some cases you have price discrepancies like that, we go to the lowest price anywhere in the world. We’re the largest purchaser of drugs, we go to the lowest price. So if somebody’s selling a pill for 25 cents and we’re paying $2.50 cents, we go to 25 cents. And the 25 cents will come up a little bit, but your drug prices will be reduced by 50, 60, 70, 80, 90%. That’s the way it is.(19:04)
We will strongly protect Medicare, social security and patients with pre-existing conditions. And as far as the middleman is concerned, the middleman is out. As far as purchasing drugs from other countries until everything else kicks in, Canada pays 50% what we pay. I’ve given governor’s permission to go to Canada and buy drugs directly from Canada, saving as an example, Ron DeSantis the State of Florida, approximately 50% and more on the purchase of drugs. So they’ll buy the same exact drug from the same exact plant or lab for 50% less. I’ve also outlined a new plan to provide historic prosperity, and this is really so important, to the black community known as the Platinum Plan, creating new wealth, new access to capital and school choice as a civil right for every American family. We need school choice. The Democrats will never give you school choice. They will never give you charter schools that have worked so well.(20:09)
We’re lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We’re delivering a future of fairness, justice, and dignity for every community in our land. And we’re defending our values, our principles, and our cherished way of life. And guided by these timeless convictions, we will make next year one of the single greatest years in the history of our country. It’s an honor to be with you. I think I’ll be with you next year again, but we’ll have to see because if I don’t win the election, you probably won’t want me. And that’s okay with me too. But I think we’re going to have a tremendous success. We’re having lines of people, 30, 40, 50,000 people lining up to see a speech with one day notice. And my opponent is getting 22 people with working very hard to get them. So I don’t know. I think we’re going to have a tremendous success. I hope so. But next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country. You’re going to see growth like we haven’t seen before, and it’s an honor to be with you. God bless you all."

Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Please sit. Thank you. This is without question the latest news conference I’ve ever had. Thank you. I appreciate it very much. And I want to thank the American people for their tremendous support, millions and millions of people voted for us tonight. And a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people and we won’t stand for it. We will not stand for it.(00:54)
I want to thank the first lady, my entire family, and Vice President Pence, Mrs. Pence for being with us all through this. And we were getting ready for a big celebration. We were winning everything and all of a sudden it was just called off. The results tonight have been phenomenal and we are getting ready… I mean, literally we were just all set to get outside and just celebrate something that was so beautiful, so good. Such a vote, such a success to citizens of this country have come out in record numbers. This is a record. There’s never been anything like it to support our incredible movement. We won states that we weren’t expected to win. Florida, we didn’t win it. We won it by a lot.(01:54)
We won the great State of Ohio. We won Texas, we won Texas. We won Texas. We won Texas by 700,000 votes and they don’t even include it in the tabulations. It’s also clear that we have won Georgia. We’re up by 2.5% or 117,000 votes with only 7% left. They’re never going to catch us. They can’t catch us. Likewise we’ve clearly won North Carolina. Where we’re up 1.4%. We’re 77,000 votes with only approximately 5% left. They can’t catch us. We also, if you look and you see Arizona, we have a lot of life in that. And somebody declared that it was a victory for… And maybe it will be. I mean, that’s possible. But certainly there were a lot of votes out there that we could get because we’re now just coming into what they call Trump territory. I don’t know what you call it. But these were friendly Trump voters. And that could be overturned.(03:14)
The gentleman that called it, I watched tonight. He said, “Well, we think it’s fairly unlikely that he could catch.” Well, fairly unlikely? And we don’t even need it. We don’t need that. That was just a state that if we would have gotten it, it would have been nice. Arizona. But there’s a possibility, maybe even a good possibility. In fact, since I saw that originally it’s been changed and the numbers have substantially come down just in a small amount of votes. So we want that obviously to stay in play. But most importantly, we’re winning Pennsylvania by a tremendous amount of votes.(04:14)
We’re up 600… Think of this. Think of this. Think of this. We’re up 690,000 votes in Pennsylvania, 690,000. These aren’t even close. This is not like, “Oh, it’s close…” With 64% of the vote in, it’s going to be almost impossible to catch. And we’re coming into good Pennsylvania areas where they happen to like your president. I mean, it’s very good. So we’ll probably expand that. We’re winning Michigan, but I’ll tell you, I looked at the numbers. I said, “Wow.” I looked, I said, “Wow, that’s a lot.” By almost 300,000 votes and 65% of the vote is in and we’re winning Wisconsin. And I said, “Well, we don’t need all of them. We need…” Because when you add Texas in, which wasn’t added, I spoke with the really wonderful governor of Texas just a little while ago, Greg Abbott, he said, “Congratulations.” He called me to congratulate me on winning Texas.(05:26)
I mean, we won Texas. I don’t think they finished quite the tabulation, but there’s no way. And it was almost complete, but he congratulated me. Then he said, “By the way, what’s going on? I’ve never seen anything like this.” Can I tell you what, nobody has. So we won by 107,000 votes with 81% of the vote. That’s Michigan. So when you take those three states in particular and you take all of the others, I mean, we have so many… We had such a big night. You just take a look at all of these states that we’ve won tonight, and then you take a look at the kind of margins that we’ve won it by, and all of a sudden, it’s not like we’re up 12 votes and we have 60% left. We won states. And all of a sudden I said, “What happened to the election? It’s off.” And we have all these announcers saying what happened? And then they said, “Oh.”(06:24)
Because you know what happened? They knew they couldn’t win so they said, “Let’s go to court.” And did I predict this, Newt? Did I say this? I’ve been saying this from the day I heard they were going to send out tens of millions of ballots. They said exactly, because either they were going to win or if they didn’t win, they’ll take us to court. So Florida was a tremendous victory. 377,000 votes. Texas, as we said. Ohio, think of this. Ohio a tremendous state, a big state. I love Ohio. We won by 8.1%, 460,00…think of this. Almost 500,000 votes. North Carolina, a big victory with North Carolina. So we won there. We lead by 76,000 votes with almost nothing left. And all of a sudden everything just stopped.(07:28)
This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. We did win this election. So our goal now is to ensure the integrity for the good of this nation. This is a very big moment. This is a major fraud in our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. So we’ll be going to the US Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don’t want them to find any ballots at four o’clock in the morning and add them to the list. Okay? It’s a very sad moment. To me this is a very sad moment and we will win this. And as far as I’m concerned, we already have won it.(08:30)
So I just want to thank you. I want to thank all of our support. I want to thank all of the people that worked with us. And Mr. Vice President, say a few words, please. Please.08:46)
Thank you, Mr. President. I want to join you in thanking more than 60 million Americans who have already cast their vote for four more years for president Donald Trump in the White House. While the votes continue to be counted, we’re going to remain vigilant, as the president said. The right to vote has been at the center of our democracy since the founding of this nation and we’re going to protect the integrity of the vote. But I really believe with all of my heart, with the extraordinary margins, Mr. President, that you’ve inspired in the states that you just described, and the way that you launched this movement across the country to make America great again, I truly do believe as you do that we are on the road to victory and we will make America great again, again. Thank you, Mr. President.(09:51)
Thank you very much [inaudible 00:09:56]. Thank you very much."

Thank you very much Grand Rapids, you know, this is … This was our final night prior to a very, very big victory, that was it. Remember? We left at around 1:00 in the morning. I got home, my wife said, now First Lady, said, “You have to be kidding.” We came home late and then we watched the beautiful victory, and we’re going to have another beautiful victory tomorrow. And we’re going to win the state of … You know what we’re going to win, we’re going to win the state so easily. We’re going to win the state of Michigan so easily. We want to do it just like last time. But let’s give me a little bit more margin than that if you don’t mind.:06)
Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.(01:21:18)
So we’re going to win the state of Michigan and we are going to win four more years in that very beautiful, beautiful, beautiful house. It’s called the White House. We made history together four years ago, and tomorrow we’re going to make history once again. So this has been really, this was amazing, Grand Rapids, I’ll never forget it though.(01:21:44)
We were called, late in the evening, Ronna, thank you very much, wherever you may be. She kept calling, say, “One more trip, one more trip to Michigan, I’m telling you, one more trip.” And then we heard crooked Hillary was coming back because they were hearing … Oh, you know, Michigan hadn’t been won for a long time, many, many years by a Republican. We heard that Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary, Bill, and Bill was the only one that got it right. Said, “You don’t want to run against Trump,” he said that very early. He was the only one, he’s the only one that understood what was going on actually.(01:22:23)
But they came and they came and they wanted to be in Michigan, which was unscheduled. So I got a call from Ronna, the whole group, and they said, “Could you go back?” We got here at 12:00 in the evening, I started speaking at 12:30, now election day, I’ll never forget it. We had 32,000 people, almost as many as we have tonight. And I said to my team, “We have to … This is it.” We’ve done five, but actually six, because we ended up last night around 2:00 in the morning in Miami, so we can say that includes this … So that would be six. We’ve done six of these big, and every one was just a lot of people. And you know what? There was a lot of love. There was a lot of love. We had a lot of love.(01:23:15)
We had 45,000 people in Florida last night. By the way, we’re doing very well in Florida. We’re doing very, very well in Wisconsin. We’re doing very well in Texas, I hear great things about Texas. You know they’re saying Texas may be even … Well, you know, then you think sleepy Joe Biden’s against guns. That’s not good for Texas, right? He’s against oil. Oil isn’t good. If you’re against oil, that’s not good politics, right Texas? And he’s against god. Right?(01:23:54)
When you have guns, oil, and god, and he’s doing well in Texas, I don’t think so. But I actually know for a fact we’re doing very well in Texas. I think we’re doing very well all over. I think you’re going to have, I don’t know if it’s as much of a … I don’t know what’s a surprise. We fulfilled everything we said we were going to fulfill, and that’s why people are [inaudible 01:24:17](01:24:19)
And we did some things that we never even talked about, right? We never talked about Space Force. We got it. And I said you know what? I looked at Russia, I looked at China, and I said, “We need Space Force.” And we did it, first time in 74 years, not since the Air Force.(01:24:34)
But I want to thank you all. We have a great group of people here. I’d like to show our appreciation for our phenomenal vice president, Mike Pence, and his amazing wife Karen. Did he make a good speech? I saw him on the plane and I couldn’t sort of … Did he make a good speech? Huh? He’s great, I’ll tell you what. It was close, it was close. If I had my choice between Mike and Kamala, I think it’s a very close choice, but I think I’ll take Mike. I think we’ll stick with Mike and Karen. No.(01:25:14)
By the way, how badly did he beat her in that debate? Did you ever hear the expression, if that were a fight they would have stopped it.:25)
He did great.(01:25:27)
But anyway. No, Mike’s been great from day one, and I appreciate it. I also want to thank Don, Jr., Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany. Words cannot express how proud you make me every single day. No matter what happens tomorrow, I’m very proud of you all.:45)
We love you Don, Jr.(01:25:46)
But if we don’t win I’ll never speak to them again. They like him. They like them all. No no. I’m very proud. We’re very proud of you. Thank you. Look at these people. There’s a lot of spirit here. A lot of spirit.(01:26:08)
No, it’s funny though, I kept saying we have to finish off here. We have to do it. It’s just we could be a little bit superstitious, right? But you people, you’ve been great, you’ve been great. And I think we’re going to have a tremendous victory in Michigan.(01:26:22)
Don’t forget, four years ago I said, “Why are so many car companies leaving?” You know, you were losing everything to Mexico and to China and to frankly Canada, and you were losing everything. And we stopped it, and now you have many, many car plants that have already been built, are being built, renovations, 17 … You didn’t have a deal in like 42 years. It was always going out. Now they’re all coming in. I want to thank Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I said, “Shinzo, Shinzo, you got to do me a favor, Shinzo. You got to build some plants.” And he said, “No, no, no, we are the government, we don’t do that. That’s up to the private sector.” I said, “No, Shinzo, you got to do it. You got to do it. It’s not fair. You’re sending too many cars and they’re built in Japan. We wanted them built in Michigan, we wanted them built in Ohio, we want them built in South Carolina and North Carolina. We got to do it.”(01:27:17)
He says, “But I do not do that, Donald.” And the next day they announced five companies are coming to Michigan. But he’s a great guy. And he retired. He had some difficulty with his health, but he was a great prime minister of Japan, and he did a great favor to Michigan and to us, all of us, he’s a … We have a lot of activity in Michigan. It would be nice if your governor would open up the state, however. Would open up the state. Open up your schools, open up the state, go back. Get back to business.:02)
Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up.(01:28:02)
The only one that’s allowed to roam free is her husband. What’s her husband like? Remember? That wasn’t so long ago. He’s allowed to do whatever he wants. But everybody else, you’re not allowed to leave your house or your apartment. No, she’s got to open it up. Well they will. On November 4th, she’ll announce, “Okay, now we’re going to open.” You know, they’re doing that for political … They think it hurts us in the election. Actually it helps us, okay? Who has voted so far? Has anyone voted? Okay, good. Because you’re saving it, right? You’re saving it for Tuesday? Right? No, we’re cool. We’re going to have a red wave, they call it the great red wave like nobody’s ever seen before. Like nobody’s ever seen. So based on just early results though, Florida looks like it’s phenomenal. Just phenomenal. North Carolina’s looking great. I think they’re all looking great. Ohio is looking fantastic.(01:29:05)
You know, we won Ohio last time by eight points, and I said, “Well why are …” These fake polls that they put out, they’re called suppression polls. If they make them bad enough, they hope you don’t want to waste your time and vote, right? We love our president, but if he’s losing by 250 points, let’s stay home and have dinner, darling.(01:29:27)
It doesn’t work, because you people don’t, you don’t go for the bait do you?:31)
No.(01:29:31)
It’s really amazing. And I think we’re winning. I think we’re going to win everything. I think tomorrow’s going to be-:40)
Big win.(01:29:41)
… one of the greatest wins in the history of politics.(01:29:49)
I want to give the very special thank you also to Jared Kushner, who is in the process of negotiating a little thing called peace in the Middle East. Great guy. Great guy. They like that. They like the sound. Peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand, no blood in the sand, and no cost, just peace. Already three countries, UAE, a great leader, Mohammed, great leader. And three countries have already signed. Bahrain. It’s already signed. Sudan. And we have many, many countries, how many do we have lined up? It’ll be more than 10.(01:30:41)
Now what would happen if sleepy Joe Biden had to take over the deal? You know what happens? That’s the end of that deal. You can forget that deal. The sleepy one.(01:30:51)
Lara Trump, thank you Lara, what a job you do. What a job you do. You know, Lara’s a specialist on a place called North Carolina, I will tell you. She lived there and she grew up there and they love her there, and Pennsylvania, that extends to Pennsylvania next door, and you said that we’re doing phenomenally there, right? So I think that’s right. She said win. I think they’re both wins, big wins. We got to be careful though, because the Pennsylvania deal with that decision, oh, you can count the ballots later on, and count them whenever you’d like. No. No. We have to be very, very careful with that, that causes a lot of problems.(01:31:32)
I want to thank Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly is fantastic, from day one. I’d watch her on The Five, and she always liked me, right from the beginning, so I always liked her. If they don’t like me, I never like them. It’s funny the way that works. But she was their big star, and she did great, and thank you very much Kimberly, I appreciate it very much.(01:31:59)
And Tiffany, thank you for the job you do. She goes around from place to place. She just graduated from law school. She just graduated from Georgetown. She did a great job. Thank you, honey, thank you very much. And Michael, thank you very much. Thank you very much.(01:32:17)
To all of our supporters here tonight, I really want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We’ve worked very hard in four years. We’ve been hit by fake, fake investigations, fake scandals, fake impeachments.(01:32:30)
We’ve had so many things that, the witch hunt, I call it the witch hunt. And it turned out to be a phony witch hunt, and they should have known it the first day. They did know it the first day. But it’s the deep state, it’s whatever you want to call it, but it should have never happened. Think of it. They spied on our campaign. They got caught. They tried to take down a duly elected president of the United States. They got caught. And you know who knew all about it? Barack Hussein Obama and sleepy Joe Biden. They knew all about it. They knew all about it.:11)
Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up.(01:33:12)
And then I watch the fake news back there, look at all of them. Look at all of the fake news, isn’t that nice. It’s a lot of fake news. Then I watch the fake news saying, “You know, his attitude is a very tough attitude. He’s not very nice, he’s a very nasty person.” No no. We’re defending ourselves, and we’re defending all of these people that voted for us. With these fake …(01:33:38)
And then what happens? It turns out to be that it was them that were guilty of all of these horrible crimes. Including the crime of treason, because when you try and take down a duly elected president, you know, it’s called treason, it’s called big stuff. It’s big stuff. So we’re going to see how that all works out. We’re going to see how that. But that’s another reason we want to go for a long time, frankly. Because you know what? We started something incredible. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We then had to close it down for a period of time. We saved millions of lives. Remember the original estimate was 2.2 million people would die from the China plague, and they could have kept it in China. They didn’t get infected in the rest of China after Wuhan Province. But it came out to the world, it came out to Europe and the United States and 188 countries all over the world. And we can never forget that.(01:34:43)
We signed a great trade deal with China, but it doesn’t mean so … The ink wasn’t dry, and all of a sudden this happened.(01:34:52)
But the job we’ve done, when you see the numbers, and you’re going to hear the numbers because they’re coming out very soon, the job we’ve done has been an incredible job. We had to close it up. We saved millions of lives. We now opened it up. You saw what happened. 33.1%. The fastest in the history of our country. The fastest growth, the biggest growth in the history of our country.(01:35:18)
But you’ve been there right from the beginning, we’ve all been together, and I’ll tell you what, we very much appreciate it. And think of how it could have been different, except I think in a way we would have been less popular. Somebody said, because they would have said just another presidency. This time, you know we had to fight for you. We had to fight. You understood it. You understood the hoax better than anybody. It was a hoax. The Russian hoax. And after spending $48 million, 18 angry Democrats, and smart people, vicious, they were vicious, they were smart. If they could find any little morsel.(01:35:54)
And they went over taxes. And they went over everything you can go over. They spent $48 million, two and a half years. The Mueller investigation scam. And they come up, no collusion, there’s no collusion after all of that. Which makes me perhaps the most innocent man anywhere in the history of the United States.(01:36:22)
Now a friend of mine called me up, very smart guy. He said, “I can’t imagine anybody could go through two and a half years, $48 million, 18 killers, some of whom worked for Hillary Clinton, right? Crooked Hillary. And it turned out they’re the ones dealing with Russia. What a disgrace.”(01:36:41)
So let’s see what happens. It’s too bad it’s going so slowly. There’s plenty of info there, and I try and stay uninvolved. Someday I’m going to have to get involved, maybe. I try and stay uninvolved. Going too slowly. “No sir, we’d rather not do anything before the election.” Well they did it to me before, they did during, before, and after. These are bad people, Comey, the worst director in the history of the FBI. A crooked person.(01:37:12)
Did you leak? Remember? “Chuck Grassley. Did you leak the information to the newspapers?” He choked when he heard Chuck Grassley from Iowa, great gentleman, great gentleman. He looked at that guy, he said, “Did you leak?” And he said, “Yes.” He choked. You know the guy choked like a dog, Comey. He leaked, he lied, he did a lot of things. You saw the report by Inspector General Horowitz, who by the way did a great report. That was a great report, Inspector General Horowitz, and I appreciate it. But you saw that on Comey. Comey should hang his head in disgrace.(01:37:48)
But we had to go through all this stuff. Think if we didn’t have any of it.(01:37:53)
We probably wouldn’t have done as well. It’s true. We might not have done as well. And we might not have these massive crowds, because you saw what was happening. You got it. We might not have had … So I just want to tell you, we appreciate you so much. We really do. We appreciate you so much.(01:38:13)
And now we have to build on what we’ve done. Nobody has done what we’ve done. No administration has done, thank you.:20)
We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you.(01:38:22)
Wow, I love you too.:23)
We love you. We love you.(01:38:24)
I love you too.:24)
We love you. We love you. We love you.(01:38:24)
Thank you very much.:24)
We love you. We love you.(01:38:24)
Thank you.:24)
We love you. We love you.(01:38:33)
That’s really nice. You know, in the history of politics, nobody’s ever heard that expression before, it’s true. Look, Ronald Reagan, we liked Ronald Reagan, right, but nobody ever said, “We love you, We love you.” Nobody’s ever heard it before. Nobody’s ever heard it before. It’s an expression, true, you know they were covering it the other night, they looking back, oh, they want to find it so badly. They want to find somebody so badly. But it’s never been said before to the best of anyone’s knowledge.(01:39:03)
… so badly, but it’s never been said before to the best of anyone’s knowledge, and we appreciate it. I’ll tell you what, when you hear that, I had a nice life. I had the greatest life. But you know what? I’m so happy. This was the greatest decision I ever made, because we have done so much good together. We’ve done it together. We couldn’t have done it without you, and we’ve done so much, from the biggest tax cuts in history, to regulation cuts, the biggest ever. We have cut regulations at a level that nobody believed. It would take 18 to 20 years to get a highway approved. We have it down to two. It’ll soon be down to one, and it may not get approved. It may be an environmental problem. It may be a safety problem, but it shouldn’t take 20 years, it shouldn’t take 19 years, 21 years. And by the time you get it approved, first of all, you start off as a young man on a highway project, and you end up in retirement, and then you get a rejection. ” We rejected three to two,” some board somewhere.(01:40:03)
No, we’ve done a great job, and we’ve rebuilt our military. We just got a 91% approval from our veterans. The veterans just gave us a 91% approval, highest we’ve ever gotten. With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our police, support our great military, protect your Second Amendment, which has gone if sleepy Joe Biden gets … Defend religious liberty, and ensure more products are proudly made with that beautiful, beautiful phrase, right? “Made in the USA.”(01:40:44)
Next year we will be, and I mean this, I think we have such a foundation-1:40:50)
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!(01:40:50)
This group over here. They’re an activist group. Thank you very much. Thank you, fellas.1:41:08)
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!(01:41:08)
It’s a great group. Thank you. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. So you had last year was the best year you ever had. Before that was the best year. You had three of them with me, and then we got hit with the plague, and then we went back to work. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded. 33.1% last week. And if you look at the auto business, auto business, I don’t know what’s going on. It’s at a level that it’s never been at. What is that all about? What is that all about? You wouldn’t think, and this is during a pandemic.(01:41:50)
We’re rounding the turn, by the way. They hate it when I say it, but we’re rounding the turn. They used to say, “Look at the way Europe’s doing.” Well, take a look at Europe. Take a look. And what we’ve done in terms of the economy, we went down less than any major country in the world, or any country. And now we’ve gone up far faster and far higher than any country in the world. It’s not even close. And it should be tougher because of the size, because we’re a big country.(01:42:20)
We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months alone, which is another record. That’s another big record. We’ve never hired that many people that fast. While foreign nations are in a free fall, we’re creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. A recent Gallup Poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under Obama and Biden. And if Biden and Kamala … You don’t have to say it “Kamala.” “Kamala.” If Biden and Kamala Harris, who’s further left by far than crazy Bernie Sanders, right, he’s considered a strict conservative compared to her. How the hell did he ever pick her, Mike? Where’s Mike. How did that ever happen? That turned out … I don’t think that’s going to be a good pick. You’re going to find out tomorrow.(01:43:23)
By the way, she happens to be slightly against fracking. She’s still against fracking. Isn’t that amazing? Isn’t that amazing? Biden goes like, “I’m against …” For a year and a half, he’s running, running. Nobody gave him a chance because he never got more than 1% in prime time, right? 25 years ago, the guy never got 1%. And he never had what it took. He was a glad hander. Not a smart guy. Not a nice guy, either. By the way, not a nice guy. But he was, I used to call him 1% Joe, because he ran for president all the time and he never got more than 1%. Now he’s got half the intelligence he had 20 years ago and he wins. Politics is a strange business. A strange, very strange business. But if Biden and Harris and the radical left gain power, they will collapse our economy and send our nation into a very steep depression. That’s what’s going to happen.(01:44:23)
This is the only man that I’ve ever seen run for office on the fact that he wants to give you the largest tax increase in the history of our country. No, that’s his space. The good news is, he has no idea what the hell he’s saying, so it doesn’t … He goes up. Here’s his line. “Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give you the biggest tax increase in the history of our country. It will be $4 trillion.” They’re going to increase your taxes by $4 trillion. $4 trillion tax increase. That’s his campaign, and they’re going to put the money in the Green New Deal, which is conceived and designated by AOC plus three, right? AOC plus … This was their deal. I think they ever took an environmental course. Did they go to college, by the way? I don’t think they ever took a course on the environment.(01:45:18)
But Biden wants to raise your taxes $4 trillion, massively increase regulations. You know, the regulations may have been more important than even the big tax cuts that you got. The biggest ever. You got the biggest tax cuts ever, and you know it. You know it. You felt that in a very, very good place. You know where it is? Your wallet. You felt it in your wallet. They want to close down your factories, send your jobs overseas, destroy the suburbs. Women of the suburbs, please, okay? Please.(01:45:55)
I wiped out a regulation that would have destroyed your home, to put it mildly. Would have destroyed your American dream. And Ben Carson is a great guy. I said, “Sir, why don’t we just do this? Why don’t we just sort of ease it up?” It’s a horrible regulation. What it does is a horrible thing, and everybody knows it. It would have destroyed the suburbs. I said, “Ben, let’s just cut it out. Let’s terminate it because there’s no negotiating here. Let’s just terminate it.” And I terminated it. And you know one thing I know about? The women of the suburbs, they want two things. They want their home. They want their family night, but they want safety, and they want security. And that’s what we provide.(01:46:38)
And I think this will be like four years ago. Remember? “Donald Trump will do very poorly with women.” At the end of the evening when they’re all crying, and I remember they were crying. Remember? Martha Raddatz. Oh, she was very impartial. She was another one of my debate anchors. I had some real beauties, didn’t I? She was crying, and they all said we’re going to do badly with women. I’m going to do terribly with women. I said, “Why? What’s so bad? Tell me what’s so bad.” And at the end of the evening, “He’s done very well with women. What happened?” No. But this time we’re going to do even better, because we are providing safety and security. And for the suburban women, I mean, we’re saving the suburbs. This regulation was so horrible, what it does to the suburbs. It would have destroyed the suburbs as we knew them.(01:47:30)
And I got to say this, 31% of the people living and moving to the suburbs are minority groups, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American. And they have a great American dream also, and then they want to live in the suburbs and they want to be proud, and they don’t want to live next to a project that somebody puts in because they play games with your zoning and other things. And all I can say is, for the women … I don’t even talk about the men in the suburbs. I don’t care about the men in the suburbs. I only care because they’re all saying … He’s going, “Oh, what about us?” I don’t worry about you.(01:48:13)
But the women of the suburbs are going to vote for President Trump, because we love you, and we’re saving you a horrible, a horrible thing was going to happen, frankly, and it’s been happening for years, and it’s been a very bad situation. So we solved it. We terminated it. It is gone. Now, if they get in, if they should get in, you can take that regulation and quadruple it, just like they want to quadruple your taxes. You can quadruple it. So I think that’ll be good. I think we’re going to have a great … Women, that’s a pretty hard pitch, but that’s the way it is, right?(01:48:48)
They want to dissolve your borders. We complete the wall in a very short period of time. We’re over 400 miles. Over 400 miles, and that’s right, Mexico is paying for the wall. You know, they like to say Mexico is, but we will have the wall completed very shortly. We’re over 400 miles right now. 400 miles, and we’re building 10 miles a week, and we now have the strongest numbers and the strongest border, Southern border that we’ve ever had. And you know what? We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally, and they have to come in through merit. We want people that can help us. We want people that can help us.(01:49:34)
They want to terminate religious liberty, outlaw private healthcare. 400 … Think of this. Think of this. Private healthcare. You work so hard. You have 180 million people that have a great healthcare plan, that love it. Private plans, and they want to end it and put you on socialized medicine. I don’t think so. I don’t think you’re going to be too happy. I don’t think … “We have a cold, let’s go to the hospital and let’s wait for nine days to see a doctor.” They want to confiscate your guns, Second Amendment, and indoctrinate your children with hateful anti-American lies. So you’ll be happy that I just signed on the plane, that’s beautiful Air Force One, and it is a beauty, I have to admit an executive order to teach our nation students pro-American values. That will be taught. Sleepy joe Biden has vowed to abolish and eradicate the American oil and natural gas industries, and he’s pledged to ban fracking. And you saw that. For a year, more than that, he’d get on stage with all these crazy people, radical left people, and they were screaming who could ban it faster. He would say, “Yes, I’d been fracking. I am totally against fracking.” For a year, “I am against fracking.” I could play 100 clips. See the board? Where is the board. I spent a lot of money for that today. He’s going, for a year, “I am against fracking.” Then he lucks out because Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren doesn’t get out, so she takes votes away from crazy Bernie, right? On Super Tuesday. And he loses by a little bit on each state, and Bernie loses again. This poor guy. Crazy Bernie. But he’s running again in four years. Don’t worry about it.(01:51:31)
No, he’s the best loser I’ve ever seen. He could lose … He lost with Hillary and they didn’t treat him too well. And then he lost, but Elizabeth Warren lost. If she would have gotten out, he would have had the votes. He would have won easily. So instead of a Crazy Bernie, I’m running against a sleepy guy, right? I’m running against a very sleepy guy. We can’t let the sleepy guy fool us, though, because he happens to be a corrupt politician, and they don’t want to write it. Biden’s energy plan will send every state into a crushing poverty situation, from Michigan to Minnesota. We’re going to win Minnesota because of Omar, and because we did a great job in stopping the riots in Minneapolis. The National Guard went in. They should have called them a lot sooner, like a week and a half. You wouldn’t have had half of your city burnt down. But Arizona, Pennsylvania. We’re doing great in Pennsylvania, by the way. I just got the word. I just got the word. We’re doing great in Pennsylvania. It’s looking good. I think you’re going to have a very exciting … You’re going to have a very exciting evening or day tomorrow, but evening in particular tomorrow.(01:52:44)
You know, when people see it, I walk in, we do polls, and they do a poll. “We interviewed 73 people, and President Trump is down 57 points.” This is a poll. See, this is a poll. When you draw crowds like this. This is not the crowd of somebody that’s going to lose the state of Michigan. This is not. This is not. And look at this crowd. You can’t even see the end of it. You can’t. This is not the crowd of a second place finisher. Do you agree with that? No. No. This is our crowd, all together. We’re in this together and we’re doing it together. As long as I’m President, we will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on this planet. And for the first time, we are energy independent. You never heard that term before. We’re energy independent, and you know, we have very good relationships in different parts of the world. In some we help. We don’t have to, though. Now we don’t have to do … We do what we want, but we have some very good allies and partners that we’ll help them, but we don’t need their oil anymore. We have so much oil. We have more oil than anybody, okay? And it’s an incredible thing that it’s happened over the last few years. A lot of great things. And you’re paying, what, $2 a gallon for your gasoline? That’s okay.(01:54:16)
You know what that’s like? That’s like a tax cut. That’s bigger than a tax cut. If Biden got in, you’d be paying $7, $8, $9. Then they’d say, “Get rid of your car. We’re going to build some more windmills. Kill all the birds.” Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that most of you have never even heard of, okay? A vote for Biden is a vote to eradicate your auto industry. Somehow I don’t think you want to do that in your particular state. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever made, and now we have USMCA, which is a great deal. What a difference. No, you were sending all your jobs.(01:55:08)
You know, 12 years ago, I was honored, believe it or not, the Man of the Year, and I was never thinking about doing this, the Man of the Year in Michigan. I’m still trying to figure out how that happened, and I got up and I said, “You know, you’re losing all your car business to Mexico, and Canada, too, by the way, and what are you doing? Why are you doing it?” And it was a whole big thing, became quite controversial as usual. But I was right, and it was probably the biggest reason that I ultimately ran for the presidency, because I saw how we were being ripped off. Not only the auto business, how we were being ripped off by every country of the world, friend and foe, on trade. And it just was something that was terrible.(01:55:50)
Now with the USMCA, they said there’s no way I would ever pull it off. “There’s no way you get rid of NAFTA.” You know why? Because Mexico and Canada loved it. I said, “Well, if they love it, that means it can’t be any good, right?” They said, “Sh, we never thought of that one.” So I wouldn’t say they’re exactly thrilled with USMCA, but we’re fine with it. We like it. But he was sending your auto jobs, so many of them, to Mexico, and it was terrible.(01:56:16)
Joe Biden supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which was the beginning of a disaster. It was good for China, but it was sure as hell bad for us. But you know, we won seven and a half billion dollars a little while ago, because we wouldn’t win anything. They had no respect for this country whatsoever, and now they know that if they don’t treat us right, we’ll pull out of that deal so fast. Now all of a sudden we’re winning all these cases, but we just won seven and a half billion dollars, which would have been impossible with a different president. You are so lucky I’ve agreed to be your president. Go out and vote for Trump.(01:56:56)
The seven and a half billion dollars we won, that was nice. Michigan lost half of all of its auto manufacturing jobs, because that was like a Biden and his friends, that was a betrayal to you and to many other states. He supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have eliminated your auto industry totally. I came in and immediately canceled it. I canceled it. I was so happy to cancel the TPP. I ended the NAFTA disaster. Canceled that one too. I’ve been an activist. Despite the fact that every week I’m being hit on all different sides, ” Let’s impeach him for having a perfect conversation with the President of Ukraine.” They were the ones that had the bad conversations, including his son making $183,000 a month to sit on the board of a company. His son. Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? His first name is, “Where.” Where’s Hunter? Remember that? I brought that up. A t-shirt was made overnight. It was the hottest selling t-shirt of the year. “Where’s Hunter?”(01:57:59)
You know where Hunter is? He’s buying vacuum cleaners, because he follows his father and he vacuums in money from every country that his father sees. No, seriously, Ukraine. His father was a judge of Russia, Ukraine, and China. President Obama entrusted him with those three countries. Those are the three beauties, right? Russia, Ukraine. So Russia, Moscow, the mayor of Moscow, his wife gives him three and a half million dollars, Hunter. Now he got dismissed from the military, was unemployed. His father becomes Vice President, and now all of a sudden he’s raking in money like you never saw. Now you tell me, is that honest? And then they say the big guy gets 10%. The big guy in some cases gets 50%.(01:58:48)
And then the last one is he asked China for $10 million here. This is Biden. They asked for $10 million, yeah, $10 million for introductory purposes. That’s what … Introductory purposes. So he’s going to introduce people to who? To his father, for which he gets $10 million a year. I never saw anything like this. And the fake news refuses to report it, because they don’t want it in there, because it’s not good for them. How about the Moscow? Three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Three and a half million dollars to, “Where’s Hunter?” You know, ” Where’s Hunter?” He’s at the bank depositing his money.(01:59:36)
Now think of it. So he gets a billion and a half from China. He goes with his father on Air Force Two, a plane that the great Vice President Mike Pence uses too. Mike, do your kids follow you to the various countries, raking in money? No. He’s got the greatest people, the greatest children, the greatest family. I don’t think they have, right, where they’re flying airplanes for our military. No they don’t. They do it a little differently. They do it the old fashioned way. No. Mike Pence, it’s a holder. I always compare … I say, “Can you imagine with Mike Pence?” How good we have it with Mike Pence compared to that. No, it’s great.(02:00:22)
How about the China, though? So the kid has no investment experience whatsoever. His father and him, they go into Air Force Two. In 10 minutes, like a 10-minute meeting, he walks out with a billion and a half dollars from China. They don’t do this for the biggest investment firms. I spoke to a friend of mine who’s one of the biggest guys on Wall Street. He said, “No, this is never done. They invest their own money. They don’t need people that are much dumber than them to invest their money. They invest their own money. They don’t do that.” Then he said, “Wow. That’s amazing. How long did it take him to get the money?” “About 10 minutes.” Walks out with a billion and a half dollars to invest, which is millions of dollars a year.(02:01:01)
And the fake news and big tech, big tech is getting very dangerous, very dangerous, but it’s one of the reasons we have to win. They have me trending every day on Twitter, Twitter Trending. They make up these stories, phony stores. They put up stories or they’ll take an old story, make it as bad. “Number one trend,” like some really boring story. Trending is like, you got to be cool, right? To trend. I’m trending number one, number two, number three. Everyone, “Negative, negative, negative.” How the hell did I ever win this thing? It’s such a fix with these people. I’m always trending with these stories that are like, either they didn’t happen, or they make them different. And I don’t want to act like a complainer, but it’s a totally rigged deal. And everyone said four years ago, they said, “Sir, you can’t win.” “Why?” “Because big tech is against you.” I said, “What’s big tech?” I didn’t even know what the hell it was, right?(02:01:52)
I learned fast, because I think we’re number one in the world now on social, so we learned very well. We got a lot of people. You know what? If I didn’t have … They say, “Don’t tweet.” Forget the tweet. It’s called social media. If we didn’t have social media, I’d have no voice. We wouldn’t be here. I have no choice. They say, “Gee, we wish she wouldn’t do so much tweeting.” I don’t do tweeting. What I do is social media. And without it, I don’t think we’d be here, because we’d have no voice. There’s no voice with these people. They’re dishonest people, mostly. Not in all cases, but Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who, what he’s done is he’s bled America dry.(02:02:34)
In 2016, Michigan voted to fire this corrupt political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because, thank you, I’m not a politician. Thank you very much. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because it was elected to fight for you, and I fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before. Joe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media, and powerful special interests. That’s why he takes in $300 million. They taken millions and millions of dollars for his crazy campaign, and he’s not going to win.(02:03:28)
I really don’t believe he’s going to win, because of this. Take a look. This is going on all over the country. They have tractors, thousands of tractors. You ever see this? Thousands in Iowa. We’re winning an Iowa very big, by the way, just in case. Thousands of tractors in Iowa on big farms, thousands and thousands. They have thousands of boats, 6,000 boats out in the lake, out in the ocean. They have things nobody’s ever seen anything like it. So I think we’re going to have a very big day, but they say you can’t win without big tech. Well, we’re going to find out tomorrow. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? But they said the same thing, they said the same thing four years ago. The head of CNN said, “You can’t win without CNN.” I said, “Really?” And we won, so now we have to do it again. They’re totally crooked. They’re fake news. CNN is fake. CNN and the others are fake news. They own Biden. They control him, and they know that he will always do their bidding.(02:04:28)
Every corrupt force in American life that betrayed you and hurt you is supporting Joe Biden. The failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars that hurt our country so badly and hurt our young people so badly, they support Sleepy Joe Biden. The career politicians that offshored your industries and decimated your factories and sent your jobs away, they support Biden. The open border lobbyists that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs and gangs and crime, they support Biden. The far left Democrats that ruined our public schools, depleted our inner cities, defunded our police, and demeaned your sacred faith and values, they support Biden. The anti-American radicals defaming our noble history, heritage, and heroes, they support Sleepy Joe Biden. Antifa, and the rioters, looters, Marxists, and left wing extremists, they all support Biden.(02:05:35)
This election comes down to a very simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the corrupt and selfless political maniacs that you’re dealing with? Or do you want to be ruled by the American people? You’re supposed to be ruled by the American people. Do you want to be represented by a career politician who hates you, by an outsider? I mean, just take a look. These people, what they do and what they get away with, and I guess that’s the other reason. I mean, I was in politics and I see what’s been happening to our country. Our country was going to hell, and we’ve turned it. And we got waylaid by this plague that came in, but we’ve done a job like nobody else has ever done a job, and you understand it. And that’s why there’s so many of you here tonight, and that’s why all over the country, this is happening. All over the country. And even they’re just springing up by themselves. I’m not there. I don’t do this. I mean, if you look, they had something today I read where 100 miles of cars all with the flag, the American flag, the Trump, a whole Trump thing.(02:06:49)
But do you want to be represented by a career politician who actually doesn’t like you, or by an outsider who will defend you like you have never been defended before? That’s what I’m doing. And it’s not easy, but there’s nothing I’ve ever enjoyed more in my life, because we are making so much progress. We have to now finish the progress. A vote for Biden is a vote to hand the keys of government over to people who don’t like you, don’t respect you, and who want to rob your children of their American dream. We have a great American dream. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let that happen. We’re going to keep our great American dream. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalists, and communists, and socialists, and wealthy, liberal hypocrites, and all of those that want to silence, censor, cancel, and punish you.(02:07:48)
If you want your children to be safe, if you want your values to be honored, if you want your life to be treated with dignity and respect, then I am asking you to go to the poll tomorrow and vote, vote, vote. Remember what I said four years ago. I am your voice, and we will make America great again, and that’s what we’re doing. For the last four years, the depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me and to stop you, because they know I don’t answer to them. I answer to you. That’s why we’re here. That’s why we’re here. Together we will defeat the corrupt establishment. We will dethrone the failed political class, and we will drain the Washington swamp. And we will save that American dream. That beautiful, beautiful American dream.(02:08:47)
This election is a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown, open up your state, governor, or a safe vaccine that ends up the pandemic and leads to the greatest economy in the history of the world. That’s where we’re going. We were there, and we’re going to get it back very quickly. And that’s going to bring our whole country together, because success brings it together, and it was happening. Before that plague came in, it was happening. People were calling me that you would least suspect, and it was all happening. And then we had to close it down and now build it up, and it’s building … It’s not a V. It’s a super V. It’s a super V.(02:09:28)
We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks. It will quickly eradicate the virus and wipe out the China plague once and for all. And whether we have the vaccine, great companies, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, but with or without it, we are rounding the turn. Just remember that. You know, they don’t like it. They hate it when I say that we’re rounding the turn. And they always use Europe. “Oh, look at Europe. Look at Europe.” Well, take a look at Europe. Look at how they’re doing. And their economy is in tatters, and they have a lot of problems, and we don’t want that. We don’t want that. And that should have never happened. Should have never happened. That should have never been allowed to happen.(02:10:07)
Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state. He’s looking you in the face and he’s locking you in your home while letting rioters, Antifa, the radical left, run down your streets, riot in your streets, burn down your stores, beat you over the head, and they’re allowed to do that. But you can’t go to your church. You can’t have dinner with your family, but you’re allowed to protest and riot. That’s why I call all of these protests, because we’re allowed to protest. You’re not allowed to meet and you’re not allowed to pray together, but you’re allowed to protest, so I call everything that we do a protest. The Biden lockdown will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Easters, no Christmas, no 4th of July, no future for the youth. Other than that, it’s actually quite good.(02:11:11)
A vote for Sleepy Joe Biden is a vote for lockdowns, lay offs, and misery. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, by the way, he would have been so far behind on a vaccine. He would have been so far behind. He did the swine flu. It was the joke of … They didn’t know what the hell they were doing. Now he’s saying, ” He should have acted faster.” Except when I did the ban on China, he said I shouldn’t do it for two and a half months. Then he admitted he wrong too, and then he runs, and now he’s saying I should have acted. I was so early in doing that ban, and we saved … And our biggest critic admits that we saved thousands and thousands of lives by doing it. Thousands of lives. And the ventilators that were made, and all of the things that we’ve done, and all of the medicines that are coming out. And here I am-(02:12:03)
… all of the medicines that are coming out and here I am, right? Here I am. And I’m sure it had nothing to do with the medicine. I used to sort of give the medicine a little bit of credit, now I give it none, because I’m a perfect physical specimen, and I’m a very young person. I’m a very young person. I said that, of course, a little bit sarcastically. I said it a couple of weeks ago. I said, “No, no, I’m better than perfect. I mean, it was very quick, very easy because I’m in perfect physical shape and I’m a very young man,” and CNN went crazy, “He is not in great shape, and he is not a young…” But they went totally crazy. They are definitely, seriously losers.(02:12:46)
Could you imagine if they had a cover of sleepy Joe for four years, their ratings would tank. That’s why football is not doing well. First of all, they’re not going to do well, basketball was down 71%, their finals. You know why? Because our people want to see people that respect our country, respect our anthem and respect our flag.(02:13:12)
And football is way down. But you know, they’re down for that reason, but they’re also down because people would rather watch this stuff than watch football, because this is much tougher. They consider this to be much tougher actually. But can you imagine if they covered sleepy Joe, the ratings are phenomenal for all of these things. And then they cover sleepy Joe, their ratings would tank. They would come to see me, “Sir, I think it’s really important that you run again because we are losing our networks, our ratings are down the tubes.” The failing New York Times will definitely be out of business very quickly. They used to write nothing about me, now I average probably about four or five stories a day on the front page. Someday they’re going to give me a good one, watch. It might be tomorrow. We got to have a big win. We want a big win, not just a wave, we want a big win. Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates said about Biden that he was wrong on nearly every single major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. He’s been wrong on everything. He’s been wrong on everything. But don’t believe me, because you’re Michigan, I spent all of this money on these beautiful, very large television sets. I call them beautiful, large screens. They’re large television sets. Let’s see it for yourself, okay. Go ahead.2:14:41)
Joe Biden. Joe Biden. Joe Biden.2:14:53)
Have you taken a cognitive test? (02:19:19)
Thank you very much. Look, you can’t let this happen to our country. Okay? We know what’s going on. You can’t let this. This was a total fluke. This was a total fluke. In prime time he didn’t work and now it’s really not working. What a disaster. I can’t believe this is even happening.(02:20:05)
It puts much more pressure on me running against a guy like this. You lost to somebody that was good, can you imagine the concept of losing to this guy? You better get out there and vote tomorrow. I will be so angry I will never come back to Michigan, I’ll never come back. I’ll tell Japan to bring all those plants they held back.(02:20:31)
Joining us tonight are some great warriors, great people. Congressman Bill Huizenga. Bill, where is Bill? Thank you very much. Everything good? You’re doing great. Thank you, Bill.(02:20:49)
Congressional candidate, Peter Meijer. Peter, where’s Peter? Where’s Peter? Peter, you don’t have a good location. What happened to Peter? Peter’s here someplace and I hear he’s doing great.(02:21:03)
House Speaker, Lee Chatfield. Lee? Thank you, Lee, great job you’re doing.(02:21:12)
RNC Chair, I’ll tell you what a job she did. What a job she did. Ronna McDaniel. Where are you Ronna?. What a job she’s done. We won this great state with her leadership. Thank you, Ronna, very much, great job.(02:21:34)
State GOP Chair, Laura Cox. Laura? Good job. Are we going to win? Otherwise, we will fire you so fast.(02:21:53)
No, I think we’re going to have a tremendous victory in Michigan. I think we’re going to have a tremendous victory in all of these States they’re talking about, I see all of them. We’re going to have a tremendous evening, I hope so. For the good of our country, I hope so. You see the alternative, I’m sorry. But this is not just an alternative. We’re doing a great job, but we want to keep it going. Okay. We got to keep it going and we’re going to.(02:22:18)
A very special person. Medal of Honor recipient, Jim McCloughan. Jim, where are you? Great job. He’s a very brave one. Thank you very much, Jim. Congratulations, that’s a great honor. Our highest honor.(02:22:36)
Ted Nugent, and he is great. Where is Ted? Great job, Ted. He’s been from day one, right, Ted? Great job. Thank you very much for everything. I appreciate it. I love your sound. I love your music. And speaking of sound, music and other things, one of the big superstars of the world, Little Pimp. There he is. How’s it going? Do you want to come up and say something? Come on. Lil Pump, come on up here, come on up here. Does everyone know who he is? You know how big he is? Come on up here. It’s a nice hat. Come on, say something.:23:32)
Hello everybody, how are you guys feeling? I’ve come here to say, Mr. President, I appreciate everything you’ve done for our country. You brought the troops home and you’re doing the right thing. MAGA 20, 20, 20, don’t forget that. Don’t forget that. And do not vote for sleepy Joe, at all.(02:23:58)
Thank you/ That’s great, thank you very much, I appreciate it. That’s very nice. Big star, big star. That’s very impressive.(02:24:29)
For 47 years, Joe Biden viciously attacked black Americans. He called young black men, super predators. To every black American, I am asking you to get out tomorrow and vote. This is your one and only chance. Thank you. Thank you, man. Thank you very much. To show Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to jail you, to betray you and I’m fighting for you and you know what we’ve done? What we’ve done is really something that nobody thought could have happened. Other administrations, in particular, the last administration didn’t make even a move to try and get it done. We got criminal justice reform done. We got prison reform done. We got opportunities zones all done and complete. Tim Scott. We had funding for historically black colleges and universities completed and done, and it’s an honor to have done it. And I say it all the time, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, no president has done as much for the black community as President Trump. And I’m very proud of that, very proud of that.(02:25:54)
Thank you. It’s been an honor. It’s been an honor. Biden has vowed to increase refugee admissions from terrorist nations by over 700%, including from Syria, Somalia and Yemen. The Biden plan would overwhelm your communities and turn Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the entire Midwest into a virtual refugee camp. I am keeping radical Islamic terrorists, if you don’t mind, the hell out of our country.(02:26:25)
And if you take a look at France over the last week, they’re having a devastating problem. Another problem happened today, a very big problem in Europe and we don’t want it. We don’t want that problem. We don’t need it. We don’t want it. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States military, biggest investment we’ve ever made. We are the envy of every country, militarily, Russia, China, North Korea. Everybody looks at what we have, nobody. Tanks, F35s, super fighter jets, tankers, submarines, missiles, rockets, hypersonic missiles, they go seven times faster than our fastest missile, fastest in the world. All of the things we’ve done in our nuclear plants and our nuclear capability is now at the highest level and it’s all in tippy top shape. And you just have to pray to God that we’d never used it. That’s all we say. Pray to God that we never use it.(02:27:34)
We have the best in the world, all by the way, made in the USA and made a lot of it made right here in Michigan. A lot of it made right here in Michigan. We also passed VA veterans choice and veterans accountability, VA accountability. 91%. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani is dead. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, had been working on that for 52 years.(02:28:24)
And instead of endless wars, we are now forging peace in the Middle East, and we’re getting it done. It’s going to happen very quickly, you watch. A vote for me and The Republican Party is a vote for the American dream. And remember, Abraham Lincoln was a proud member of The Republican Party, Abraham Lincoln.(02:28:47)
In conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all, which is already taking place. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment. Which is under siege, but it’s 100% secure with us in this position, Mike, right? We will never touch it.(02:29:32)
We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which goes into effect on January 1st, bigger than healthcare. Lower drug prices even more. We have signed and done something that’s never been done on prescription drug prices, favored nations. It will bring drug prices down 50, 60, 70%, like you’ve never seen before. And the drug companies, big pharma, does not exactly like your favorite president, I will tell you, but that’s okay. We broke a log jam. Favored nations, nobody thought we’d ever do that, we did. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That’s starting very soon.(02:30:37)
We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Michigan.(02:31:20)
Tomorrow, you have the power, with the power of your vote, but you have a power to save America, for this country will never be a socialist nation. We will never allow that to happen. Together we can finish the job and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. Nobody knew it was so deep and so vicious, but we have done some job. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and get out and vote. Most important election perhaps in the history of our country. I never thought I’d say that. After what we went through four years ago, I said, “There’ll never be anything like that. Never be anything like what we went through.” And this is the most important election, maybe in the history of our country, from Midland to Mackinac, from Pontiac to Battle Creek and from Detroit to right here in Grand Rapids, I love Grand Rapids.(02:32:27)
We inherit the legacy of American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country, our families, and our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. The best is yet to come.(02:33:04)
Proud citizens like you, who helped build this country, together we will take back our country. We’re taking it back at a level that nobody has believed. We are taking it back and we are winning and we’re going to win tomorrow. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God and together with the incredible people of Michigan, we have made America powerful again. Our military, it’s never been like this. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Michigan. Go out and vote. Thank you very much. Thank you."

It is my profound honor to address the United Nations General Assembly 75 years after the end of World War II and the founding of the United Nations, we are once again, engaged in a great global struggle. We have waged a fierce battle against the invisible enemy, the China virus, which has claimed countless lives in 188 countries. In the United States, we launched the most aggressive mobilization since the second world war, we rapidly produced a record supply of ventilators, creating a surplus that allowed us to share them with friends and partners all around the globe. We pioneered lifesaving treatments, reducing our fatality rate 85% since April. Thanks to our efforts, three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials. We are mass producing them in advance so they can be delivered immediately upon arrival, we will distribute a vaccine. We will defeat the virus. We will end the pandemic and we will enter a new era of unprecedented prosperity, cooperation and peace.(04:37)
As we pursue this bright future, we must hold accountable the nation, which unleashed this plague onto the world, China. In the earliest days of the virus, China locked down travel domestically while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world. China condemned my travel ban on their country. Even as they canceled domestic flights and locked citizens in their homes, the Chinese government and the World Health Organization, which is virtually controlled by China, falsely declared that there was no evidence of human to human transmission. Later they falsely said people without symptoms would not spread the disease, the United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions. In addition, every year, China dumps millions and millions of tons of plastic and trash into the oceans, over fishes other countries waters, destroys vast swaths of coral reef and admits more toxic mercury into the atmosphere than any country, anywhere in the world.(05:48)
China’s carbon emissions are nearly twice what the US has and it’s rising fast. By contrast, after I withdrew from the one sided Paris Climate Accord, last year, America reduced its carbon emissions by more than any country in the agreement, those who attack America’s exceptional environmental record while ignoring China’s rampant pollution are not interested in the environment. They only want to punish America and I will not stand for it. If the United Nations is to be an effective organization, it must focus on the real problems of the world. This includes terrorism, the oppression of women, forced labor, drug trafficking, human and sex trafficking, religious persecution, and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities. America will always be a leader in human rights. My administration is advancing religious liberty, opportunity for women, the decriminalization of homosexuality, combating human trafficking and protecting unborn children. We also know that American prosperity is the bedrock of freedom and security all over the world.(07:04)
In three short years, we built the greatest economy in history and we are quickly doing it again. Our military has increased substantially in size. We spent $2.5 trillion over the last four years on our military. We have the most powerful military anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close. We stood up to decades of China’s trade abuses. We revitalize the NATO Alliance where other countries are now paying a much more fair share. We forged historic partnerships with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to stop human smuggling. We are standing with the people of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom. We withdrew from the terrible Iran nuclear deal and imposed crippling sanctions of the world’s leading state sponsor of terror. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, killed its founder and leader Al-Baghdadi and eliminated the world’s top terrorists Qasem Soleimani. This month we achieved a peace deal between Serbia and Kosovo.(08:17)
We reached a landmark breakthrough with two peace deals in the middle East after decades of no progress, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain all signed a historic peace agreement in the White House with many other middle Eastern countries to come. They are coming fast and they know it’s great for them, and it’s great for the world. These groundbreaking peace deals at the dawn of the new Middle East, by taking a different approach, we have achieved different outcomes, far superior outcomes. We took an approach and the approach worked. We intend to deliver more peace agreements shortly, and I have been more optimistic for the future of the region. There is no blood in the sand. Those days are hopefully over. As we speak, the United States is also working to end the war in Afghanistan. And we are bringing our troops home. America is fulfilling our destiny as peacemaker, but it is peace through strength.(09:16)
We are stronger now than ever before. Our weapons are at an advanced level like we’ve never had before, like frankly, we’ve never even thought of having before. And I only pray to God that we never have to use them. For decades, the same tired voices proposed the same failed solutions, pursuing global ambitions at the expense of their own people. But only when you take care of your own citizens, would you find a true basis for cooperation. As president, I have rejected the failed approaches of the past, and I am proudly putting America first, just as you should be putting your countries first. That’s okay. That’s what you should be doing. I am supremely confident that next year when we gather in person, we will be in the midst of one of the greatest years in our history, and frankly, hopefully in the history of the world. Thank you, God bless you all. God bless America. And God bless the United Nations."

Hi, perhaps you recognize me? It’s your favorite president. And I’m standing in front of the Oval Office at the White House, which is always an exciting place to be. I got back a day ago from Walter Reed Medical Center. I spent four days there, and didn’t have to, I could’ve stayed at the White House, but the doctors said, “Because you’re president, let’s do it.” I said, “Fine. You tell me what to do, and I’m going to listen.” These are great professionals. They’ve done a fantastic job.(00:27)
And by the way, not only at Walter Reed, all over the country, we have the greatest doctors in the world, we have the greatest nurses, the greatest first responders, law enforcement, by the way, incredible, firefighters, everybody. They’re just great. We have great people. This is a great country.(00:43)
But I spent four days there and I went in and I wasn’t feeling so hot, and within a very short period of time, they gave me Regeneron. It’s called Regeneron, and other things too. But I think this was the key, but they gave me Regeneron, and it was like, unbelievable. I felt good immediately. I felt as good three days ago as I do now.(01:05)
So I just want to say, we have Regeneron. We have a very similar drug from Eli Lilly and they’re coming out and we’re trying to get them on an emergency basis. We’ve authorized it. I’ve authorized it. If you’re in the hospital and you’re feeling really bad, I think we’re going to work it so that you get them and you’re going to get them free, and especially if you’re a senior, we’re going to get you in there quick. We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready.(01:33)
I have emergency use authorization, all set, and we got to get it signed now, and you’re going to get better. You’re going to get better, really fast. This is things that nobody even thought of a few months ago. The job that the scientists, the labs, everybody has done is incredible.(01:49)
Then in addition to that, you have various other drugs that help a lot. But I view these, I know they call them therapeutic, but to me it wasn’t therapeutic, it just made me better. I call that a cure. So I want to get these things done. So we have to get them done. We have to get them approved, and I want to get them to the hospitals where people are feeling badly. That’s much more important to me than the vaccine.(02:13)
But on the vaccines, we have many companies that are in final stages for the vaccines, Johnson & Johnson. Moderna, Pfizer, all great companies, but many of them, and we’re going to have a great vaccine very, very shortly. I think we should have it before the election, but frankly, the politics gets involved and that’s okay, they want to play their games. It’s going to be right after the election, but we did it. Nobody else, nobody else would have been able to do it.(02:37)
The FDA has acted as quickly as they’ve ever acted in history. There’s never been a time and no president has ever pushed him like I pushed them either, to be honest with you. But the FDA is approving things in a matter of weeks, that used to take a matter of years. So we have these drugs, Eli Lilly, and the others that are so good.(02:58)
But they are, in my opinion, remember this, they’re going to say that they’re, “Therapeutic.” And I guess they are therapeutic. Some people don’t know how to define therapeutic. I view it different, it’s a cure. For me, I walked in, I didn’t feel good. A short 24 hours later, I was feeling great, I wanted to get out of the hospital and that’s what I want for everybody. I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your president because I feel great. I feel like perfect.(03:27)
So I think this was a blessing from God that I caught it. This was a blessing in disguise. I caught it. I heard about this drug. I said, “Let me take it.” It was my suggestion. I said, “Let me take it,” and it was incredible the way it worked. Incredible. I think if I didn’t catch it, we’d be looking at that like a number of other drugs, but it really did a fantastic job.(03:51)
I want to get for you what I got and I’m going to make it free. You’re not going to pay for it. It wasn’t your fault that this happened. It was China’s fault, and China is going to pay a big price for what they’ve done to this country. China is going to pay a big price for what they’ve done to the world. This was China’s fault, and just remember that.(04:10)
So we’re going to get you the drug. It’s going to be free. We’re going to get it into the hospitals as soon as you can, as soon as we can. And you’ll see some amazing things happen because we have … our military is doing the distribution. It’s called logistics, and they deliver, hundreds of thousands of troops in a matter of days. This is easy stuff for them.(04:31)
Our generals are all ready, we’re waiting for the emergency use authorization and the drug companies have just made a lot of it. So hopefully this is going to be not just a therapeutic, it’s going to be much more than a therapeutic. You’re going to get better. You’re going to get better fast, just like I did. So again, a blessing in disguise. Good luck."

Oh, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And considering that we caught President Obama and sleepy Joe Biden, spying on our campaign, treason, will probably be entitled to another four more years after that. I wanted to thank you, and Art and Brandon, you’re incredible. I’ve known you now a long time. Right from the beginning, we had the chemistry, we had that good chemistry… Oh, sit down. It’s 122 degrees in this place. And we have our great Governor. Governor, can we make it a little bit, just a little. This is like a test. You think Joe Biden could do this? I don’t think so.(03:07)
So I’m thrilled to be in Yuma, Arizona To proudly accept the endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council, that’s a big deal. And they are great friends of mine. And we’re building the wall. Next week, we’ll be up to 300 miles of incredible wall. And our numbers are the best. We are very tough at the border. When people want to come in, for our farmers, et cetera, et cetera, we’re not going to hurt our farmers, but we’ve never had better numbers than we have right now. And that’s been helped because we’re at a little bit over 280 miles right now, we have never been helped like this. Wall, there are two things, in a thousand years you can come back, two things will never, with technology it’s obsolete before you even put it in the box, but two things never get old wheels and walls. Wheels and wall. If you come back in a thousand years, you’ll say, “Well, we still have wheels in walls.” And that’s the only thing you’ll recognize.(04:15)
The National Border Patrol Council is the official union representing the incredible heroes of the United States Border Patrol. They’ve been my friends from the beginning. To every border agent, and I just met some unbelievable people backstage, these are great people, and every family member here today, you have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation. And I want to thank you very much. Thank you very much. As you know, better than anyone, the survival of our nation is at stake in this election. And I will tell you, I never thought I’d say it because we had a great election. We had a great election a little while ago.(04:59)
Four years ago, I never thought I’d say anything could compete with 2016. This election that we’re going into is the most important election in the history of our country, because we had crooked Hillary, but this is something, these people are sick. And we have to make sure that this radical left socialist and beyond, because this is beyond socialism, that it doesn’t happen, or we will indeed have Venezuela on steroids. So we can’t do it. Most important election, November 3rd, get out and vote. Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left wing movement that seeks the complete elimination of America’s borders and boundaries. They want to take the wall down, they don’t want to have borders, they want to have sanctuary cities, lots of bad things they want. Following orders from his boss. I guess his new boss is Bernie Sanders. Can you believe that? Crazy Bernie.(06:09)
Joe Biden has pledged to abolish immigration enforcement, suspend all removals, provide free government healthcare, and they want to give it to illegal aliens. You don’t get it. Restore, catching and release. Shield violent criminal aliens. This is what they want to do. And give every illegal alien on the planet earth a free ticket to invent an asylum claim, and gain automatic admission into our country. We will have people coming into our country that never even thought of it before. You get free education, you get free healthcare, why wouldn’t they come? Let’s go to America. The Biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen. It’s crazy. Biden’s plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous, and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate. It must be defeated, and it will be defeated on November 3rd. It will be defeated.(07:24)
At last night’s Democrat convention, which by the way, got very bad ratings, I have to tell you. Unity. They talk about unity. They want to bring unity. And then you listen to Michelle Obama’s speech, which was obsolete by the time it got there. She taped it. No, she taped the speech. It was obsolete. She must have taped it about three weeks before. I’m speaking next Thursday, maybe I’ll tape it. But I don’t think that goes. That’s so much nicer, to tape it, you do it, nice air conditioned room. And she not only taped it, but tell me when you hear a divisive speech… They talk about me as being a divider. I’m not a divider. I bring people together. We were bringing people together. We were bringing people together, like never before. Success was bringing everyone together, and then we got hit with the China virus, but we were bringing people together.(08:26)
But one of the opening speakers last night said that America will go to hell if we don’t have open borders. Think of that. Go to hell. When a country doesn’t have borders, you don’t have a country. Today, a Democrat speaker at the convention said, “We’re talking about abolishing the police, we’re talking about abolishing ICE, we’re talking about abolishing prisons.” Biden’s campaign has turned into a cult for open border and others Zealots. By the way, they want to double and triple your taxes, they want to increase regulations, they want to spend very little money on our vets, after we took care of our vets better than anyone’s. 91% approval rate. And they want to spend much less on our military, we’ve totally rebuilt. Two and a half trillion dollars, we’ve totally rebuilt our military.(09:26)
Bernie Sanders declared, in his speech, many of the ideas that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream. That’s Bernie Sanders. Because Joe, he doesn’t know where he is. But if he did, he’s been brought so far left that our country will not be the country that we know. It will have problems, it will go down. Your stocks will be gone, your 401ks will disappear. And right now, who has the 401k? And then the rest of you, many of you have stocks, and you do it a different way. That will go down 50, 60, 70%, 80%. And if you held on, like I said to do, we went down a little while we got hit with a virus. Now, NASDAQ just broke an all time record. SNP, just broke an all time record.(10:26)
Socialism is the mainstream of the Biden campaign and it’s not the mainstream of America. Remember I said, we will never have a socialist country. On November 3rd. The people of Arizona, our great state, we love Arizona. I won it last time, by a lot. And I hear we’re going to win it by even more this time. Don’t forget, last time I talked, I said we’re going to give you a tax cuts, I gave you. I said, we’re going to give you a massive regulation cuts.(11:03)
Give you your tax cuts, I gave them to you. I said we’re going to give you massive regulation cuts, we’re going to give you great everything. We even did Right to Try medicine. You know all about that. We did things that I didn’t even talk about it, we did. We did a thing called the Space Force. You never heard me talking about. I’m the only candidate that gave you more than I promised in the campaign. It’s true. I’m the only one ever, maybe ever. Or we’ll head to the polls and together we’ll stop the left and win four more years in the White House. We’re joined today by some incredible people, friends of mine, great, great people. And I want to congratulate your governor because we had a spike and he knocked that spike out so fast. I don’t know. Are you sure you even had a spike? Doug Ducey, a great governor, great man, and a somebody that won by about 16 or 17 points. That’s not so bad. And I think you’re more popular today. What a job you’ve done. Thank you very much, Doug.(12:02)
A friend of mine and somebody who’s a great fighter pilot, and I had a lot of people tell me she could really wheel the Warthog, right? The Warthog. She said, “I love that plane,” but she was a great, great fighter pilot, one of the best they were telling me. This was a group and they knew a very well. A lot of friends you have. And specifically she said, “Could you extend that plane? That’s the best plane. It never breaks down. It just is a winner.” But Martha McSally is an extraordinary person, and she’s fighting for us, and she’s helping us, and we have to bring her into the center. Thank you, Martha.(12:43)
And she’s running against a gentlemen who is, when you read what he’s done, when you read what he said about the second amendment and about all other things, you’re not going to want to vote for. You’re not going to want to have them play with your second amendment. I’ll tell you what. If I weren’t President, I don’t believe, Doug, you’d have a second amendment right now. I don’t think you’d have. The pressure that was put on to get rid of it, or to basically obliterate it, make it so it’s meaningless. You will always have the right to bear arms. You will always have that.(13:20)
A few friends of mine who are warriors. Paul Gosar. Paul. Where’s Paul? Paul, stand up. Will you? Paul Gosar. Thank you, Paul. Appreciate. Great job you’re doing. These are warriors. They really are. When they went and they tried to make a play at your President, they had to get through the House. What were we? 197 and nothing. That’s never happened before. Everybody came together. The Republicans came. Other than Mitt Romney, one half a vote. One half a brain.(13:52)
Another friend of mine and incredible fighter, and somebody that loves his state, and I’ll tell you, the Freedom Caucus, right? And we have a man named Andy Biggs here. He’s a fighter. He’s a fighter. And he loves our vets, and he loves our military, and you love our second amendment, right? And we’re not going to do anything with it. They will destroy that second amendment. Just remember I said it, but you’re not going to have to worry about it because it’s not going to happen.(14:23)
A woman who really distinguished herself, she became a star. She became a star overnight. There was nobody tougher. There was nobody smarter. There was nobody better than Debbie Lesko. Great job, Debbie. Thank you. We want her on our side. Right fellas? We got to have her on our side. Also, thanks to Arizona Republican party chairman, I knew this was going to happen. I knew that she was going. She never stops. She never gives up. Kelly Ward. Kelly, thank you. Thank you, Kelly. Great job you’re doing. Are we winning?e winning.(15:10)
Okay, good. I think we are. That’s what they say. We better win. If we don’t win, this country is in big trouble. Big trouble. Also a great friend of all of ours, former State Treasurer of Arizona, Jeff DeWitt. Thank you Jeff. And a man who didn’t choke under pressure. I don’t even know if he’s here. I think he might be here. He never choked. He kicked for 11 years. You know what that is? You ever see a golfer. They miss a three footer. They miss a three footer. They can’t take it back. They choke, choke, choke. Well, kickers are the same. Right? NFL kickers. This guy lasted 11 years. He’s one of the best kickers ever. NFL kicker, Jay Feely. Where’s Jay? Where is Jay? He’s here someplace. Where is he? Jay? What happened? You couldn’t get a good seat, Jay. I remember the 61 yarder. That was a heartbreaker. Right? But the only thing is, I’ll bet you this man would stand, only stand, for our National Anthem. That’s one thing. That’s one thing I can tell you.(16:25)
And if they don’t stand for our flag, if they don’t stand for our National Anthem, I turn off the game. Other than that, I’d like to watch, but I turn off the game. And by the way, I thought they learned that lesson a little while ago. I thought they learned that lesson two years ago, but maybe not, but they will. They’ll learn it again. This time it’ll go even faster.(16:45)
For decades, Washington politicians like Biden allowed an endless supply of illegal foreign labor to decimate American jobs and wages. Also, the crime was incredible what happened. They allowed criminal gangs to menace, maim and terrorize innocent citizens. They came in. They would maim and terrorize, and we have done something with our border patrol. And by the way, ICE, ICE is great. ICE has taken out thousands and thousands of MS-13, and you don’t want the job. There’s some tough people here. None of you want the job. It’s a tough job, but they like it, and they’re great Patriots, and they’ve done a fantastic job. They ceded control of the border to the most dangerous and ruthless cartels on earth. This is what would happen. They have ceded. And what we’ve done, did you ever notice the caravans? What happened? Debbie, there are no more caravans. What happened? What happened to the caravans? They don’t come up anymore. The caravans don’t come up.(17:52)
You know, we were paying hundreds of millions of dollars to Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, hundreds of millions. And I said, “Well, why are we doing that?” And they wouldn’t take. When we caught a murderer and we wanted to bring it back to one of those countries, they wouldn’t take him. And they wouldn’t take him under the Obama administration. So we got stuck with them because they’d fly in. They’d say, “Don’t land your plane.” And I said something very simple. I said, “That’s okay. We don’t have to do that. We’re not going to pay you anymore. We stopped payment.” We stopped payment. It’s amazing how that works, Doug. Right? We stopped payment and they called. They said, “We’d love to take them. We’d be honored to take them.” So we take them back by the thousands, by the thousands. They let lethal poisonous drugs pour freely into our schools and our communities, but no more. It’s not happening anymore. The cruel and heartless portrayal of the American people ended the day I took the oath of office, and now that we have more than half of the wall built, and do you notice they don’t talk about the wall anymore. They don’t talk. Why don’t you talk? I went, “Look at all those people back there.” That’s called fake news, fake news. Look at them. It’s the fake news.(19:22)
They don’t talk about the wall anymore. See, we won. We got the wall. It’s going to be up to 300 next week and it’s going to be finished very soon. And as soon as we want, all of a sudden, they never talk about it. But you know where I talk about it? Numbers. The numbers are so good. The numbers are so low. We’ve never had numbers like this because that big portion of wall already built, you don’t get through it. You can’t get through it. You can climb Mount Everest, and you’re going to have an awful hard time getting over that sucker.(19:55)
I stood up to the lobbyists. Everybody fought us, the Democrats, everyone. I fought the special interests. I kept every single promise that I made, and now I’m doing it with the drug companies. I just created Favorite Nation. So if a nation buys it for less and they buy it for a fraction of what we pay, the drug companies have to sell it to us for the same price. And they’re spending so much. They’re spending millions of dollars on advertising. Anytime you see an ad from a drug company, and they’re rich, the farmer, it’s called Big Farmer, the number one lobbyist. They spend millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars online. Anytime you see, anytime at all, you see an ad by Big Farmer against me, you know your drug prices are coming down. That’s what it is. They’re not happy.(20:46)
And we’re giving the rebate that creates tremendous wealth for the middle man, the rebate. It’s going to the people now. We’re bringing the rebate and it’s going to the people. They are not happy. I have a lot of people in that industry do not like me too much. But you are going to get 50. You are going to get, and the Democrats would never do it, Biden would never do it because he doesn’t understand it, but they would never do it. They would in a million years, they wouldn’t do it. It took a lot of guts to do it. I had a lot of people, a lot of good politicians go, “Sir, I don’t think you should do it.” I wonder why you’re saying that, but we did it. We’re going to have drug prices reduced over a very short period of time, by not 2%, and last year they went down a little bit, first time in 51 years that drug prices went down but a little bit, we’re going to have prices dropping 50, 60, and even 70%. Drugs. About time.(21:44)
And I’m proud to say that they’ve achieved the most secure border, our border patrol, in the history of the United States of America. We now have the most secure border we’ve ever had and it’s only going to get better. And we want people to come in, but we want them to come in through merit, right? And we want people-(22:03)
… people to come in, but we want them to come in through merit, right? And we want people that are going to come in and are going to love for our country, not hate our country. Here in Yuma, Arizona, we’ve invested over $1.7 billion and poured 180,000 cubic yards, that’s a lot of concrete, to build 108 miles of powerful border wall. I know who’s going to vote for me. I don’t know though, I think I’m going to win Yuma. What do you think, Doug? I think, when I hear those numbers, when we hear those numbers, we’re winning. We’re going to win Yuma big. Now you see it and you see what’s going up and it’s an incredible structure, all capable, all wired up for cameras, for everything you can have. Technology is incredible.(22:47)
In total, I’ve already completely planned for the final execution, we’re going to have, by the end of the year, everything that we said is going to be built. We may actually build some more in some soft areas that we’ve noticed over the last two years. So we actually may put up some additional, but we will have it completed, everything we said, by the end of the year and nobody thought that was possible.(23:20)
And we’ve reduced illegal border crossings by 60% since this time last year. And if we keep going at the rate, it’ll be about 85% in about two months. So it’s a great honor. And you know what? Your community is much safer, you see the difference, it’s a much safer place to be. But more important than these numbers is the fact that we’ve ended catch and release. You know what catch and release is? These great men and women catch somebody, maybe a murderer, maybe a rapist, maybe a trafficker, they catch somebody, take his name, take his number and they release them into our country. And they say, “Come back in four years, you have a trial.” No more. We take them out. We bring them out. And nobody said that was possible because I couldn’t have gotten it through the Democrats because they don’t like that.(24:11)
So we have people coming in to this country, some great people, some really bad people too. And I mean murders and I mean rapist, I mean really bad people and they don’t get in and they don’t get back. When we bring them back to their country, could be Mexico also, they don’t come back. Under the Obama Biden, I call it OBiden, Under the OBiden administration, our agents were ordered to ignore the law and release illegal aliens by the hundreds of thousands. And by the way, Mark Morgan, where’s the great Mark Morgan? He’s around here someplace. Mark Morgan has been so incredible, one of our executives, he said, “We never built the cages. Those cages were built in 2014 by Obama.” We never the cages, they were built by Obama and the fake news is constantly saying that I built cages for children. I didn’t build them. They were built in 2014.(25:09)
There was a headline in Time magazine about the cage and somebody called in that built it. They said, “He didn’t build it, we built that for the Obama administration.” But they don’t stop, they keep calling it, they say I built the cages. You’ll hear it in one of the debates. They’ll say, “You built cages president.” I said, “No, I didn’t build cages. That was built by Obama.” Under the Trump administration, if you cross our border illegally, you are quickly apprehended and swiftly returned back home.(25:41)
We are proudly defending the job safety and security of the American people, which is what I promised to do. Nobody told me it was going to be this hard. Nobody told me I was going to have the Democrats go totally crazy. This was like a life and death war. You know why they don’t talk about it anymore? Because they know it’s bad politics, because they know having a wall, they can’t win that one. So they just say, “Let’s forget it ever happened.’ Because we won and they say, “Let’s forget.” They don’t want to talk about it. That includes the millions of incredible Hispanic Americans who follow our laws, uplift our community and protect our nation, in uniform. Half of all border patrol agents are Hispanic Americans, I was just with them. And today I salute each and every one of those true American heroes and that’s what they are.(26:39)
And nobody understands the border better than Hispanics. They know what’s good, what’s bad. They don’t want bad people coming into our country, taking their jobs, taking their homes, causing crime. Hispanic Americans are the people that are most in favor of what we’re doing on the border because they understand it. They understand it better than anybody. With the help of these patriots, we’ve stopped the rampant asylum fraud, shut down the human smugglers and we’re finding the drug dealers, traffickers, predators, and we’re throwing them to hell in jail or sending them back home.(27:24)
MS-13, for the first time that you’ve ever seen this, MS-13 is totally on the run. Many of its leaders are right now behind bars and we’re deporting its members in record numbers we’ve never reported. I can’t believe how many there are. But if Biden wins, it will be a giant jail break for MS-13 and vicious criminal gangs. China wants him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. When we win, I’ll have a deal with the red within a month, watch, because they’re dying to make a deal. But that last hope that Biden will win, they will own our country, China, they will own our country. We made such a great deal. Last week they had the largest order of corn in the history of our country, the largest single order. Then they did it again. You know why they’re doing that? Because they know I’m angry, because they know I don’t care so much anymore. We made a great trade deal, but I don’t care.(28:29)
But it shows you how smart they are, Doug. Another with normal brain power, they’d say, “Well, I’m not going to buy any more corn.” That’s good. And we’ll just decouple, thank you very much. But they go the opposite. They buy so much, good record numbers, soybeans record numbers. Last week, biggest ever, 42% of our farmers crop is now China, over the last little while. You know why? Because they don’t want bad things to happen, that’s why. So they’re very smart. When I have every farmer in the country calling and saying, “Please don’t do anything.” They’re very, very smart, but we can never forget what China did to this country and did to the world.(29:15)
The historic achievements that I’ve discussed today are only a slim fraction of the extraordinary accomplishment that we’ve all done together in the last four years. Here’s just a short list of our landmarks. Really they are landmarks, true landmarks. We instituted a national security travel ban on the world’s most dangerous regions, including jihadist regions, keeping terrorists and extremists out of our country. Everyone said, “Oh, that’s so bad.” Remember when they said, “Oh, that’s so bad.” I don’t think it’s so bad at all. We won the travel ban. The fake news said we didn’t because we lost in the lower court, we lost in the second court and we won in the Supreme court. So they said we lost. Can you believe it?(29:58)
They said we lost Debbie, because we lost the first two, but we won in the Supreme court, so they said, “They lost.” I guess, technically they’re right, we lost when it didn’t matter. But we have it. We have a great travel ban now for countries that are not countries where we want the people coming in. Over the last three years, ICE officers have made over 380,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of over 145,000 assaults, 40,000 sex crimes and 5, 800 murders. Over the last three years, border patrol and ICE have seized over two million pounds of fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other deadly narcotics. And you see it all the time.(30:51)
We stripped federal grant funding from deadly sanctuary cities. They want to have a sanctuary city, not going to be like the old days. We canceled the lawless policies of the previous administration and empowered border agents and ICE officers to do their jobs and proudly enforce the laws of the United States of America. We removed 20,000 gang members, including 4,500, MS-13. That’s pretty good. Who would ever think there’s that many? I entered into three landmark agreements with Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala to end the abuse of the asylum system. We cut down that payment that I was talking about substantially and they’re still very happy and they are working with us very well and that includes Mexico.(31:44)
Right now, Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on our Southern border, helping us to guard our Southern border. And we’re giving you the tools to do the job that you signed up for. That’s what we’ve done. I entered into a historic partnership with Mexico, known as the migrant protection protocols, to safely return asylum seekers to Mexico, while awaiting hearings in the United States. You know about that. We had to have them in the United States and we captured them, we had to keep him here. I said, “No, no, we don’t want them here. We want them outside.” We got sued all over the place that we won. So now they don’t come into the United States, they can wait outside. For the first time ever, the United States is now exercising our full legal authority to expedited removal. We don’t have to go through years and years of litigation. You need Perry Mason to try and win. We ended the Obama Biden policy of giving work permits to newly arriving, illegal aliens. Think of that one. We established the national vetting center, the most advanced visa screening system, anywhere in the world. We know so much about the people coming in. We know the good and we know the bad. We’ve suspended refugee.(33:03)
… Good and we know the bad. We’ve suspended refugee resettlements from the world’s most dangerous regions, because nothing is more important than keeping America safe. To me, that’s number one. We’ve made historic progress to crack down on visa overstays. You know all about that. They overstay for years. They say, “Maybe a night, maybe two nights.” Well, five years later, you catch them. No, we ended it. We issued strict sanctions on countries that failed to take back their own criminals. We have many countries beyond the four that I mentioned, the three plus one, many countries. They all take them back now. Before, they weren’t taking them back at all. The last administration simply released these criminals. We’re making sure they go home and we’re making sure they stay home. We don’t want them.(33:53)
We issued regulations to stop the horrible practice of birth tourism. You know what that is, right? Anchor babies, you know that, right? Anchor babies. Have a baby in our country and you stay for the rest of your life. Congratulations. You’re a citizen for 90 years. Then you bring in your family. You bring in your family, right? No. No good. I implemented a historic public charge regulation to finally and fully enforce the federal requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient, they cannot accept welfare for at least five years.(34:30)
To protect our country and our agents during the pandemic, my administration took immediate action to ensure the safe and rapid return of all illegal aliens. We brought them back. We have very few in our country now. We brought them back, can you believe it? To protect US workers, I suspended the entry of low wage workers that threatened all of your jobs, American jobs, and we’re finalizing the new H-1B regulations to permanently end the displacement of US workers.(35:05)
In January after the China virus, after the outbreak, after the outbreak, the China virus outbreak, it came from Wuhan, right? I swiftly implemented a travel ban on China and I was criticized. Biden, opposed the ban. He said, “I oppose the ban.” He had no idea what the hell he was doing. Why do you oppose it, Joe? I don’t know. They told me to say that. If we had listened to Sleepy Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional American lives would have been lost. We did a good thing. That was in January, I imposed it, very early.(35:43)
A month later, Pelosi and all these people said, “Oh no, let people come in. We can’t.” We imposed it because China was heavily infected. Then I imposed it in Europe also, heavily infected with Italy and France and Spain. Compare our achievements with the insane and lethal policies that Biden and Bernie Sanders want. The entire Biden… Harris. How about her? Is she a great one? Is she? By the way, you talk about guns. She wants no 2nd Amendment. She wants to raise your taxes to a level you’ll be paying your government back for a long time. She is not the right pick, but she was my number one draft pick. They asked me that.(36:28)
Why do you think? I said, “I’m very happy.” They thought I was happy. They thought I was happy for him. No, I was happy for me. The Biden-Harris plan is a step by step recipe for abolishing America’s borders. In the Biden, Bernie manifesto, Joe Biden, promises to restore and expand catch and release across the entire US border. You believe that? We just got rid of it. Free all illegal aliens from federal detention and close detention facilities, this would make removing illegal aliens totally impossible, and you would have murderers, killers, rapists in your midst. I don’t think so.(37:11)
Immediately suspend all removals, triggering a tidal wave of, really a flood, if you think, a flood all across our border. End prosecution of illegal border crosses ensuring that illegal aliens will repeatedly reenter the country over and over again and terminate all protections we have enacted against asylum fraud. They want to do things that nobody thought was even possible to contemplate.(37:41)
Now, this is all simple and I really respect because so far I’ve only seen about four or five people go down. Because it is hot in here. But I will tell you this… It’s 120. You know what I said before? Think of yourself at a great spa, great sauna, where it’s 120 degrees and we have to pay a lot of money to be there. You have to pay a lot of money. Getting off the border, getting off illegal protection, all of that, we are going to lower your taxes further. We gave you the biggest tax decrease in the history of… The biggest tax decrease in the history of our country. We decreased your taxes more than anybody has ever done and we’re doing more because that’s going to spell growth and that’s what happened.(38:29)
Companies are moving in like nobody has seen before. So we’re doing that. Massive additional regulation cuts. We’ve cut regulations more than any president in the history of our country, whether it’s four years, eight years, or in one case, more. I told you already, our military is the best it’s ever been. It’s got $2.5 trillion worth of new, beautiful jets and equipment and rockets and everything. Hopefully, we never have to use it. Our nuclear arsenal, and hopefully, hopefully we never have to even look at it, our nuclear arsenal is at a level that it’s never ever been before, and we have to have it there, but we never want to use it.(39:18)
So we have done things not only on the border, the border is one element, and to me it’s very important. Something that they always say about a president, the most important thing a president can do is the appointment of federal judges and supreme court justices. So by the end of our, of not my, our first term, we will have appointed 300 federal judges and appeals court judges, and two supreme court justices.(39:55)
When it comes to 2nd Amendment, when it comes to life, when it comes to a lot of things that you people live for, if you don’t have the supreme court and if you don’t have the courts in your side, you can forget it. The next president, I think, will pick two, three, or even four justices of the supreme court. They can be on the court for 40 to 50 years. You pick them young. They could be on there for 40 to 50 years. This is going to be the most consequential presidency. This is going to be the most important, and I never thought I’d say it because of what happened four years ago, this is going to be the most important election of your life. So I just want to…more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.(40:58)
Thank you.more years. Four more years.(41:02)
I just want to say stay healthy, stay sharp, be careful. Be very careful. Go out and work like hell. We need every single vote that we can get because it’s probably going to be close. I always assume it’s going to be close. They have these suppression, the fakers back there, they have the suppression polls where they interview many more Democrats than they do Republicans. Doug and I were talking about it and they take out registered voters. It’s not registered. They say, “Most likely to vote voters.” That’s what, most likely registered, they’re dead, they’re old, they’re not going to go, they’re not going to do anything. Be careful with your ballots, but get out there.(41:45)
November 3rd is the biggest date, one of the biggest dates in your life, in many cases, frankly, it’s the most important date of your life. One other thing we’ve done lot. We’ve gotten rid of a lot of nonsense from Obama, like the Paris Accord that costs us tens of billions of dollars and gave us nothing. We’ve gotten rid of so many different things that you have no idea, but you know what? If we don’t win, they can put it back, and with the things that we did put in, which are many, many, many things, many things, our military, our vets, everything, with all of the things that we put in, it’s like a tree, it takes a little while to grab on. You transplant it. It’s got to grab on.(42:29)
If we have four more years, there’s nothing that they can do. Our country is sailing. our country is sailing. So Yuma, thank you very much. Arizona, thank you very much. Thank you for all your support. We love you. We will never ever let you down. We will never let you down. Governor, thank you. Martha, go out and win. Go out and win. Vote McSally. Thank you everybody."

So we have a list of about 45 people, and it was set up over a period of time, a long period of time, in conjunction with a lot of other people that are very talented, conservative, but very talented people. And it was definitely a time for a woman. And so I had, I broke it down into five women, and this is a person who is just outstanding. A great student, a great scholar. Her professor, one of the most notable and actually the, probably one of the most respected at Notre Dame said that Amy was the best student that he ever had. He was there for many years. The best student. So that meant something because academics means something to me. And I’m just, I think it’s going to be really thrilling. I hope it goes smoothly. Perhaps it will, perhaps it won’t. I think it’s going to be very hard to dispute her qualifications or anything about her. (01:35)
Well, I’ve been very happy that the two people that we put on. It’s a very proud moment for a president to make choices. And if you look at Justice Gorsuch, or Justice, Kavanaugh, they’ve been just outstanding people, outstanding men. And it was time for a woman. I think I knew. I mean, there was thought of it last time, but I thought that at that time, Judge Kavanaugh, was Judge, was just very outstanding. And I just felt that this was the right time. I did consider her at that time, but when this happened with Justice Ginsburg, when this happened, this just seemed like a natural fit. (02:28)
No, specifically I didn’t do that because in theory you, it’s nicer if you don’t. I guess you have no, you could talk about anything you want, but I just really got to know her a little bit, a little bit the last time. And when this was happening, in the process of happening, I called her and I said, “I’d like to have you come down.” And it just worked out very quickly and very well. I didn’t discuss certain concepts and certain things. And some people say you shouldn’t, I don’t see any reason why you shouldn’t, but I decided not to do it. And I think it gives her freedom to do what she has to do. She has to make rulings. But I think she’s going to make a lot of people, very proud. There’s also, there has been, I noticed there’s a tremendous clamoring for her. The public really, I’ve been seeing it. We’re all human, and I’ve been seeing it. There was a tremendous feeling that she was somebody that was going to be picked. I didn’t tell anybody, but a lot of people felt she was going to be picked. (03:37)
Right. (03:55)
So I didn’t think it was for me to discuss that with her, because it’s something she’s going to be ruling on. And this is what I was told, although I would have had the right to do that. But if you look at her past actions and rulings, I guess she maybe would be in the category that you mentioned. I don’t know. I can say this, that she is certainly conservative in her views and her rulings. And we’ll have to see how that all works out, but it will work out. (04:32)
It’s certainly possible, and maybe they do it in a different way. Maybe they’d give it back to the states. You just don’t know what’s going to happen. But I’ve been surprised. I’ve been surprised by some of the rulings that we’ve already had over the last year. You think you know somebody and then you get rulings that are a little bit different than you think could happen. So you never know what’s going to happen. Mostly, I’m looking for somebody that can interpret the Constitution as written. We say it all the time. And she is very strong on that. And it will be very interesting.(05:06)
Also our Second Amendment. I feel I know what she’s doing on Second Amendment, but I can’t really speak for her. And again, I’m picking a person. She’s going to have to rule the way she feels. But the Second Amendment is under siege if Joe Biden got in, in any way, if he would have, because I can’t imagine if that’s going to happen, but your Second Amendment is going to be gone. And it’s going to be gone quickly, I think. So we can’t let that happen. But they’ll probably be ruling on Second Amendment and various other things. They say it’s the most important thing a president can do. I don’t know if that’s true. I mean, I would say military. You might agree with me on military protection. (05:49)
But they say the selection of a Supreme Court Justice is the most important thing. And the other thing, by the end of the term, we’ll have almost 300 federal judges and court of appeals judges, which is a record. So we will have had a great impact on the court system going forward. (06:20)
Yeah. It’s such a great question. It’s just, you can’t answer it. But I do believe that in a way, Justice Kavanaugh was a pioneer. What he went through was so horrible. False accusations, and he’s such a gentleman the way he handled it, but nobody was, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anybody for any position treated the way he was treated. And so viciously by Harris and all of them. The way they spoke to this man was so horrible. And I actually think it makes it easier for Amy. I think they can’t do that again. They can never get away with it. Nobody’s ever been treated so badly as Justice Kavanaugh, at that time, Judge Kavanaugh. I will say this, Judge Gorsuch, at the time Judge Gorsuch, he was treated pretty tough. Got through it strongly. He did a great job. But the way Judge Kavanaugh was treated was, I’ve never seen. I’ve never seen anything like it. I’ve seen some bad treatment. I have never seen anything like that. I think that makes it a lot easier for Amy. (07:43)
I don’t know if they can hold back, but I think they don’t look good if they go crazy again. They went crazy. They went, what they did was crazy. And we had a couple of people that weren’t real fighters on our side. And they’re gone. They’re gone. I wonder where they went, but they’re no longer with us, and that’s a good thing. We have, I think we have great, the Republican Party is very united in this. Lindsey Graham, every one of our members, they’re tremendous. Mitch. We speak all the time. (08:24)
Well, we worked very closely together and it’s been pretty amazing. Look, we have, there’s never been anything like it. If you think, again, by the end of, we have 40 or 50, we have many people in there waiting to be confirmed right now for federal judgeships. That’s a big deal. A federal judgeship. And don’t forget, President Obama left us over 100. It’s unheard of. He left us over 100 because he probably thought that Crooked Hillary who was going to win. And in which case it wouldn’t have mattered too much. I guess that’s what he assumed. But he left us a lot. So we will have a record. And that’s a, very record, that’s a very important record. Again, judges and justices, especially justices of the Supreme Court. And to think that I’d have three in one term. (09:20)
Well, the only way they can do that if they win the presidency and they have to win the Senate. And I’ll tell you, I think we’re doing really well. There’s a great hidden majority. I call it hidden, you can call it a silent majority, but it’s not really silent. It’s very, you see the rallies. Our people showed up last night in Virginia. We’re looking at Virginia very strongly. We think Virginia is in play and you saw the people that showed up last night. We had probably 35,000 people show up at an airport on a short notice. So we think there’s a lot of things going on out there that, much more so than even four years ago. Four years ago, you knew it better, you saw it early Pete, but four years ago we had tremendous enthusiasm. It’s much more now. It’s much more this year. (10:06)
I would like to. I would say we have plenty of time, just in case your next question would be, well, should you wait? They wouldn’t wait, number one. And importantly, we have a lot of time. We also could go after. We have tremendous amount of time. And it’s been done many times before this way. It’s an election year. No, I think we’re going to have it done easily before the election. I think it would be nice to do, get it out of the way. It’s so important a decision. I think it’s important. We’re going to try to have it done quickly and before the election. But think of all the time. So then you have, from that day, you have all the way to January 20th. So I mean, who would not do this? They say, well, why don’t you wait for the next? Well, elections have consequences. And we won the election. We have the Senate. We have the presidency. So I think, I think she’ll be confirmed before, and probably long before the election, relatively long before the election. (11:07)
I think I prepare every day. I think when you’re President, you sort of see everything that they’re going to be asking and they may disagree with you, but we’ve done a great job. We created the greatest economy in history and there’s never been, from an employment standpoint, from every standpoint, and now it’s coming back. We closed it. We saved millions and millions of lives by doing what I did. And now we’re bringing it back. It’s a V. It’s a V-shape, which is, it’s maxed out. I mean, we’re setting records on employment and everything else. Even the stock market. Look how high the stock market is. And we’re rounding the turn. They hate when I say that, the opposition, but we are. We’re rounding the turn on the pandemic. And very incredibly, we have some of the great vaccines, great companies, and we’re going to have different vaccines, very powerful vaccines, great vaccines and therapeutics, but this is all happening very, very soon. So we’re in great shape, but we built the greatest economy in history, and now we’re doing it again. We’re doing it rapidly. And I think next year, we’re going to have a great third quarter, by the way. And next year I think is going to be one of the greatest years we’ve ever had on the economy. And it’s going to, it’s really very exciting, actually. (12:20)
Thank you very much. (12:22)
Thank you very much, Pete."
trump_Laura_interview.txt,"(00:03)
Thank you. (00:28)
Well, these are terrible and very incompetent people. Portland’s been burning for many years, for decades it’s been burning, but now it’s gotten to a point they don’t want to do… I watched the Mayor try and get in with these people. And he went to a protest and he went in there. They almost killed him. If he didn’t have security, whatever he had, five security guards, he would have been dead, just like they would have done to Rand Paul, who’s a great guy, and his wife, Kelly. It is a disgrace. When you look at what’s happening. Now, we sent in Homeland Security. The reason we sent them in was to protect our courthouse. We have a $300 million courthouse, and they wanted to blow up our courthouse or burn it down. “Take your choice, blow it up, or burn it down,” they said, and I said, “No, no, that’s not happening.”(01:13)
So they wouldn’t protect it, because the Mayor said he doesn’t care. So we sent in our Homeland people, they did a great job. Homeland Security. Immediately, it was protected. And that’s the only reason they were there. I’ve offered to send in the National Guard. I’ve offered to send in anybody they want. I could put that out in 45 minutes and it would stop. And I think the people of Portland and the people of Oregon, I know it’s a liberal state, considered liberal. They’re tired of it. They’re tired of living with this curse. They’re living with a curse. They say that when you walk through the streets of Portland, this is years and years of burning and it’s not- (01:57)
It’s been horrible the last 90 days. But no, it’s been going on for many… It’s been going on for many, many years. It’s like, you’re in, I won’t name the city, but it’s the city someplace in the world that’s not so good, okay? It’s a terrible situation. (02:21)
Right? But they won’t ever criticize anybody that truly, that’s a violent person, frankly. That’s violent. They stick up for the violence. The people that are getting hurt, they don’t care about. They don’t care about these people. It’s a weird thing. It’s like warped minds. And for the last 93 days, I’ve been offering to send in… And as you know, they have to take the offer. They have to ask to have help. I’ve been standing and I’ve been saying, “Anytime you’re ready, we’ll put it out.” (02:51)
I think it’s a sickness, actually. I think they’re are also, there’s a fear. I watched the way they treated this Mayor Wheeler when he was standing there. And I’ll tell you how unfair the news is. NBC news didn’t show that he was being shouted at and cursed at. And he ran, literally he had to run for his life, because they were going to really hurt him. He had security. If he didn’t, he would have probably- (03:16)
How he can still stick up for them. I think there’s a fear. I think he’s afraid. (03:26)
I don’t know. No, I think that like the Mayor Wheeler, I think he’s probably afraid for his life. Because if you would have seen him… But I’ll show you, had this on NBC news put on and they didn’t have the people shouting, they had him standing there, and they talked about how it was a show of great unity. The mayor standing with the people. Those people were going to kill him. They were saying things that I can’t repeat right now, but horrible things. But they didn’t put that on. I actually happened to see the real tape on Fox. He escaped with his life, and yet he doesn’t want any help. It’s so unfair to the people of Oregon. We could solve that problem quickly. Like I did in Kenosha. You know, Kenosha went through three or four days of that. You wouldn’t have a Kenosha right now. We demanded that they send in the National Guard. Called the governor. And in all fairness, the governor did it. Not enough, but it was enough to put it out. And we ultimately put in where we had 1,000 people and we put it out quickly. You wouldn’t have Kenosha right now. (04:54)
Look, he’s a weak person. He’s been weak all his life, but now he’s really weak. He shouldn’t be running for president. He should not be there. (05:09)
No, I don’t want them to. I want to leave it to law enforcement. But my supporters are wonderful, hardworking, tremendous people. And they turn on their television set, and they look at a Portland or they look at a Kenosha before I got involved and stopped it. Or they look at Chicago, where 78 people were shot last week and then numerous people died. Or they look at New York where violence is up by like what, 150%? It’s up by a number that nobody… And people are leaving. They’re looking at all of this and they can’t believe it. They can’t believe it. Whether it’s my supporter or not. (05:48)
Well, it’s a peaceful protest. I mean, they were protesting. They weren’t… You know, it’s amazing. They want to protest and they get criticized. The other people run through the streets, burn down storefronts, hurt people, beat people and kill people, kick people in the face. That would have happened to Rand Paul, by the way, and his wife, except that you had two, and then ultimately four very good policeman, who took a big beating. They took a big beating and they really saved Rand Paul. In fact, we’re going to bring them into the white house and give them some kind of an accommodation because they really… What they did was very brave, actually. I mean, can you imagine? I’m saying policemen were brave because they were escorting, but they’re escorting a US Senator and his wife. And as Rand said, he would have been killed if they weren’t there. It’s a terrible- (06:44)
Sure.: (06:44)
If you see anybody from that cabinet, you get up and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.(06:58)
Please, get up in the face of some Congress people.7:00)
There needs to be unrest in the streets.(07:02)
The domestic enemies to our voting system and our honoring our constitution are right at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, with their allies in the Congress of the United States.(07:14)
It’s not only the Democrats, it’s the media, the fake news. The news is so fake. Like I told you with the mayor, where they make them look like it’s a great unity thing, when actually they were cursing at him and they would have done big numbers on him, but they don’t show that. They just show the mayor standing with these very tough thugs and he was gone. Okay? They saved him. But NBC shows it like it’s unity with the people. I don’t get it. I don’t know why they’re doing it. And I will say this. At some point I will not be President. Hopefully that’ll be in five years from now, but I will not be President. And they’re going to die. They’re all going to die. Can you imagine if they had to cover sleepy Joe Biden, it won’t be very much fun. But much more importantly, our country would go to hell. Our stock markets will crash, as sure as you’re sitting there. We will have problems like you’ve never had. But if you take Kenosha and if you take other parts of the country that I don’t even talk about, I could show you things that we’ve done to stop this kind of a thing that’s happening in Portland, and happening in Chicago, and happening in other places. (08:36)
So if it weren’t Donald Trump’s America, to just use the expression as I’m president, you would have riots like you’ve never seen. The Democrats have lost control of the radical left. And if you look at Bernie and the, I call it the manifesto that was agreed to with Biden and his crew, that’s further left than Bernie ever was. They won’t be able to control these people. These people have lost control of these people and it’s hurting them. Don’t forget, Biden wasn’t going to come out of his basement until the election. Now he had to because the polls are so good for me. Now he had two because the polls are different. So all of a sudden he’s in Pittsburgh. He wasn’t going to leave his basement. Then he said, “Okay,” he’s leaving. But he won’t leave for 10 days. 10 days is a long time. So in the meantime, like on Sunday, or Saturday, I’m in Texas, I’m in Louisiana. I was going to stop in two other places. Fortunately, they didn’t get hit. Arkansas wasn’t hit very much, et cetera, et cetera. I would have stopped. But I’m all over the place. I leave early in the morning. I get home late at night. And that’s what you have to do as president Joe doesn’t have energy. (10:02)
Because I am a tremendous fan of law enforcement and I want to thank the law enforcement. They’ve done a good job. And when the governor says that I shouldn’t come or he’d prefer that I not come, I’m the one that called him and said, “Tony, you got to bring out the National Guard.” “Well, I don’t really want to do it.” “Tony, you got to bring it out.” And unlike your governor of Oregon, that just keeps saying no, he agreed to it at least. Now he agreed to a small number, but the small number was plenty. (10:36)
Oh, that’s true. That’s true. If you look at what’s going on in, as you call it, blue state America, blue city America. You look at what’s going on in New York. You look at what’s going on in these states. Chicago is a disaster. Portland. You look at Portland. Now Portland’s a little different. That’s anarchists. And I actually think in many ways that’s easier to handle. I think Portland is very easy to handle, because that’s a group of anarchists that are paid by the outside. And you know, we put a lot of people in jail. I don’t know if you know this or not. You remember three, four months ago, we were having a problem with monuments? They were ripping down statues and monuments [crosstalk 00:00:11:10]. (11:10)
Oh, the Democrats had no control. It actually got out of control even for them. I signed in an executive order, 10 years in jail if you knock down a statue or monument. You haven’t heard one thing about it. You haven’t. We wouldn’t have… They were going after Thomas Jefferson, they were going after Lincoln. And they were going after the Washington monument, that they could knock that one down. They were going after it. And I actually don’t even think they know. I think they’re just thugs. I don’t think it’s… It may be an ideology and it may not. It is an ideology for the people that are paying them. And the funny thing is, and the strange thing is, the people that are paying them and all this money, because somebody’s doing it [crosstalk 00:11:49] The people paying them, those people will be overthrown. Their lives will be taken away. Their lives will be endangered. They’re all going to be gone. They’re just stupid foolish people that made a lot of money. (12:14)
Because they’re weak people led by weak people. In many cases, not all corporations. (12:19)
I looked at numbers where one company is giving hundreds of millions of dollars. (12:24)
Because they just do what’s the easiest path. That’s not the easy path. That’s a very dangerous path. Black Lives Matter is a Marxist organization. You remember pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon. That was the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter. I said, “That’s a terrible name. It’s so discriminatory.” It’s bad for black people. It’s bad for everybody. And all of a sudden it becomes like, sort of… Although now if you look, it’s gone way down, because people are tired of this stuff, what’s going on. The Black Lives Matter. If you look at what’s going on with the bats and a lot of thugs. (13:00)
Oh, it’s terrible, what’s going on. But Black Lives Matter came into existence, walking down the street, screaming, “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.” And that was about police officers that was representing police. They were pigs, pigs in a blanket, like the sausages or hot dogs, fry them like bacon. (13:20)
I think even worse, yeah. Probably. [crosstalk 00:13:23] I don’t know, do you get worse? (13:38)
We have them all. (13:48)
So they have under investigation a lot. In fact, I’ll show you. I just had this, because of this very important interview with you. But I just… And I’ll give this to you. In Kansas City, violence has decreased by a third since the initiative began. In Indianapolis, 49 guns confiscated. More than 1000 arrests have been made under the initiative. DOJ is addressing violence and crime across the country. But you don’t read that. The FBI and ATF are assisting the Portland police department, but you can’t do much when you have absolutely no cooperation. (14:34)
Biden won’t calm things down. They will take over. They will have won. If Biden gets in, they will have won. He’s a weak person. He’s controlled like a puppet. So it’s not going to be calm things down. It’s going to be, they will have won. They will have taken over your cities. It’s a revolution. You understand that, it’s a revolution. And the people of this country will not stand for that. They’re not going to stand for that. The vast majority of people feel like me. They feel like… Every time I put law and order up on social media, it gets such an incredible positive response. The people of this country will not stand for it. If you say calm things down. Yeah. Calm things down, because they will have taken over. Take a look at what’s going on. And Biden… Well, Biden is, I don’t even like to mention Biden, because he’s not controlling anything. (15:24)
People that you’ve never heard of. People that are in the dark shadows. People that are- (15:32)
People that you haven’t heard of. There are people that are on the streets. There are people that are controlling the streets. We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend and in the plane, it was almost completely loaded with thugs wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms with gear and this and that. They’re on a plane. (15:54)
I’ll tell you sometime, but it’s under investigation right now. But they came from a certain city, and this person was coming to the Republican National Convention. And there were like seven people on the plane like this person. And then a lot of people were on the plane to do big damage. They were coming [crosstalk 00:16:12]- (16:12)
Yeah, this is all happening. (16:17)
Money is coming from some very stupid rich people, that have no idea that if their thing ever succeeded, which it won’t, they will be thrown to the wolves like you’ve never seen before. (00:06)
Yep. (00:10)
Well, that’s what they said last time, too. (00:26)
Okay. I have to be aggressive because I’m like standing here in a sea of incompetent people, stupid people, and violent people. Very violent. (00:40)
That’s okay. (00:40)
It’s also the kind, well … Where are we? Oh, we’re in the White House. I see. See. Okay? So I’m standing here in a sea of people, and we need law and order in this country, and women see that with me. You’re never going to have law and order with Biden. Hey, look at Ferguson. Look what happened during the … You know, people forget. Look at all of those horrible race riots you had during Obama. Ferguson’s just one that comes to mind. But you had them all the time. Look at all of what happened with Brown and this one and that one. Look at all of the problems you had under Obama. It was a disaster. It was actually worse than anything.(01:16)
This is a much different situation. Again, the anarchists in Portland are different than what’s going on in Chicago. Chicago can be solved. I think it’s actually a little bit more difficult to solve. I think the anarchists, in many ways, are much more solvable, but for women, more than anything else, they want security. They want safety. They have to have safety. They talk about the suburban woman. What I did recently, I ended the regulation that provided low-income housing, that mandated low-income housing- (01:49)
That was the Obama rule. It was a disaster. (01:55)
Oh, yeah. We already- [crosstalk 00:01:56] (02:00)
I know the suburbs, look … Westchester was ground zero, okay? For what they were trying to do. They were trying to destroy the suburban, beautiful place. The American dream, really. They wanted low-income housing, and with that comes a lot of other problems, including crime. May not be nice to say, but I’ll say it. [crosstalk 00:02:18] (02:19)
No, I’m not saying that at all, but it does … There is a level of violence that you don’t see. So you have this beautiful community in the suburbs, including women, right? Women. They want security. I ended where they build low-income housing project right in the middle of your neighborhood. I ended it. If Biden gets in, he already said, it’s going to go at a much higher rate than ever before, and you know who’s going to be in charge of it? Cory Booker. That’s going to be nice. Okay. So I think that women are going to want me, well, for a lot of other reasons. The stock markets will crash. As sure as you’re sitting there, your 401(k)s will go down to a small percentage of what they are- (03:03)
He’s going to do $4 trillion in tax increases. He’s going to do things that are going to cost so much on the Green New Deal, which is done by a child. Okay? That’s the mind of a child. Because the Green New Deal is ridiculous. It doesn’t work. They’re going to do things under the Green … You know, the Green New Deal, if you actually did it, is $100 trillion. That’s more money than this country could make in a thousand years- (03:32)
Let’s rip down a building and build a new one with no windows. Okay? (03:53)
I’ve done criminal justice reform. I saved the historically black colleges and universities. What they went through was, for years, including Obama- (04:02)
Prison reform, criminal justice reform. (04:05)
Opportunity zone. More of the same. And in fact, I actually said in the speech, the best is yet to come. And I’ve been treated very well, at least in the polls, I hope. I hope that translates because, unfortunately, the African American, the Black community, has been so used to going and pressing the Democrat lever, and what have they got out of it? They’ve got nothing. Obama didn’t give them criminal justice reform. I did. Obama didn’t give them opportunity zones. I did. Obama didn’t do all of the things, didn’t save … Obama could have saved the historically black colleges and universities. He didn’t do anything for them. He didn’t do anything for them. I’ve done more.(04:45)
And I said in the speech, some people would say, you shouldn’t say it. It’s too aggressive. I said, what’s aggressive? I’ve done more than any president in the United … in the history of our country, except for maybe Abe, and I say maybe, maybe, Abraham Lincoln. The reason I say maybe is I’ll explain that to you later. Okay? (05:03)
Wait a minute. I’ve done more for the Black community than any president in the United States with the exception of Abraham Lincoln. And it’s true. Criminal justice reform was such a big deal, and look what Biden did in 1994, what he did to people, to Black people. (05:23)
Well, he called them predators. (05:25)
Super predators, actually. He called them super predators. (06:03)
What the Black community wants in this country is they want police, and they want law and order. They don’t want what’s happening to their communities. They’re being affected in a much harsher, meaner matter than anybody else. That includes Hispanics, who aren’t doing very well, also. Look, they want law and order. They want the police. They do polls, and the polls are at 82, 83%. They want the police. They’ve gotten along with the police, and the police have been very badly mistreated because you have one bad apple, and it becomes a story for weeks. (06:40)
Oh, yeah. Dorn- (06:47)
Yeah, that’s true. Yeah. That’s true. Killed. (06:54)
The police are under siege because of things … They can do 10,000 great acts, which is what they do. And one bad apple, or a choker, you know, a choker, they choke. Shooting the guy. (07:08)
Shooting the guy in the back many times. I mean, couldn’t you have done something different? Couldn’t you have wrestled him? In the meantime, he might’ve been going for a weapon, and there’s a whole big thing there. But they choke. Just like in a golf tournament, they miss a three-foot- (07:27)
I’m saying people choke. (07:30)
People choke, and people are bad people. You have both. You have some bad people, and you have, they choke. You could be a police officer for 15 years, and all of a sudden you’re confronted. You’ve got a quarter of a second to make a decision. If you don’t make the decision and you’re wrong, you’re dead. People choke under those circumstances, and they make a bad decision. I’ve seen bad decisions of people that, it looked bad, but probably it was a choke. But you also have bad police, but you also … The vast, not only the vast majority, thousands and thousands of great acts, and one bad one, and you make the evening news for weeks. (08:22)
The call is being made, as I understand it, yes. (00:25)
Well, once you get to a certain number, we use the word herd, right? Once you get to a certain number, it’s going to go away. So, it doesn’t have to be. But yeah, I mean, a lot of people are not going to want to do it. A lot of people don’t want to do the flu vaccine. (00:40)
You know, I never had the flu, but I never had a shot. I never had the vaccine. I come here, the first thing is, sir, you have to have a flu shot. I said, “Why?” “Because you have to have it.” I say, “What’s the percentage? And I wasn’t thrilled with the percentage, it’s like 50%, 55%.” (01:01)
Well, I said, look, if I’ve never had it, wouldn’t it be good? And then I thought I should have it because I’ll set an example. So I had it. So I’ve had it now three times, and I still haven’t had the flu. So maybe I’ll give credit to the flu vaccine. I don’t know. (01:15)
If I can say this. I think we’re going to have a vaccine very soon. A lot of tremendous work has been done. We’re going to have a vaccine, just like we have therapeutics, which to me are even more important. You go into the hospital, you make people better. That’s to me the most, and we just did the convalescent plasma, I think. And you have other things too. So I think we’re going to have a lot of therapeutics and we’re going to have a vaccine very soon as to whether or not people take it- (01:48)
You add 35 to the people that have had it. And to all of the other things. People that have had it, where in theory, you can’t get it, although they found one person and they’re making a big deal. One person got it twice. But if you add it all up, it gives you very good protection. (02:10)
Yeah. (02:11)
Well, I think it’s a very dangerous statement for him to make. Look, we did the right thing. We shut it down and now we built it up and we’re setting records on job numbers. We’re setting records on retail numbers. So this guy comes in, I heard it the other day, if they said, so that means that if some doctor said we have to shut it down, we’re going to shut it down. We’re setting records. By the way, the stock market is at an all time record right now. You look at what’s going on in the stock market. Look at what’s going on. We’re going to have a phenomenal year, next year. We’re going to have a great third quarter. Interestingly, the numbers for the third quarter will come out before the election. (02:49)
So what happens- [crosstalk 00:02:47]. (02:50)
Well, I can tell you what is happening. Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to give any stimulus. We should have it. It wasn’t the people’s fault that China gave us this virus. China gave us the virus. Whether it was through incompetence or on purpose. (03:08)
Well, I always tell her to go back to San Francisco, take care of your homeless problem. Take care of your problem in California. Because there’s nothing like what I’m witnessing out there. Right outside, right where she lives right in her district is so bad. Needles all over the place- (03:23)
Well, we should have. We’d like to get it for the people because it wasn’t their fault, but she doesn’t want to give it because that will make the economy a little bit better and that would be a terrible thing. (03:42)
I get along with him very well. I disagree with a lot of what he said. He said, “Keep it open for China.” That was a big mistake, and he admits it. I get along with him, but every once in a while, he’ll come up with one that I say, “Where did that come from?” I inherited him. He was here. He was a part of this huge piece of machine. I didn’t put anybody in charge. He was here. He’s been here for 40 years. (04:05)
Okay. He’s been here for many, many years, but you inherit a lot of people. It’s part of the machinery and you have some you love, some you don’t. I like him, I don’t agree with him that often, but I like him. (04:29)
Yeah. (04:46)
It’s been different because I’ve accomplished so much. On the military, I’ve accomplished, first of all I’m bring in many of the troops home and most of the troops home, even cutting down Germany. Okay? Because they’ve taken advantage of us like you wouldn’t believe. But it’s been different for a lot of different reasons. I think primarily because I’ve accomplished so much."

Thank you very much and that was some greeting we had in North Carolina, I’ll tell you, I don’t know if you saw the crowd outside but it’s pretty amazing but we’ve had it in Texas and Ohio and South Carolina, Florida, it’s just incredible what’s happening. Please sit down. Please, and I’m honored to be in North Carolina in the presence of true American heroes as we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the American victory in World War II and a victory it was.(00:30)
On September 2, 1945, the great General Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan’s unconditional surrender aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. VJ Day marked the end of the deadliest conflict in human history and the ultimate triumph of American freedom. It was a big day. It was a great triumph, a great country, and our country is greater than ever before. That’s what’s happening and that’s what it is. Greater, with a greater military. With a great military than we’ve ever had before.(01:08)
We’re deeply moved to be joined this afternoon by World War II veterans all of whom I’ve met, all of them are tough. I don’t want to mess around with any of them, I’ll tell you right now. Whose blood, sweat, grit, courage and unfailing devotion made that epic victory possible. These brave Americans raced into the fires of hell to vanquish tyranny, dethrone fascism, and defend the American way of life. You’ve earned the eternal and undying gratitude of all Americans and that’s why I’m here today. I wanted to be with you. You know what I’m talking about, don’t you? We had a good time a little while ago, right? Over at the Oval Office, Congressional Medal of Honor.(01:54)
We’re privileged to be joined as well by veterans from every generation including a number of wounded warriors. We stand in awe of your service, I can say that, so respected, so loved, we are in awe. Joining us for this commemoration are Secretary David Bernhardt, Secretary, where’s David? Thank you David very much for being here. A great senator, a real friend of mine, a tremendous senator actually, he works very, very hard and he loves the people of North Carolina, Senator Thom Tillis, Thom, thank you very much. And some warriors, they’re in Congress and they’re tough and they’re smart, Representatives David Rouzer, Ted Budd and Dan Bishop, thank you fellas. They are tough, but you’re not as tough as these guys, I’ll tell you right now, right? You’re not as tough as them. There’s no better place to mark this profound World War II anniversary than right here in Wilmington, North Carolina. The people of this city and this state and it’s an incredible state and I want to thank you for being so nice to me. You’ve been very nice, very, very nice every time we’ve asked for something abut I’ve been nice to you also, I have to say that, but you made the extraordinary contributions to the war effort, that’s North Carolina, made this extraordinary contribution and so many, nearly two million American servicemen trained for combat in North Carolina.(03:26)
More than any other state, wow, that’s pretty good, isn’t it? Who would know that. Two million trained, more than any state. Over 360,000 service members from your state fought in the Second World War. They battled on the cliffs of Normandy, over the skies of Africa, and in the deep waters of the Pacific, over 11,000 North Carolina patriots fought the enemy until their very last breath. You know what that means, right? Think of that, 11,000 died in the war. We want to thank you, boy, and we have family members here by the way, that’s them saying hello.(04:09)
In Wilmington, more than 20,000 workers of the North Carolina Shipbuilding Company poured out every ounce of their strength to build an astonishing 243 ships for the U.s. Navy and it was the citizens of Wilmington who came together to save a priceless artifact of American history, the glorious battleship behind me, the USS North Carolina and that is some powerful and beautiful ship. Coming in, we got plenty of televisions on Air Force One, and they showed it in primetime in the 40s and they showed that ship and I’ll tell you, I shouldn’t say this, they don’t make them that way anymore. They really don’t. What a beautiful ship.(04:53)
During World War II, this magnificent ship participated in many major naval offenses and in the Pacific theater itself, including the Marshall Islands, Iwo Jima and Okinawa earning more battle stars than any other battleship. We’re learning a lot today, right? That’s pretty good. Why are you clapping? You come from West Virginia. He loves West Virginia, so do I, right? But we’re clapping anyway, right? You better believe it. Thank you.(05:25)
After the war the people of Wilmington organized a massive campaign to save this beautiful ship from the scrapyard. They preserved it as a memorial to the gallant deeds of American sailors, a monument to the American workers that built it and an enduring symbol of American greatness. Now more than 200,000 people visit the site each year to learn the history and the heroism that defines our nation. This afternoon my administration is formally recognizing the city’s exceptional contributions to victory in the Second World War. It is my tremendous honor to officially designate Wilmington, North Carolina as our nation’s very first World War II heritage city. That’s a big deal, our nation’s very first, Wilmington. Congratulations to you all.(06:23)
God is saluting you up there, I tell you. We may have to go a little quicker than I thought, right? With this designation, we proudly declare that in America we don’t tear down the past, we celebrate our heroes. We cherish our heritage, we preserve our history and we build a future. This mighty vessel and this magnificent town will forever tell that story with this designation so I want to just congratulate North Carolina and Wilmington. That’s a fantastic, a fantastic thing.(06:54)
I want to thank Senator Tillis and Congressman Rouzer, stand up please, in between the lightning bolts, for their work to make this day possible, thank you Thom, thank you fellas, great job. Let me also thank retired Navy captain Wilbur Jones who has championed the cause of World War II heritage cities. Wilbur, thank you. Thank you Wilbur. Great job. Great job. So Wilbur, you know a lot of people wanted this, right? So you are just a tough cookie. You got it. Number one, number one in the nation. I want to thank Wilbur, that’s great. I also want to recognize several of the heroes who saved American freedom and I’ve known some of them since I’ve been in office, I’ve seen them. There they are, here today is my good friend who I just left and he was in the Oval Office with me at the White House, Woody Williams. 75 years ago, Woody showed fearless courage as a Marine in the Battle of Iwo Jima. You are amazing. I promised him I would not tell that he’s 97 years old, I promised. I’ll tell you he’s 100% sharp. He’s 100% sharp, I know a 78-year-old that’s not so sharp and he’s 97 and he’s 100% because it has nothing to do with that. 78 is young. Depends who’s 78, that’s all.(08:26)
He’s 97, I said, “Man you are something,” and physically in great shape. He braved a torrent of hostile fire while destroying one enemy machine gun position after another, knocked them out, one after one for his daring actions. President Truman, think of that, awarded Woody the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest in our land. Woody, congratulations. You inspire us all. It was great to have you on Air Force One. I have promised him maybe two years ago, I said, “I’ll take you on Air Force One.” He came up, he’s very aggressive. He said, “I’d like to fly on Air Force One,” I said, “I’ll do it,” and today we did it, right? We got it done. Thanks Woody. Great job.(09:07)
Also joining us today is Paul Phillips, a veteran of World War II, Korea and Vietnam. During the Second World War Paul proudly served on the USS North Carolina in the Pacific theater. At 93 years old, he has returned today to visit the ship upon which he nobly served. He’s a tremendous man. Paul, it’s our honor to have you with us. Please Paul, stand up. Thank you Paul. Thank you. Perfect. Thank you Paul. Great job Paul. Appreciate it.(09:39)
Here as well is army veteran Greg Melikian. When Greg was 20 years old he served as a radio operator in the headquarters of Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower. I’d love to have heard some of those conversations. Much more interesting than today, right? 75 years ago, General Eisenhower directed Greg to broadcast around the world the long-awaited news that Germany had surrendered. Greg, your being here is very, very much appreciated. Thank you very much, it was a great honor meeting you before. Thank you very much. Very, very great honor.(10:17)
Our task today is to pass on to the next generation the blessings of liberty that you fought for and that you bled for, all for security. You wanted to secure our future, you wanted to praise and raise our flag and you did that. You raised our flag and you stand proud and you stand tall and we’re doing it in our nation too. Almost everyone. Every once in a while you see somebody not do it, we don’t like it when they don’t do it, do we? We don’t like it. I want to just thank you, fantastic job. American warriors did not defeat fascism and oppression overseas only to watch our freedoms be trampled by violent mobs here at home. We stopped those violent mobs very easily, all they had to do is say, “Please come in, Mr. President.” We’ll have it done in one hour. Please come in. It’s one of the great … To me just incredible that they don’t immediately, they just … As you know in Portland, the mayor last night, he was raided, his home was raided, he was thrown out of his home and then he’ll stand up and he’ll fight for these people. These people only know one thing and that is strength. That’s all they know. Strength, and we have strength.(11:30)
For the sake of all Americans, we must uphold the rule of law and defend the American dream for every child in our land. We must teach our children that America is the land of heroes like you, you’re heroes, you know that, right? Woody, you’re heroes, you’re great, great men. Great men, better believe it. We’re not ashamed in America, we’re not ashamed of anything. I signed a very important edict recently. Three months ago they were ripping down statues. I said, “You can rip them down but you’re going to serve 10 years in jail if you do,” and as soon as I did that, incredible, you haven’t heard about statues coming down, have you? Statues or monuments. But we’re not ashamed of our country. We’re proud of our country, prouder than we are of anything else. Our country is great and we’re going to keep it that way. We’re going to keep our country great.(12:24)
Together we will remember America’s towering victories. We will recognize America’s outstanding virtues and we will pay tribute to the heroes who keep us safe, strong, proud and free and I also in addition to our wonderful brilliant military, I want to thank law enforcement because the law enforcement, without them, we’re not here today very well. They’ve done an incredible job. Really an incredible job. Thank you again to the World War II veterans in attendance today. This is such a great tribute to North Carolina. We will never forget what you did for us, your legacy is etched forever into the heart and soul of a grateful nation and this spot is right now one of the most important military spots anywhere in the world. Congratulations to everybody and thank you for making it come true. Thank you all very much. God bless you, God bless North Carolina and God bless America. Thank you all very much. Thank you."
trump_Pirro_interview.txt,"(00:34)
Well I think a statement like that is criminal because we did a much better job than he could ever have done. As you know he was months later before he even thought the ban was a good thing and ultimately he had to apologize for what he did. We would have lost hundreds of thousands of lives and what I said to Woodward was actually good. I said calm, we need calm. We don’t need panic. You want me to jump up and down and start screaming, is everyone going to die, is everyone going to … That’s not what leadership is about. I’m a cheerleader for the country. We need calm. That’s all I’ve said, and by the way, that was done after, that was done after I had already banned China – (01:08)
From coming into the country. So I took big steps. (01:12)
So Jeanine, I took tremendous steps, everybody knew how I feel, otherwise I wouldn’t be banning China and then shortly thereafter I banned Europe. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives with each one of those bans and saved probably two or two and a half million lives by doing what we did early. (01:48)
Look, he is an opportunist and not a bad guy to be honest, he’s doing his thing. His first book I didn’t have anything to do with it and he wrote things that were false and untrue and I could have straightened it out and I said, “Let me do,” I took quite a few phone calls, 16 phone calls or something like that and we had some good conversations, not long, but good conversations. I don’t even know if the book is good or bad. I can tell you that what this says is that I said don’t panic, we don’t want panic. The press will make everything look bad because it’s fake, the fake news, most of it. I’d say 85% unfortunately, that’s the number we’re up to. But I discussed with him lots of different things. I think that they were very good discussions. We’ll see how it comes out but on this subject if you look, and he’s actually being [inaudible 00:02:37] because if he thought it was wrong, then he should have reported it early. If lives were going to be lost, he should have reported it early. The truth is he didn’t think there was anything wrong with it and I think that he thought it was surprising that the press even picked it up. It’s fake news. It’s all fake news. (03:05)
Well go out and look at the great leaders of the world. Winston Churchill stood on the rooftops in London, very calm, making speeches. Winston Churchill. You want calmness. You don’t want to somebody going to be jumping up and down. I could do that too. I could jump up and down, say, “Oh, this is terrible. This is terrible.” We want strength, we want leadership and we don’t want panic. (03:42)
They don’t want it because they think it’s going to make me look good and it wins the election for me but we’re very close to a vaccine. We also have already come out with therapeutics. If you look at remdesivir and others, the plasma, you take a look at the things that we’ve come out with already and the number, we’re 85% better in terms of fatalities. You look at the kind of numbers, I don’t know if you’ve been seeing this but we’re really rounding the corner and this is actually without anything further than we already have and we have some very good things out there already in terms of … I would say in terms of … You can’t use the word cure yet but pretty close to a cure. You’re going to be pretty close to a cure. The vaccine itself, I mean it could come out in October, but whether it’s October, November, December, it’s going to come out very soon. We have great companies that are very advanced and the results are going to be very good. (04:54)
Well it would be a disaster and we’re setting records on job production. We’re 10.4 million for the last four months. Nobody’s ever seen numbers like this, we’re setting records by millions and millions of jobs. The country’s coming back, it’s a super V, it’s beyond a V, it’s a super V, retail sales are beyond any number they were ever at. I mean think of it, we’re doing numbers now as we’re rounding I think the final turn, and that’s with, without, it doesn’t matter. With or without. Having the vaccine is great, it’s going to happen very soon. Could happen in October, it could very well happen October but we’re rounding the turn on the virus. They have to open up. It’s only the Democrats that are closed and in my opinion they’re closed for political reasons. They have North Carolina, you have Michigan, you have a couple of other states that are …(05:41)
New York, I mean, look at New York, what they’re doing in New York, that poor city with the restaurants. You can’t go to a restaurant. It’s like a ghost town. What they’ve done to New York and people are leaving is disgraceful between Cuomo and DeBlasio. That combination, I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. Coming from New York, it’s a very sad thing to witness, but we have to open up our states, totally open them. They’re keeping them closed because they want on November 3, they want to have the numbers as bad as possible. Based on the numbers that you’re seeing it’s not even affecting this but probably it would be better if these states were open. Forget about numbers though. The people that are inside those lockdowns, they’re suffering between depression, losing their jobs, drugs, alcohol, all of the different things that are happening to those people. That’s causing much more damage than the virus itself. (06:39)
Well look, I’d like people to go out and vote but if they want to sign something … You have solicited and unsolicited ballots – (06:47)
In the country. They’re going to send out 80 million unsolicited. In other words people that don’t even know what a ballot is, all of a sudden, here comes a ballot. Now we don’t even know if the people are going to get it. That’s my problem. Supposing they’re not sending them to Republican neighborhoods. Supposing they’re not sending them to wherever. Or supposing the people aren’t giving them back, or they go out and they harvest them. Somebody … It could be either way, but the Democrats seem to do that. I mean they played that game for a long time. (07:16)
Well, you might have to prosecute a lot more. The fact is they’re playing very dirty. 80 million ballots. We never had any number like that, anywhere close to that, and you’re going to see a mess on Election Night that’s going to be … It’s going to be legendary, and all they have to do is say, “Go out and vote,” or request a ballot. Get what’s called a solicited ballot or absentee, a lot of people use the word absentee. Get an absentee ballot where you request it, it comes to you, you vote and you send it back. That’s different, but they’re just sending out all over, they’re sending out 80 million ballots. (08:01)
How about signatures? They don’t even want to have signatures verified. (08:04)
They don’t want to have signatures verified. Where are they sending them? Who are they sending them to? Who’s sending them back? Who’s sending them back? It’s a very … It’s so unconstitutional, it’s so dishonest, and you have states that can’t even do small elections that way. (08:20)
Well we’re in courts, in many, many courts right now and hopefully the courts are going to decide because if they don’t you’re going to have one hell of a mess on Election Night. (09:04)
That’s right. Every problem. (09:17)
We’ll put them down very quickly if they do that. (09:19)
We have the right to do that, we have the power to do that if we want. Look, it’s called insurrection. We just send them in and we do it very easy. I mean it’s very easy. I’d rather not do that because there’s no reason for it but if we had to we’d do that and put it down within minutes, within minutes. Minneapolis, they were having problems. We sent in the National Guard within a half an hour. That was the end of the problem. It all went away. (09:40)
You look at Kenosha. Look at the problems they had. In fact the sheriffs there, the police chief, they’re all on my side, 100%. Law enforcement all over the country is on my side and I will say this. Look, we have … Even with the horrible things that are going on in New York and Chicago, all run by Democrats. Everything we’re talking about is run by Democrats. We’re not talking about one Republican place. It’s all run by Democrats. Even the police chiefs, they’re all quitting all over the country. Every single one, I think I saw 15 or 20, every single one of them is from a Democrat city. Look, before China sent us the plague, before the plague came in, we had the best crime numbers in history. When the plague came it changed things, let’s face it, it changed things, but all of the problems are in Democrat run cities. They’re badly run, the taxes are too much, they want to defund their police. Biden is all in that. He hasn’t still to this day used the term law and order. He’s afraid to use the term because he’s going to lose. He would lose the radical left supporters that he’s got if they even show up for him because there’s a question as to whether or not they’re going to show up, but they don’t want to talk about law and order.(10:51)
One other thing, you have a lot of people living in the suburbs, you know it well. You live in Westchester, you know it well. I ended a rule or regulation where low-income housing has been forced into the suburbs and this has been going on for a long time but especially so under Biden and Obama. I ended it, I terminated it. Not going to happen anymore unless I’m not here in which case they’re going to [inaudible 00:11:13] worse. So the suburbs are not going to have these projects forced into them. Now who in the suburbs is not going to vote for me? They’re going to make the projects bigger, better. They’re putting Cory Booker in charge. I mean one of the most liberal, the most liberal is Kamala, but Cory’s right there, and he’s going to be in charge of building projects in the suburbs. You’re going to destroy your suburbs. It’s already happening because you see what’s going on, you see what they’ve done. They take over the zoning and they force projects, projects. Really terrible situation. (11:53)
Well the suburbs are going to be next. (11:55)
Look, the suburbs, the people, these same protesters, but they’re not protesters, they’re anarchists, they’re agitators, and they’re rioters – (12:02)
They’re people that in many cases are paid – (12:05)
And then their stupid kids. (12:08)
By people that we’re looking at right now. We’re looking at them right now. (12:13)
No, not yet, but you’re going to be finding out pretty soon. Look, they’re stupid people too, because they’ll be overthrown as soon as they get their wish. These people don’t respect them, they’re just using their money. These are super liberal people that have money and they’re helping these anarchists and their agitators and they’re dangerous … Did you see what happened over the weekend with the people walking up to a restaurant and grabbing the steak off – (12:35)
The plate and biting the steak and then dropping it down, two elderly people having dinner at a restaurant and they walk in and they take a steak and they take the potato and they eat it? (12:54)
Well in Kenosha they asked me in, and we did a job like nobody’s ever seen before. (13:03)
Then you’re not allowed to do it, unless you do insurrection in which case it’s just not big enough for insurrection. (13:09)
You don’t need it. You don’t – (13:10)
Oh I’d be willing to do it in a heartbeat if you needed it but we don’t need it. Our National Guard – (13:14)
Our National Guard is so good and so tough. (13:18)
By the way, police departments, in places that we’re talking about, Seattle, we were going into Seattle and they solved the problem the night before we got there. (13:25)
We were getting ready to go, they heard we were going in. (13:32)
Ted Wheeler’s a disaster. He’s a laughingstock. He went out to protest with the so-called agitators and they were going to destroy him. They were going to beat him up badly, he fortunately had security but they were going to beat him up badly. The man is a disaster. If he would say come into Portland, within a half an hour, the whole thing would be solved. (13:53)
The governor’s gotten closer. Look, what’s going on out there? I will tell you – (13:56)
The governor has gotten closer. I’ve spoken to the governor two days ago. (13:59)
They’re arresting a lot of people that we sent in the U.S. Marshals for the killer, the man that killed the young man on the streets. He shot him. (14:08)
I mean it was on television. Just cold-blooded killed him. He didn’t like his hat or he didn’t like something and it wasn’t a Trump hat. (14:17)
It was a lot, it was a religious hat, and he shot him, cold blood. Two and a half days went by and I put out when are you going to go get him? The U.S. Marshals went in to get him and in a short period of time, they ended in a gunfight. This guy was a violent criminal. (14:35)
The U.S. Marshals killed him and I will tell you something, that’s the way it has to be. There has to be retribution when you have crime like this. There can’t be guys standing up that want to fight, they want to fight. You can’t throw bricks at people [inaudible 00:14:51]. (15:09)
So what’s going to happen, and this is a shame, you’re going to have a backlash like you’ve never seen if these people don’t stop. Because you have very smart, very tough people that aren’t going to take it any more and once they say we’re not going to take it anymore, its going to end in a very vicious backlash and that’s a terrible thing."

Thank you very much. Before I provide an update on our continued progress against the China virus, I’d like to discuss our latest actions against the Iranian regime.(00:36)
Today, I’m directing the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to notify the UN Security Council that the United States intends to restore virtually all of the previously suspended United Nations sanctions on Iran. It’s a snapback. Not uncommon. Two years ago, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, which was a product of the Obama Biden foreign policy failure, a failure like few people have seen in terms of the amount of money we paid for absolutely nothing and a short term deal. This deal funneled tens of billions of dollars to around 150 billion to be exact, plus 1.8 billion in cash, which I don’t know that the president had the authority to give. Gave 1.8 billion in cash. Just another great deal that turned out to be a total disaster that would have funded all of the chaos and the bloodshed and the terror in the region and all throughout the world.(01:48)
And I won’t say anything because I don’t like saying it, but Iran doesn’t have so much money to give to the world anymore, to the terrorist, to give to Al Qaeda, various other groups of people that they were funding. They have to keep their own regime together and it’s not easy for them. And if, and when I win the election within the first month, Iran will come to us and they are going to be asking for a deal so quickly because they are doing very poorly, but that deal was a disaster. $150 billion. $1.8 billion in cash and we got nothing except the short term little deal. Short term, expiring and starting to expire already. It’s terminated but it would have, if we didn’t terminate it, start to expire very shortly.(02:36)
A good deal was the deal we made with UAE and Israel and by the way, other countries, I will tell you now, want to come into that deal. Countries that you wouldn’t even believe want to come into that deal and all of a sudden, you’re going to have peace in the Middle East and you couldn’t have done it with this ridiculous Iran Nuclear Deal, as they call it, that President Obama made along with sleepy Joe Biden. I imposed the toughest ever sanctions on Iran and this has caused great difficulty for them, giving money to terrorist organizations and if they do, they’ll have hell to pay. Earlier this year, I ordered the strike that took out the world’s number one terrorist Qasem Soleimani. In addition to previously terminating leader and founder of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.(03:35)
The two leading terrorists by far in the world. The founder of ISIS, nobody even talks about that. And we also defeated, we now have 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Syria. When I took over, it was a mess. It was a total mess. It was, they were all over the place.(03:57)
My administration will not allow this Iran nuclear situation to go on. They will never have a nuclear weapon. Iran will never have, mark it down. Mark it down. Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. When the United States entered into the Iran deal, it was clear that the United States would always have the right to restore the UN sanctions that will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. We paid a fortune for a failed concept and a failed policy, a policy that would have made it impossible to have peace in the Middle East.(04:40)
Here at home, through Operation legend, we are confronting the wave of crime in Democrat run American cities, that’s absolutely shocking. When you look at Portland or New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, sometimes Los Angeles, Democrat run cities. They’re a mess because they don’t get it. Either they don’t get it or there’s something that nobody else understands.(05:14)
We’ve deployed more than 1,000 additional federal agents to help these Democrat run disasters. We just have done this. We have to give them a hand and we can stop it immediately. Like at Portland, would be so easy to stop. Would stop it immediately. We only sent in some Homeland people who are great, by the way, to save the courthouse, cause it would have been blown up or burned down and they did that very easily. But if we were called upon, we would send in, whether it’s Homeland, whether it’s FBI, whether it’s just law enforcement and we’d send them in quickly. We would eradicate it just like happened in Minneapolis. Soon as they were called in, they should have been called in a lot sooner. You would have had far less damage today.(06:06)
Today we announced that Operation legend has successfully resulted in nearly 1,500 arrests already. Bad ones. Bad ones. Really bad people. Prosecutions and prison sentences will follow and there’ll be very long time in prison for what they’ve done to these cities. Most cities are well run. Most of the nation as well run and the areas that we’re talking about are all, they’re all cases run by Democrats, usually radical left leaning Democrats like in New York or in Portland.(06:43)
We’ve made arrests in Kansas City, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Saint Louis, Memphis and Albuquerque for many violent crimes, including gun crimes, arson and 91 murders. We’re also using the full power of the federal government to defeat, as you know, the China virus.(07:07)
New cases have declined in 80% of the jurisdictions in the past week; 80%. New Zealand, by the way, had a big outbreak and other countries that were held up to try and make us look not as good as we should look because we have done an incredible job, but they’re having a lot of outbreaks, but they’ll be able to put them out and we put them out. The hospitalization rate has fallen in our country. 54% since its peak in April; 54%. Older Americans are still the most vulnerable to the virus. 92% of deaths have occurred among those 55 and older. Only 2.7% of deaths have occurred among those 44 years. Think of that. 44 years and younger. So 44 years old and younger only 2.7% of…(08:02)
… and younger. Only 2.7% of deaths have occurred. And many of those people had preexisting conditions, had problems, heart, diabetes, and other problems, but many of those. So think of that. Only 2.7% under 44 years of age. Excess mortality in Europe this year is 33% higher than the United States. Evidence that the tragic cost of this virus is higher in other Western nations. South Korea. You’ve been reading about South Korea doing well, well, they just had a very big breakout, but they’ll be able to solve the problem. We must all remain vigilant and continue to exercise extreme caution around those at highest risk as we know. Multiple colleges and universities announced that they would suspend in-person teaching. We have learned one thing, there’s nothing like campus. There’s nothing like being with the teacher as opposed to being on a computer board. It’s been proven, a lot better.(09:16)
It’s a lot better. The iPads are wonderful, but you’re not going to learn the same way you do by being there. So nevertheless, certain colleges and universities have announced that they would suspend the in-person teaching. For older people and individuals with underlying conditions, the China virus is very dangerous, but for university students, the likelihood of severe illness is less than or equal to the risk of a seasonal flu. And the seasonal flu happens and comes and it goes, and it can be very bad, but people don’t talk about it in the same way and they shouldn’t. But if you look at that, the odds are less than or equal to. Instead of saving lives, the decision to close universities could cost lives. It is significantly safer for students to live with other young people than to go home and spread the virus to older Americans. Makes sense.(10:20)
And the shut down thing is causing tremendous depression for those places that are still shut down. You look at certain areas that, in all cases, Democrat run, still shut down. And their numbers there aren’t even good. But causing tremendous depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol, abuse. A lot of problems are being caused. Probably far more, I would say Scott, than is caused by the virus itself now that we understand the virus. Colleges should take reasonable precautions. Students who feel sick should not attend class and should limit social interaction as they would for any other illness. And universities should implement measures to protect the high risk students or professors and teachers. The ultimate goal of testing is to prevent transmission in high risk settings and to prevent transmission, period. But especially in nursing homes and to care for the vulnerable and our elderly, which really fit into that definition of who is vulnerable.(11:44)
We have tremendous unused testing capacity in our country. We have a tremendous unused testing capacity. It’s something that a lot of other nations are very impressed with, they tell us. In our path forward, we will continue to follow a science based approach to protecting the high risk while enabling healthy Americans to safely go back to work in school. Our country will be open. Our country is getting opened quickly. Our stock markets are almost back to where they were prior to the China virus disaster coming in. And I want to thank you all for being here and we’ll take some questions. Yes, please. (12:40)
Well, I don’t know much about the movement other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate. But I don’t know much about the movement. I have heard that it is gaining in popularity. And from what I’ve hear is these are people that when they watch the streets of Portland, when they watch what happened in New York city in just the last six or seven months, but this was starting even four years ago when I came here. Almost four years, can you believe it? These are people that don’t like seeing what’s going on in places like Portland and places like Chicago and New York and other cities and states.(13:21)
And I’ve heard these are people that love our country and they just don’t like seeing it. So I don’t know really anything about it other than they do supposedly like me. And they also would like to see problems in these areas, especially the areas that we’re talking about, go away. Because there’s no reason the Democrats can’t run a city. And if they can’t, we will send in all of the federal, whether it’s troops or law enforcement, whatever, they’d like. We’ll send them in. We’ll straighten out their problem in 24 hours or less. (14:12)
Well, I haven’t heard that. But is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing? I mean, if I can help save the world from problems, I’m willing to do it. I’m willing to put myself out there. And we are actually. We’re saving the world from a radical left philosophy that will destroy this country. And when this country is gone, the rest of the world would follow. The rest of the world would follow. That’s the importance of this country. And when you look at some of the things that these people are saying with defund the police and no borders, open borders, everybody just pour right into our country, no testing, no nothing. You talk about testing, no testing. Mexico as you know has a very high rate of infection. The wall is now going to be, next week, 300 miles long.(15:09)
Our numbers are extraordinary on the border. And this is through luck, perhaps more than talent, although the talent is getting it built when one party refuses to allow it. And you don’t hear talk about the wall anymore. But I will say this, we need strength in our country not weakness. Too much weakness. Yes. John. (15:57)
Well, I hear great things about it, John. That’s all I can tell you. And it could be a political decision and-(16:02)
I can tell you and it could be a political decision because you have a lot of people over there that don’t want to rush things because they want to do it after November 3rd, and you’ve heard that one before, but I’ve heard fantastic things about Convalescent Plasma, and I’ve heard numbers way over 50 percent success and people are dying and we should have it approved if it’s good and I’m hearing its good. I heard from people at the FDA that it’s good, so we’ll see. I’m going to check that right after this conference. (16:39)
Well if the numbers are as good as I’m hearing. I’m hearing over 50 percent and that’s very good, and we’ve approved certain things that are 31 percent and that’s okay too. That’s not bad, and it’s really had a tremendous impact, but no I have… you’re telling me something right now that surprises me, but we’ll check it out right after this. (17:03)
I don’t want delays. I don’t want people dying. I don’t want people dying. Yeah, please go ahead. (17:15)
Yeah. (17:20)
Well I’m not happy with Goodyear because what they’re doing is playing politics and the funny thing is the people that work for Goodyear, I can guarantee you, I pole very well with all of those great workers in Goodyear, and when they say that you can’t have Blue Lives Matter, you can’t show a blue line, you can’t wear a MAGA hat, but you can have other things that are Marxist in nature, there’s something wrong with the top of Goodyear. And what the radical left does is they make it impossible for people to do business if they’re Republican or if they’re conservative, they put out all sorts of effort, don’t shop there. They do vicious things. Not so different than what you saw on the streets of Portland two nights ago. (18:10)
Oh, I don’t know that’s up to people, but I wouldn’t recommend it. If they want a whole political speech. If they want to let you not do what everybody’s doing. If they want to wear a MAGA hat, or if they want to wear a Blue Life, you know what Blue Lives Matter, right, that’s police men and women. That’s a terrible thing. That’s a terrible thing. They’re using their power over these people. And these people want to wear whatever it is that we’re talking about. You know that. And so I would be very much in favor of people don’t want to buy there, and you know what, they’ll be able to get a good job, because we set a jobs record over the last quarter as you know. The most jobs ever in the history of our country. You’ll be able to get another good job.(18:55)
I think it’s disgraceful that they did this. Please go ahead, in the back. (19:12)
Well I sent him best wishes. I hear he’s a wonderful gentleman, certainly a brave man and I send him best wishes. With that being said, because of that and obviously what happened in Hong Kong, we’ve taken all of the vast amounts of money that we use to subsidize Hong Kong, we essentially subsidize Hong Kong by giving them all sorts of incentives and that’s what made Hong Kong the exchange and business in Hong Kong successful. I’ve taken it all back. That means that the United States is going to do a lot more business.(19:48)
We really gave them tremendous incentive and subsidy in order that they be successful for freedom. But now that the freedom obviously seems to have been taken away, we will keep all of the incentives that we were giving them, which is billions, and billions of dollars, and all of that business will come into our country, including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, and it’ll all come here. But I feel badly for him, because I hear he’s a good person. I don’t know him, but I hear he’s a good person, obviously a very brave person.(20:24)
Did you have something, go ahead. (20:30)
Say it? (20:51)
Well this is a man that I get along with very well. We’re largely out of Iraq, we down to very few soldiers I said. We’re getting out of these endless wars, these ridiculous endless wars. We should have never been there in the first place. I think it was the worst decision made in the history of our country. Should have never been there, in the Middle East we should have never been, but we’re getting out rapidly over the course of three years. And getting out, it’s very sticky getting out and some people agree, and many people don’t agree, but I think most people very much agree.(21:22)
We’re doing very well in our negotiations with Afghanistan with getting out. We’re down to a much smaller number of people left there and I greet men and women coming home and coming home after they’ve been hit. I’ve also greeted many, many at Dover, greeted many bodies coming back in and we’ve been there 19 years and we’re basically policemen. We’re acting as police as opposed to soldiers and they’re going to have to police their own states and they’ve been doing that for thousands of years. But it’s time after 19 years that our soldiers come home. They’ve done an incredible job, but they’re not allowed to fight to win and maybe they shouldn’t be because a lot of the people, it’s not their fault. But with the Taliban and with going to Iraq again, we’re down in Afghanistan, very low numbers and that’ll be taking place and I let them know, do anything and you’ll be hit like you’ve never been hit before. We’re doing very well. Syria the same thing. Remember when I took all of the soldiers off of the border between Syria and Turkey, right? And everybody said, “Oh, that was two years ago. That was a long time ago.” They said, “Oh, this is terrible, terrible, terrible.” We’re going to leave. Why do we have our soldiers between Syria and Turkey? Turkey can definitely take care of itself. I have a very good relationship with President Erdogan and Syria’s been fighting forever. And I say, “Why are we guarding their border?” And I brought our soldiers back home. I got them out, and guess what? Nothing’s happened. They’ve been fighting like they have been for a thousand years okay? Nothing’s happened. And nobody mentions that. Everybody said, “This is going to be a disaster.” There’s no disaster, nothing’s happened.(23:18)
We’re getting out of the endless wars and we are building a military the likes of which the world has never seen. Two and a half trillion dollars we’ve spent. And we hopefully don’t ever have to use it. But we want to focus on a much bigger picture, because we have a much bigger picture. It’s when you look at what China’s doing, when you look at what Russia’s doing, when you look at what some other countries are doing. We want to be ready just in case there is a catastrophe. We don’t want to see that. We don’t want to ever use it. We’ve rebuilt our military. New missiles, new rockets, and new tanks, and new everything. Two and a half trillion… all made in the USA and we’ve upgraded in-(24:03)
Made in the USA and we’ve upgraded incredibly our nuclear capability and some of our nuclear needed nourishment, it needed new strength, and we’ve upgraded it very, very significantly. I mean to a level that nobody would even believe and hopefully we don’t, you pray to God, we never have to use it, okay? But we’ve never been in a position where we’ve been this strong, please. (24:36)
Yes. Having to do with UAE and Israel. (24:44)
I do. (24:57)
I think, look, they’ve definitely got the money to pay for it. It’s nice because usually what we, a lot of times we make deals they don’t have 25 cents, these countries we deal with. We give it to them like, “How about paying us back later?” But they never pay because they don’t have the money. Now they have the money and they would like to order quite a few F35s. It’s the greatest fighter jet in the world, as you know, by stealth, totally stealth. You can’t see. It makes it very difficult. I was asking a pilot, “What do you think is better? This one, this one, that one,” talking about Russian planes, Chinese planes.(25:31)
He said, “Well, the advantage we have is you can’t see it, so when we’re fighting, they can’t see us.” I say, “That sounds like a really big advantage to me,” to these guys.(25:43)
You know, they look, by the way, I said to these pilots that I meet, they look better than Tom Cruise, and they’re definitely tougher. He’s a nice guy, but these people are amazing and I speak to him a lot about it. What do you think, as I go around to the various places, I saved the big one in Florida as an example. That was a big one, knocked down pretty much by the hurricane. So, I spent a lot of time on that. And it’s the greatest plane in the world.(26:15)
One thing about that kind of thing, technology, high technology, greatest plane doesn’t last long if somebody comes up with something else, but we’re always the one to come up with something else. So yeah, they’d like to buy F35s, we’ll see what happens. It’s under review, but they made a great advance in peace in the Middle East, even the New York Times thought it was an incredible deal. Can you imagine that. Tom Friedman had a very nice thing to say about it. I spoke to him about it. He thought it was terrific and it is terrific.(26:46)
I see a lot of countries coming in fairly quickly and when you have them all in, ultimately Iran will come in too, there’ll be peace in the Middle East. That’ll be a nice. Iran will be very much neutralized. They never thought this could have happened. With the horrendously stupid Iran deal signed by Obama, this could have never happened.7:15)
On the Goodyear issue, you ride on Goodyear tires in the presidential limousine.(27:19)
Yep. You’re right.7:20)
If there were an alternative, would you want those tires swapped out?(27:23)
Yeah, I would do that. I would swap them out based on what I heard. We’ll see what happens. Look, you’re going to have a lot of people not wanting to buy that product anymore and they’ll buy from a competitor made in the USA too, okay? Please. (27:55)
When I listened to that, and then I see the horror that he’s left us, the stupidity of the transactions that he made, look what we’re doing. We have our great border wall, we have security, we have the UAE deal, which has been universally praised. Praised by people that aren’t exactly fans of Donald Trump for various reasons. I don’t know why, can’t be my personality, but they’re not fans. When I look at what we have. Now, look at how bad he was, how ineffective a president he was. He was so ineffective, so terrible, slowest growing recovery in the history, I guess since 1929, on the economy. Don’t forget until the China virus came in, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. I’m going to have to do it a second time, we’re doing it again. Hard to believe we’re doing very well. You heard the numbers they’re way, way down on the virus. But when you look at the kind of numbers that we’re producing on the stock markets, we’re almost at the level, in fact, NASDAQ and S&P are higher than they were at the highest point prior to the China virus coming and the plague coming in.(29:14)
Now, president Obama did not do a good job and the reason I’m here is because of President Obama and Joe Biden, because if they did a good job, I wouldn’t be here and probably if they did a good job, I wouldn’t have even run. I would have been very happy. I enjoyed my previous life very much, but they did such a bad job that I stand before you as president. Thank you all very much."
trump_protecting_seniors.txt,"(00:30)
Thank you. What a nice group. Thank you very much. Beautiful, thank you. (00:52)
Thank you very much, please. We are going to be talking to our great senior citizens, that’s what I’m here for today. (00:56)
We love our senior citizens. And I’m honored to be here in Fort Myers to reaffirm my solemn pledge to America’s seniors, it’s so important to me, I happen to be a senior. I will protect you, I will defend you, and I will fight for you with every ounce of energy and conviction that I have. You devoted your life to this country and I am devoting my life to you. My administration is working every day to give our amazing senior citizens the care, support, and respect that you deserve, and you understand that, we’ve worked together for a long time. As president, I’m deeply aware that America’s 54 million seniors have borne the heaviest burden of the China virus. Many older Americans have endured months of isolation, missing weddings, births, graduations, church, and family reunions, you know that very well, you know it all too well. My heart breaks for every grieving family that has lost a precious loved one, I feel their anguish, and I mourn their loss, I feel their pain.(02:09)
I know that the terrible pain that they have gone through, and you lose someone, and there’s nothing to describe what you have to bear, there’s nothing to describe it. In times of challenge, we turn to our fellow Americans for a shoulder to lean on and we turn to God for healing and strength, and together we will overcome. My message to America’s seniors today is one of optimism, confidence, and hope. Your sacrifice has not been in vain. The light at the end of the tunnel is near. We are rounding the turn, I say that all the time, some of the media doesn’t like hearing it, but I say it all the time, we’re rounding that turn. Don’t listen to the cynics, and angry partisans, and professional pessimists, we are Americans and we will prevail, we are prevailing, and we are… It’s amazing what’s happening, if you look at what’s going on, it’s been really very amazing.(03:15)
I’m moving heaven and earth to safeguard our seniors from the China virus to deliver life-saving therapies in record time and to distribute a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year, and we’re really doing it even sooner than that, you see what’s going on, we have the vaccines getting ready to go. Seniors will be the first in line for the vaccine and we will soon be ending this pandemic, hasn’t happened a thing like this since 1918, 1917, that was a bad one too, that was a real bad one. I will not rest until we’ve eradicated this plague from our country, and our lives, and our world, we want it out. When the China virus arrived, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II. Our aggressive and early action saved more than 2 million lives compared to the best estimates from last spring, you remember when they were giving you estimates.(04:14)
Since the beginning, our nation’s seniors have been my top priority, it was obvious very early on that it was affecting the seniors not young people. Young people are… They have that strong immune system and I give all credit to them, but they have a strong immune system, and 99.99, think of that. But, when you get into people that have a few more years, it’s a little bit more difficult, when you get a lot more years, it’s a lot more difficult. But, what they’ve done with therapeutics now and what they’ve done with all of the other things that they’re doing, it’s incredible. We heightened mitigation and surge testing to protect those at highest risk. We sent billions and billions of dollars in funding to personal protective equipment and distributed rapid testing to 15,400 nursing homes all over the country.(05:09)
We’ve worked with a lot of governors and some have done a great job, and some have done not a great job, and some have done a very poor job, actually, but some have done a great job, but we’re working very closely with the governors of the states. Just this week, even the New York Times, this was shocking, was forced to admit that ‘experts are saying with genuine confidence that the pandemic in the United States will be over far sooner than they expected’. And they’re right, but I was shocked to hear coming out of the New York Times, right? I was a little [inaudible 00:05:55], and it’s thanks to my administration’s Operation Warp Speed, incredible people. Because of advances in treatment we pioneered, and we have many treatments, but because of these great advances, we’ve reached the point where the fatality rate is reduced by 85% since April and now it’s up to probably 91%. Well, I’m here, I tell you. (06:27)
Thank you. Well, I don’t know what they gave me, but give me some more of it right now and you can have some too. No, I know exactly what that gave, it was actually pretty amazing. I’m also working with the FDA and HHS to make the antibody treatment that I received, it’s called Regeneron plus… Also, it’s incredible, and what they can do today is incredible. And they felt very confident even six months ago when they started, think of it, we got this all done in a very short period of time and now we’re going for emergency use, because we’re going to make it available to everyone who needs it for free, anybody in the country. And Eli Lilly is making a very similar drug, and Alex, they’re working very hard on that, right? Alex Azar, so thank you very much, because I want people to get it and we’re getting it free, right? So, we got to do that. If you need it, if you don’t need it, that’s even better, okay? That’s even better, but if you need it, right? You get it.(07:54)
It’s really pretty amazing what happened, because I wasn’t feeling great and the next day I wake up and I’m saying, “Who can I fight today?” Thank you. So, our groundbreaking therapies have significantly improved and improved our outcomes for elderly patients, but I’ll not relent until all American seniors are safe, you’re going to be safe, a hundred percent safe, and we’re at a point where really so much progress has been made. Under Operation Warp Speed, we’re on track to deliver at least 100 million doses of a vaccine this year, and could even be a little bit sooner than what they were originally anticipating, with hundreds of millions more to quickly follow, Alex, remember that Alex. Today, I’m thrilled to announce that we have just finalized a partnership with CVS and Walgreens, two places you know pretty well, I guess, to immediately deliver the vaccine directly to nursing homes at no cost to our seniors, right? No cost.(09:15)
These are very effective, once you have that vaccine you can open those doors and say, “Here I am.” But with everything that I say and everything I do, if you feel safer at home… And we can all be like, ” Let’s get out there.” And I felt as president, I knew there was risk, but I had to be out, I can’t just be locked in a basement, to put it… Lock them in a basement. I felt I had to be out there, I would see Gold Star families, [inaudible 00:00:09:44], and I’ve been looking forward for months to come into the White House, and many, many other people, military people and heads of state. And I know you put yourself at risk, but you can’t… You have to lead your life. But I say this, there are people also that would rather stay in place, stay where you are, and to those people, and I understand that very well, stay, just relax, stay until it’s gone, and it’ll be gone, but stay. Don’t feel badly or don’t feel good about it, just stay, if you feel safe, stay.(10:15)
I’m working as hard as I can so you can kiss and hug your children and grandchildren very soon, that’s something I missed also, I will be honest with you. As we shelter high-risk Americans with extreme vigilance, we must also allow lower-risk Americans to return to work and return to school. I mean, children should go to school. My young son, Baron, had it, and he had it, and all of a sudden he doesn’t have it, it’s like… It was different, it’s a whole different deal, and they should go to school, and they have to, because… I talk about the cure, right? It cannot be worse than the problem itself, it’s a very simple statement, but the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. And with young children, they have to go to school, they have to be with other kids, they have to grow up, they can’t lose a year of their life. And if you look at some of these lockdowns that the Democrats are doing in some states, if you look at North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, and Michigan, we won the case against her in Michigan.(11:24)
I mean, she’s running like a prison except for her husband who’s allowed to go boating, that doesn’t work out somehow. Fortunately, they caught him, he was going to go on the lake boating, that’s nice, but nobody else was allowed to do it. But we won the case against her for Michigan, and we freed up the state, and it’s a great thing, I mean, it’s a great thing, we freed up the state. Because that whole thing with drugs, and alcohol, and depression and all of the horrible things, we could go over a long list of things, but we can’t let that happen. So, we want the Democrat, radical left, in many cases, Democrats, we wanted to open their states, open up your states, and we’re very careful with our seniors, and that’s different, but open up your states, get it back.(12:16)
Despite punishing society-wide lockdowns in Europe, I don’t know if you’ve been watching, they’re now experiencing a massive surge in cases. Daily cases are 2500% higher in the United Kingdom, as an example, and 722% higher in Europe than in the United States, okay? No, think of that. And we wish them… And we’re working with them closely, we’re making ventilators for them. For many of the countries over there, we became the ventilator king. I mean, we didn’t have many ventilators, we had… Really, we inherited bare cupboards, I said the cupboards were bare, in many of the states they had… Cupboards were bare, and now they’re loaded up and they’re ready…(13:03)
Cupboards were bare. And now they’re loaded up and they’re ready. But the hardest thing are the ventilators because of the complexity of the machine, and the cost, the size, but the pure complexity. And we make thousands of ventilators now a month and we’re sending them all over the world. We’re all set with the ventilators but we’re sending them all over the world. But hopefully you won’t need them. Soon you won’t even need them. I really think you’re going to not need the ventilators, hopefully soon, very soon. But sadly in Europe, the average daily deaths are really soaring. 402% higher in the United Kingdom. 493% higher in Europe. Meanwhile, in the United States deaths have decreased by 37%. So that’s something, right.(13:53)
The fake news doesn’t want to tell you that, right? They want no piece of that. They don’t want anything to do with that. So whether you’re Republican or Democrat, we must use facts over fear. We have to. Science over hysteria, hope over despair, and the common good over partisan politics. And again, if you feel good, if you feel safe because it’s going to be gone, stay where you are. Don’t leave. Don’t say, “Oh gee, I have to get out.” The President said, “Let’s get out.” Stay where you are. I have a lot of friends, they’re strong people. They’re senior citizens. Great people, very successful people. Hi. Look, she’s waving. Hi. Thank you. Thank you, hun.(14:32)
But you know they’re tough actually, but they feel comfortable until this has gone and there are people, and I do that. Do that. I might do that. If I weren’t in this position, maybe I’d be doing it myself. In this position, it’s a little tougher. But we cannot allow unscientific, panic driven, fear-based policies to deny our children and grandchildren their future, and their dreams. We can’t take a year or two years out of their lives. There’s a whole social thing going on there too.(15:02)
These left wing lock downs will crush America, and my plan is very simple. We’re going to crush the virus and go back to exactly where we were. We’re almost getting back there now. So together, we will end this pandemic. We will rebuild our economy and we will ensure our seniors can live long, happy, secure, and healthy lives with your grandchildren and your children. You’re going to hug them, right? It’s good. Under my leadership next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country economically. We’re grateful to be joined today by Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar. Alex, we’re counting on you. We’re counting… I’m going to blame him if this stuff doesn’t happen fast, right?(15:48)
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services, a fantastic woman, Administrator Seema Verma. Thank you, Seema. Great job you’re doing. A friend of mine who’s become very, very popular, I guess that was what that big applause was. I was backstage, I said, “Who just came in?” I thought Elvis entered the room. It was your Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis. Stand up. That’s great, Ron. Great.(16:34)
And by the way, we have some crowd. You see what’s going on outside? The mayor said, “He’s never seen anything like that. He’s never seen anything.” Now there’s a lot of love outside. I want to tell you. That’s a lot of love and we’re leading in the State of Florida, just so we understand. By perhaps a lot. Also with some warriors, Representatives Gus Bilirakis. Gus, Gus, great job, Gus. And another friend of mine, these are really terrific people, Greg Stube. Greg, thank you very much, Greg. Thank you. Thanks as well to Fort Myers, Mayor Randy Henderson. Randy. Thank you. Thank you, Randy. Good job, Randy. That’s quite a crowd, huh?7)
Welcome to town, Mr. President.(17:29)
That’s good. Thank you very much. And Cape Coral Mayor Joe Coviello. Joe Coviello. Thank you, Joe. Great job. Great job. We’re also tremendously honored to be joined by World War II and Korean War veteran, a very brave guy, Wally Cortese. Wiley Cortese. Thank you, Wally. You look good, Wally. I’ll tell you, two wars and you’re looking good. Thank you, Wally. Appreciate it. Beautiful. Thank you very much. Thanks also to all of the members of the VFW Golden Gate Honor Guard, they’re with us today. Thank you. That’s so great. That’s so great. VFW. Fantastic job. Thank you very much for being here. As I fight to protect our amazing seniors from the China virus, I’m also fighting to protect you from another danger. One, which threatens everything we cherish, value and worked our entire lives to build and to defend. As we gathered today, seniors are under threat from a radical left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life. We’re not going to allow it. And you know one thing, sleepy Joe and do nothing about it. The left has been taken over by socialists and Marxists and extremists and they have. They want to transform our nation into a country that would no longer be recognizable. And their agenda will shatter America’s seniors, their plan to delay the vaccine, delay therapies and prolong the pandemic will cost thousands and thousands of lives, will be horrifying for our country.(19:33)
They are planned for higher taxes. They want to quadruple taxes. Every company will move out. They’ll go back to where they came. We had tremendous people, tremendous companies come into our country. We’re bring in tremendous jobs, 160 million jobs, we’ve never had anything like it, before the plague and then we’re building it back up again. Last four months, we’ve set records on employment, on hiring employment. And a number that, let’s say a year ago, wouldn’t have sounded great, but now sounds incredible, 7.8% unemployment. Think of it. People were talking about 42%. We’re back down to 7.8 and we’ll be soon down to the number where we were, seven months ago. Pretty amazing.(20:20)
I never thought I’d be happy with 7.8%, but you know when you think about it, right, they were talking 39%, 42%. Ron, 7.8 is a pretty amazing thing. We did that in a rapid fashion. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it, actually. They’re planned for higher taxes and crippling regulations, however, would crater our economy. Their insane energy policies because you know they’re going to be fracking. Hey, Biden for a year and a half is saying there will be no fracking. Then he looks out, he gets the nomination because Elizabeth Warren refused to get out. So Bernie, a second time, that happened twice to Bernie. Bernie, he’s a hell of a loser. That’s one thing I’ll say. He knows how to lose. He knows how to lose. He loses he goes back to work like nothing happened. No, they took it away from him twice. I think the second time in a way worse, because she stayed in, she took the votes and sleepy Joe just got in there. That’s why you got to be careful. You got to be careful. You never know what happens.(21:23)
But if you take a look and we can’t let any of this stuff happen. And you look at what’s happened to other countries, where they’ve had this philosophy, where they’ve had this ideology. We can’t let… But you watch what they’re saying about the fracking, where he said no, and he said it with such… It’s not like, “Well, I’ll think about it.” He’s doing the same thing with the courts right now. They’re going to pack the Supreme Court. You see what they want to do. Would be destruction of our country. But you take a look. So he says, “No, there will be no fracking.” These are the words. “There will be no fracking. You don’t understand what I just said. There will be no fracking.” And then he gets very agitated. “There would be no fracking.”(22:06)
And he gets a nomination, goes to Pennsylvania, they inform him that they have a million jobs and fracking’s a big deal. And they like inexpensive energy, right? And so, he goes from, “There will be no fracking with great anger”, to “I never said they wouldn’t be fracking.” It’s the craziest thing. If that ever happened to me and the media doesn’t even talk about it. That’s just one of many things. Then he does that thing with the courts. You see that, right? He goes, “I’ll tell you after the election what I’m going to do.” How important is it? Because he’s going to put on radical, left, crazy judges that will destroy your lives. It’s the most important. They’ve always said… I’ve always heard, Ron, I’ve always heard this, that the most important thing a president does is pick Supreme Court Justices, right? I would say maybe the military, but let’s say it’s right there. And he has to create a list of more than just that, he has to create a list and let you know and he has to pick from that list. That’s what I did. I created a list of 25 people, highly, highly capable people. And a lot of people said, that’s why I won the election, actually. So I don’t know if that’s true or not. But it was a very important part, Mary, you understand mayors, you know that.(23:29)
So their insane energy policies will abolish millions of jobs and cost seniors thousands of dollars per year in higher energy bills. Their anti-police agenda will empower violent mobs and put every community at risk. Their anti-suburban agenda threatens the property values of millions of American seniors and your families, who own homes in residential neighborhoods, in the suburbs. I’m saving the suburbs. People saying, “Well, women in the suburbs, do they like Trump?” I said, “Yeah, they liked me. You know why they like, because I’m saving their homes.” That’s why they like me. They may not like me, but they like what I’m doing, and that’s more important.(24:17)
Oh boy, they have these crazy people. The people on television, I don’t know if suburban women, suburban women want security. They want safety. They want law and order. They want their homes to be protected. The socialist ideology that they will use and indoctrinate our youth with is like poisonous Anti-American propaganda.(24:46)
The plan by Washington Democrats to give amnesty and free healthcare to illegal border crossers will obliterate Medicare, bankrupt your social security, robbing you of the benefits that you’ve paid for your entire lives. Look, take a look at Venezuela. People don’t realize, that was a wealthy country 18, 17 years ago. It was so wealthy. And it’s gone from being wealthy, they don’t have medicine, they don’t have food, they don’t have water. They don’t have anything. And it can happen here, just a much larger version with that ideology. And that’s the ideology that they’re looking at. It’s crazy.(25:23)
These radicals will destroy Medicare with totally open borders. And by the way, you know the wall, it’s up to almost 400 miles. 400. 400 miles. And it goes down deep, tunneling. It goes down deep and up very high. Now it’s had a tremendous… We’ve never had a stronger Southern border than we have right now. It’ll be finished very soon. We’re doing 10 miles a week. That’s a lot. 10 miles a week. Army Corps of Engineers are also doing Lake Okeechobee and lots of other things, right? They’re doing a good job, right? They’re giving away your benefits, that’s what-(26:03)
They’re giving away your benefits, that’s what they want to do to anyone in the world who trespasses into our country. And we all have big hearts and we want to take care of people. But when you say, “We’re going to give you free healthcare. We’re going to give you college education.” I sarcastically said once, “We’re going to give you a beautiful brand new Rolls-Royce. Okay? If you’re an illegal immigrant. And CNN went and they said, “The President lied to the seniors.” They just don’t get it. They get it. Actually, unfortunately they get it more than you would think. They’re a little bit on the evil side.(26:39)
But, you’re going to bring millions of people … You’re going to bring millions and millions of people. It’s like, when you say, “Free healthcare, and free education, and free this and that,” millions of people are going to pour into the country. It’s not going to be stoppable. And we can’t let that happen. They care more about illegal aliens than they care about senior citizens, the Democrats. The left is coming after me because I’m defending you. And that’s true. That’s why they come after me. Every day they come … But we caught them on the Russian hoax. We finally caught them after two and a half years. Russia knows. Turned out to be the exact opposite. They’re the ones that were playing with Russia. That was a beauty. Hillary … Crooked Hillary. Now they’re the ones. Yeah, I agree with you. I used to just be quiet. And I agree with you 100%. Millions and millions of dollars they paid. And they tried to show it. It was the greatest hoax and the greatest political crime in the history of our country. That’s what they committed. But I’m the only one standing between their open borders and extremism and the healthcare benefits that you’ve earned and paid for. All your life, you paid for. As long as I’m President, no one will lay a hand on your Medicare or your social security. As a candidate, I made a sacred promise that I’d strengthen, protect and defend your Medicare benefits. And that’s exactly what I’ve done. I’ve done that, right?(28:24)
My administration’s fought to deliver greater security, affordability, fairness, economic stability to our nation’s seniors. Under eight years of the previous administration, premiums for Medicare health plans went up including a 25% increase right here in Florida. That’s for the previous people. Under my administration, we’ve lowered Medicare Advantage premiums by a number nobody even believes, 34% nationwide. And today, it’s the lowest level in 14 years. Did you know that, Ron? That’s not a bad thing for you to put into your speech, right? Who would think that? No, but seriously, we’ve brought it way down. This group over here, they’ve done a great job. Thanks to our efforts, there are 2,000 … Thank you.(29:16)
There are 2,000 more Medicare Advantage plans today than there were three years ago. That’s incredible. Think of that. That means more choice and more competition for better care at a much lower cost. When we rapidly expanded telehealth for Medicare beneficiaries during the pandemic, the number of tele-health users increased from 14,000 a week to 1.7 million a week. What’s that percentage? Yet, all of this danger, it’s all in danger because if these other people get in, they will end all of that. The telehealth … It’s interesting. We’ve learned something for children, they’re much better in a classroom than they are on a laptop. Okay? Children.(30:03)
But for your health and what you can do, you can do so much of it, such a big percentage, better than going out and going through … This telehealth has been amazing. It’s been really incredible. It’s been an incredible thing. It’s increased like six, 7,000, I think 6500%. And it’s probably the only thing that came out of this whole deal that we really can take pleasure at, telehealth. It’s been really an incredible thing that’s happened. Over 130 Democrats in Congress, including far left Senator Kamala Harris, who is the most … I said, “He’ll never choose her because nobody treated him worse than her. Nobody.” Plus, her poll numbers were sinking. She never even got to Iowa. She never got there. And when I said, “Oh … ”(31:01)
And by the way, didn’t Mike Pence do a good job the other night? Right? Good man. Did a great job. And I had a great … Thank you. Really, I had a lot of fun last night with that. That was a nice evening. It was a nice pleasurable evening. I had somebody going totally crazy last night. “But, I told you … I told you that.” She told me? She’s going to … Oh, okay. I believe you, right? No, but I understand that worked out very well last night. That’s what the word is, so that’s good. Another evening in paradise, I call it. They’re sponsoring a socialist healthcare plan that would annihilate your Medicare. The Democrats’ policy proposals may go by different names. They put all sorts of names. They say single payer, or so-called the public option.(32:03)
But really, they’re all based on the same core promise, raiding Medicare to fund a socialist healthcare takeover. And it’s going to destroy your Medicare. That’s the one thing you know for sure. Every one of their plans involves rationing care, restricting access, denying coverage, slashing quality, extending wait times and massively raising your taxes. Other than that, it’s actually quite good. As we know from seeing these left wing policies in action around the world, seniors will be the victims. And that’s what happens, the first to go are the seniors, the victims are really the seniors. This is nothing that unique. Socialist healthcare plans always end up denying care and coverage to the sick and the elderly in order to control costs.(32:54)
And they always feel that this is the easiest way to do it. We must not let them bring this lethal and deadly agenda to America. Don’t let it happen. Got to vote them out. Get out and vote. Democrat healthcare proposals would abolish private insurance for 180 million Americans. Just so you know, there are many people, they’ve had a good life, they’ve done well. They have private plans. They are unbelievable. They love their plan. Those plans are gone. Those plans are gone. They’d abolish the Medicare Advantage program that benefits 24 million seniors, including one out of two Hispanic seniors and one out of three African-American seniors who enrolled in the Medicare Advantage. Right?(33:46)
And that will all be ended. It would be abolished, for big fat, ugly socialized medicine. You go to a hospital, you don’t feel good. Go to a hospital room and wait for three days to see a doctor. I will never allow that to happen. Under my administration, your Medicare Advantage is safe. Your benefits are protected. And I will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always, always, always. They always play that card, right? Remember they used to say, “Oh, he’s going to give up.” At first they said I was going to be in a war within the first week. Whatever happened to that, right? Just the opposite. Our great warriors are coming home. They’re all coming home. They’re all coming home. You’re welcome.(34:38)
Look at North Korea, they thought would be a war and a war immediately with North Korea. How’s that worked out, right? It’s worked out very nicely. Talk, we’ll talk, keep talking. But it worked out very well. But the other thing they said, “He will destroy your social security.” Really? Did I? I said, “No.” No, they’re going to destroy it, because they’ll destroy our country. They’ll destroy your social security and they’ll destroy your country. And Joe won’t have any idea what happened, because he’s gone. Let’s face it. He’s gone. Another critical issue for senior citizens is the price of prescription drugs. This is something I’m very proud of, because we’ve lowered Part D prescription drug premiums by 12%, saving senior citizens $1.9 billion.(35:23)
But the biggest yet to come, I stood up to big pharma, and that’s not easy. They got big money. They’re the biggest lobbyist in this country by far. And I signed an executive order, implemented a most favorite nations policy for the United States. For years you’ve heard, “We pay more for drugs than any other country.” Well, that’s not even close. We pay much more. And in other countries that we know very well take advantage of us and they pay a fraction. I mean, you wouldn’t even believe how much less, but a fraction. 25 cents for a pill, as opposed to $2 for a pill. Same pill from the same lab plant, right? And I instituted a favorite nations clause. I said, if Germany or some other country is getting our stuff low, I want a favored nations. Meaning, I want it for the same price. And they have gone crazy.(36:18)
I have never seen so many ads. They put on more ads against me now than sleepy Joe Biden, I’m telling you, and they understand. Look, it should have been done a long time ago. This should’ve been done years ago. Plus, I got rid of the middleman and I gave Ron DeSantis the right to go to Canada in the meantime, because I think eventually you’ll be using this. But in the meantime, you’ll also be getting the rebates. Okay? Rebates, you know who they go to? The middlemen. You know how rich the middlemen are? I’m rich. These guys blow everyone away. I don’t know … Nobody even knows who the hell they are. Did you ever hear … Does anybody know a middleman? I would like to meet. It’s Biden’s son. It’s Hunter. Oh, it’s Hunter. I’ll bet you Hunter is a middleman. He’s collecting …(37:14)
He’s like a vacuum cleaner, he follows his father around collecting. What a disgrace. It’s a crime family. You want to know something? It’s a crime family. He’s following his father. Hunter Biden is a middleman. Oh, that’s wild. No, these people are amazing. These middlemen, you’re right. Hunter made no money until his father became Vice President and now he’s like a vacuum cleaner. His father goes to Germany, Hunter’s right there. “Hey, give me a couple of million.” Not a couple of million. Hell of a lot more than a couple of million. That’s a shame. I’ll tell you what, it’s an organized crime family, as far as I’m concerned. I capped out of pocket costs … And the way they get protected by big tech and by the media, the media doesn’t want to ask … This is the hottest subject there is right now.(38:04)
And I didn’t watch sleepy Joe last night. I just wanted to see what he looked like. He wasn’t looking too good. I just couldn’t watch, it was too painful. But, they didn’t … I understand that they did not ask him a question about this. Can you believe it? Now, think of it. And Stephanopoulos interviewed me two weeks ago and he was nasty. He was nasty. I mean, he was tough. He’s a tough guy.(38:29)
I watched last night, the little stuff I watched and what I heard, it was like softballs, every … But he didn’t … This is the hottest subject there is. They didn’t ask them one question about their corruption in the family. They didn’t ask him one question about how big tech is protecting him. Big tech is not allowing anybody to … How about this? They took down, I guess, Kayleigh, but they took … How about Kayleigh? Isn’t she great? No, but they took down her Twitter site because she had the audacity to put up-(39:03)
… on her Twitter site because she had the audacity to put up an article written in the New York Post, which is one of the biggest newspapers in the country. I think it’s the oldest newspaper in the country. They put up a article, and they took down her site. Can you believe what’s going on in this country? And then they talk about freedom of the press. They also said last night, it was very interesting, they talked about the transition, the friendly transition. Will you agree to the friendly … Of course the answer is yes. First of all, I don’t think there’s going to be a transition because we’re going to win but … Let’s hope we don’t have to worry about it. No, but think of this. They get up, “We demand a friendly transition.” Yet, we caught them spying on my campaign, and trying to take down the president of the United States. Right? That wasn’t too friendly. Right? That wasn’t too friendly, and we caught them cold.(39:55)
Anyway, let’s get back to the medical parts of the world. This is much simpler to understand, if you think about it. But I capped out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 a month. People were going, literally they were going bankrupt over insulin, or they weren’t getting the insulin, which is a terrible thing. It’s $35 a month or less for seniors in many Medicare drug plans, saving them an average of nearly $450. I mean that’s a tremendous saving. Many cases much less than 35. Seema, in many cases much less than the 35. Right? Did you say $1 in some cases? What’s your lowest number? Come on, Seema. Let’s hear it. Huh? She doesn’t want to give too much. I think maybe $1 is too much. Okay. She’s very straight. She’s a straight player. You brought it down from what number? The 35 down from what Seema? (40:56)
Tremendously. Yeah. It’s a great job. You did that. But she would come up to me for a year and a half talking about the insulin. The insulin is the biggest, it’s such a problem for people where they’d go without it. They had no choice because it was too expensive. Great job both of you. Thank you very much.(41:16)
I also announced that more than 35 million Medicare beneficiaries will soon receive a card in the mail with $200 that you can use to help pay for prescription drugs. But I was going to tell you, I’ve allowed Ron DeSantis now to go to Canada and buy your prescription drugs. Now, why am I doing that? Because before all of the favored nations and everythings kick in, which ultimately I think that’s what you’re going to be using more than anything. But Canada gets their drugs for about 50% of what we get them for. Same drug, same exact pill, company, everything, Johnson & Johnson, whatever the company, Ron is going to buy from Canada, and he’s just cut your price in half. Right? Right? When are you starting that Ron? When do you think you’ll start? (42:10)
When? (42:11)
Very soon. So Alex get him approved up. Okay? Whatever you have to do. I think it’s great. Some people say, “Well that doesn’t …” My attitude is, whatever the hell it takes. We have this terrible system that’s taken years and years to rig. Like the ballots. Right? Like the ballots. It’s taken them years and years to rig. So they’re very simple. Go buy from Canada. We get rid of the middleman. We get rid of all of this nonsense. You like that mayor? You like that mayor? Both of you? Pretty great Ron. Do it fast Ron. Do it fast. To care for, I mean you’re not going to believe what’s going to be happening with your numbers. I mean they’re coming down big.(42:49)
We’re not talking about 1%. I mean I don’t even want to mention it, but last year out of 51 years, this is the first time the prescription drug prices have come down in 51 years. They didn’t come down much. They came down like 1%, which I don’t want to mention in one way. But in another way, it tells you something. First time in 51 years when drug prices come down. But now you’re talking about a 50, 60, 70, and 80% reduction in your prescription drug prices. We got to get it all finished up. Wouldn’t it be terrible if Sleepy Joe took this over, the system that I’ve created? And you people will say, “Man, has he been a great president. Look at what he’s done.”(43:32)
As an example, transparency starts on January 1st. I said to my people, “You couldn’t start it like in August, back? They said, “Sir, you have to go statutorily here, here, here.” I say, “Yeah, but I’d better win this damn election because, can you imagine, mayor, he’ll be saying, “Boy, I’m getting a lot of credit. What the hell did Trump do? This is unbelievable.” I promise you, they won’t give the credit to us. Will, they, huh? No, but I think we’re not going to have to worry about it. I hope that … get out and vote, vote, vote. To care for our nation’s veterans, I signed into law VA Choice and VA Accountability. Nobody thought that would be possible. Right? Nobody thought that would be possible.(44:17)
We’ve also invested billions and billions of dollars in research and innovative treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, kidney disease, sickle cell disease, AIDS, cancer, and many other illnesses. I will say this, AIDS will be eradicated in this country now in six years. I started right at the beginning. President Obama should have started, he could have started it two years before, or two and a half years before. They wasted two years. But we started it right at the beginning of the administration, and it was a ten-year program. We’re down to six years. In six years it will be essentially eradicated in our country. Think of that. Who would have thought that? It’s an amazing thing. It should have been started before I got into office. It could have been.(45:04)
Day after day I’m fighting to defend our seniors from the virus, from Big Pharma, oh they love me, special interests, and from the radical socialist left. American seniors, remind us that we’ve inherited an incredible, extraordinary legacy. You’re the generation that defeated Fascism and triumphed over Communism, sent American astronauts to the moon. You built our country into the greatest and most powerful nation the world has ever known. Frankly, right now it’s more powerful than it ever was. When I took over, we had a depleted military. We have now a military … we have the greatest weapons on Earth. We are the envy of the world.(45:49)
We have the greatest weapons, the missiles, rockets, tanks, the tankers, the freighters, the boats, the ships, the jet fighters, F-35s, the F-18s, F-16s. Nobody has the equipment that we have in the world. Not even close. Even the hypersonic missiles. You know? Under the Obama Administration, they stole our plans for hypersonic. That’s the super-duper, I call them the super-duper missiles. The ones that go so fast, you can’t even see them, and now we have that. You probably read about it last night. We have the fastest by far in the world.(46:29)
Now we’re doing a great job, and our seniors and generations of Americans before you, they did not pour out their heart, and soul, and blood, and tears, for this country only now to surrender our freedom, our flag, and our American way of life. You seniors have protected us, and now I as a senior and all of my people, we are protecting you. Your courage, your leadership, your patriotism, and your faith, are an inspiration to us all. With your help we will transcend every obstacle, defeat every threat, and triumph over every single challenge. We will lift our nation to new heights of greatness and glory, and America will emerge stronger, more united, more independent, and more prosperous than ever before. For our nation, for our great seniors, and for our beloved children and grandchildren, the best is yet to come. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much."
trump_proud_boys.txt,"(00:00)
Okay, thank you very much. We’re going to Minnesota. I thought the debate last night was great. We’ve gotten tremendous reviews on it. We’re hitting what people want. Law and order, which Biden was unable to even talk about because he’d lose the radical left, his radical left followers. I don’t think there’s too many of them left, but I thought it was a great evening. It was an exciting evening. I see the ratings were very high, and it was good to be there. Felt very comfortable, and I appreciate all the good words. So we are going now, and we’re going to have a big rally. A lot of people are showing up. Yeah.(01:10)
[inaudible 00:01:10] last night, when you said that the Proud Boys should stand back and stand by.(01:12)
I don’t know who the Proud Boys are. I mean, you’ll have to give me a definition, because I really don’t know who they are. I can only say they have to stand down and let law enforcement do their work. Law enforcement will do the work more and more as people see how bad this radical liberal Democrat movement is, and how weak. The law enforcement is going to come back stronger and stronger. But again, I don’t know who Proud Boys are. But whoever they are, they have to stand down, let law enforcement do their work.(01:42)
But Mr. President, did you misspeak when you said, “Stand by?” [inaudible 00:01:46](01:47)
Just stand by. Look, law enforcement will do their work. They’re going to stand down. They have to stand down. Everybody, they have to stand… Whatever group you’re talking about. Let law enforcement do the work. Now, Antifa is a real problem, because the problem is on the left and Biden refuses to talk about it. He refuses to issue the words law and order. You saw that last night when he choked up. He can’t say the words, because he’ll lose the rest of the left. So he’s got to condemn Antifa. Antifa is a very bad group. Yeah.(02:18)
So Mr. President, let me follow up. White supremacists, they clearly love you and support you. Do you welcome that?(02:19)
I want law and order to be a very important part. It’s a very important part of my campaign. And when I say that, what I’m talking about is law enforcement has to… Police have to take care, and they should stop defunding the police like they’ve done in New York, like they’ve done in New York.(02:39)
[crosstalk 00:02:38].(02:39)
I just told you.(02:40)
But do you denounce them? Do you know denounce white-(02:42)
I’ve always denounced any form, any form of any of that. You have to denounce. Joe Biden has to say something about Antifa. It’s not a philosophy. These are people that hit people over the head with baseball bats. He’s got to come out and he’s got to be strong, and he’s got to condemn Antifa. And it’s very important that he does it.(03:08)
Sir, let me ask you about Joe Biden. Can I follow up, sir, about Joe Biden, Mr. President? [inaudible 00:03:13].(03:22)
I can’t hear a word you’re saying. I can’t hear.(03:22)
[inaudible 00:03:19].(03:22)
I hear he doesn’t want to go forward, but that’s up to him. I mean-(03:25)
What about you? Are you moving forward?(03:26)
Yeah, I would like to. By every measure, we won the debate easily last night. I think he was very weak. He looked weak. He was whining. Yeah, we won the debate by almost every poll that I saw. If you look at the various polls… I looked at about six of them. We won every one of them. So, no, I don’t mind debating him. I hear he wants to get out of the debates. I don’t know, that’s up to him.(03:50)
[inaudible 00:03:54]. Does that concern you that they go out there with their weapons and walk around-(04:00)
Yeah, it does concern me. And crime generally concerns me, any form of crime. And let law enforcement take care of it.(04:12)
So we had a problem in New York. They have a hundred thousand ballots that are a mess. They were all confused, all mixed up. Now they say they’re going to redo them. Well, what are they going to do with a hundred thousand ballots that have already been sent? This is exactly what I’m talking about. It’s a big, big, big scale problem. A hundred thousand ballots went out to New York with the wrong names on them, wrong envelopes, wrong addresses, wrong everything, and now they want to redo the ballots. That doesn’t help, because what about the ones that are already sent? This is exactly what I’m talking about.(04:44)
Can I follow up to that, Mr. President? If there was an apparent Joe Biden victory come the 20th of January-(05:11)
There won’t be. There won’t be.(05:12)
Sir, what if there is? [inaudible 00:04:55], sir."
trump_rapid_tests.txt,"(00:03)
Thank you very much, thank you. So beautiful out here. And thank you for joining us as we announce a massive and groundbreaking expansion in our testing capability for the China virus. And as you know, it’s already setting records, records like nobody’s ever seen before. Last week, we crossed a historic milestone when the United States conducted our 100 millionth test, far more than any other country and not even close actually, second seems to be India with one point five billion people. And the numbers would be probably at least 50 million more tests by us. We’ve conducted more tests than the entire European Union. And more than all of Latin America combined.(00:53)
We’re thrilled to be joined by Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, hi Betsy. Administrator for the Centers for Medicine and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, Seema, and Admiral Giroir, who’s done such an incredible job, thank you, Admiral. We’re also joined by Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves, had a tremendous victory, we’re so proud of you. And as well by Abbott’s CEO, Robert Ford, Robert, thank you very much, great job. Today I’m pleased to report that we’re announcing our plan to distribute 150 million Abbott rapid point-of-care tests in the coming weeks, very, very soon. This will be more than double the number of tests already performed and here’s our plan. 50 million tests will go to protect the most vulnerable communities, which we’ve always promised to do, including 18 million for nursing homes, 15 million for assisted living facilities, 10 million for home health and hospiece care, hospice care agencies, and nearly one million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and also tribal nation colleges.(02:12)
100 million rapid point-of-care tests will be given to states and territories to support efforts to reopen their economies and schools immediately and fast as they can. For example, the support my administration is providing would allow every state to, on a very regular basis, test every teacher who needs it. This continues our critical effort to use testing to protect high-risk communities. These new Abbott rapid point-of-care tests are easy to use and return results within just minutes. You’ll have a result at a maximum 15 minutes, no machine is required to process them. So in the old days, when we just started this, you remember we’d go out and we’d have to find these massive laboratories with tremendously expensive equipment. Now we’re down to something that you’ll see that is really from a different planet. I would like to ask Admiral Giroir to come up and demonstrate how these tests are performed. You’ll do this very nicely, I think. Good luck, hope you don’t test positive. (07:54)
Thank you very much, Admiral, and let me ask you Governor Reeves, do you agree, would you like to say something? (09:47)
Thank you very much, thank you Tate, great job. In a short period of time, my administration has built the most advanced testing system in the world. There’s never been anything like this. When the pandemic struck, there were zero tests for the China virus, but we’ve marshaled all of America’s resources to achieve these unparalleled capabilities. We slashed red tape and approved emergency use authorizations for 243 type of tests. That’s how many tests we have. I invoked the Defense Production Act and related authorities more than 100 times and distributed $171 million to expand testing production. We’ve done nearly twice as much testing per capita as France, Italy, and Germany. And over six times more testing per capita than South Korea. We’ve done far more than any other country, usually times two, three, four, five, or six. We’ve performed nearly 40 million more tests than India.(10:50)
And by the end of next month, we will have over 100 million tests available in the market. More than half will be point-of-care tests. Those are the quick ones, and they’re really the ones that have the best impact, with the results in less than 15 minutes. We’ve also prioritized resources for the most vulnerable, including nursing home residents. We delivered rapid testing devices to nearly 14,000 certified nursing homes. We opened over 1,000 community testing sites in low-income communities. Nobody could have done this. We invested an unprecedented eight billion dollars to help tribal communities have the tests and resources they need to combat the virus. And it’s important to remember that as younger and healthier people return to work, and as we massively increased testing capacity, we will identify more cases and asymptomatic individuals in low-risk populations. This should not cause undue alarm, the total number of cases is not the full metric of success. Hospitalization capacity and mortality rates are far more instructive metrics.(12:03)
As we do more tests, you’re going to have automatically more cases. We are relentlessly focused on protecting the vulnerable while enabling healthy Americans to go back to work. We can do both as Florida, Arizona, and other states have recently shown. Over the last eight weeks hospitalizations have declined by 48% and they’ve just reached the lowest point since March, that’s a long time ago. Due to advances in treatment, the fatality rate has fallen 85% since April. Our excess mortality has been considerably lower than comparable countries. Excess mortality compares total deaths during a pandemic to what we would be expected in a normal year. This is a critical measurement because it includes undetected China virus deaths, along with deaths resulting from lockdowns, and lockdowns can be very harmful. And we have too many states that are locked down right now, the governors are … nobody knows what the governors are doing actually.(13:08)
Europe has experienced a 50% greater excess mortality rate during the virus than the U.S. and their economic contraction has been far more severe. Under Operation Warp Speed, my administration’s on track to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in record time. We’re doing very well with the vaccines as most of you know. Four vaccines are now in the final stage of trials. The day the vaccine is approved by the F.D.A., we’ll begin distributing it within 24 hours with hundreds of millions of doses to follow very quickly. We’re all set to go. We’re all ready and logistically we have the military lined up and some incredible people are just waiting to have it. Over 100 million doses will be available before the end of the year. We will defeat the virus and we’ll end the pandemic. And next year will be one of the greatest years in our history, and we think it’s going to be a very exciting period of time. With that, I’d like to ask Mike to say a few words, because you just left a Task Force meeting, Vice President Mike Pence. (21:19)
Thank you very much, Mike. Scott Atlas, would you say a few words please, as to how we’re doing and where you see us going, please? (23:08)
Well, thank you very much. Tremendous progress is being made and I say it and I’ll say it all the time, we’re rounding the corner. And very importantly vaccines are coming, but we’re rounding the corner regardless, but vaccines are coming and they’re coming fast. We have four great companies already, and it’s going be added to very rapidly. They’re in final stages of testing. And from what we’re hearing, the results are going to be very extraordinary. So thank you very much, I appreciate it. And thank you very much, great job by Abbott, right from the beginning, great job by Abbott. Thank you, thank you very much everybody, thank you. [crosstalk 00:23:51]."
trump_raw_dubuque_iowa_clean.txt,"(03:26)
Well thank you very much. Thank you. What a crowd. This is a very great place. We had a great victory here four years ago. And I just noticed their happened to be a poll out, that came out last night, that has a very, very substantial margin. We’re very happy with it. We’re very happy with it, and we’re very happy with Iowa, thank you very much Iowa. And we appreciate it. And we’ve had a great run together, and I’ve been working very hard with the farmers, and making them hopefully very rich. Making them very rich, and very successful, and hello to everyone here also from Wisconsin. We have a lot of people from Wisconsin.(04:12)
All right. Let’s see. Who is from Iowa? And who is from Wisconsin? All right. That’s not terrible. That’s not bad. We just left Wisconsin, and we’re going back to Wisconsin. Two days from now we are going to win Iowa and we are going to win Wisconsin. And we are going to win four more years in that very beautiful White House. With your vote we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, and ensure that more products are made, and raised, and grown in the USA. That’s what’s happening. That’s what’s happening.(04:53)
Next year we’ll be, I think we’re going to have the greatest year, economically speaking, in the history of our country. You saw the number that just came out. 33.1 GDP. That’s the best number in the history of our country. And we’re set. We call it a super V. We used to say a V, now we’re calling it a super V. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever, we’re truly something. We’re set. We’re all set. We were doing better than ever before. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country, and then we got hit by the China plague, which we’re not going to forget. (05:34)
So we closed it up, we closed it up and then we opened it up, and we saved, I’ll tell you, we saved two million lives. It was 2.2 million people, were projected, we saved two million lives. But what happened, there shouldn’t have been one life. Shouldn’t have been. And we can never forget what China did to us, we can never forget. While foreign nations are in a free fall, you see what’s going on in other lands. Look at what’s happening in Europe. It’s a shame. We’re creating the world’s greatest economic powerhouse.(06:09)
A recent Gallup Poll found that 56% of the Americans polled said that they were better off now, much better off, it’s a record, than they were four years ago under Obama and Biden. As president, I kept my promise. And I protected ethanol. And I approved E15 for use all year round. You don’t know what that means. That’s a lot. They’ve been trying to get that approved. Let me just tell you, for all of the ethanol people, and you have Joni, and you have Chuck over here, they fought with me. They were coming, they wanted it. And I said, “Can I give you just a little bit less.” “No, we won’t accept anything less.” (06:55)
That’s Chuck, and Joni. They were tough, and they were good. But they didn’t have to fight me. They didn’t have to fight too hard. I was with the farmers. I was with them from the beginning. But if Biden gets in you can forget about ethanol, you can forget about everything. (07:10)
You would have that terminated. You would have that terminated so fast. But authorized its use in existing gas pumps also, that doesn’t mean much to you, it means a lot to the ethanol people. So you have the existing gas pumps, you don’t have to go and spend a fortune to do the new gas pumps. Nobody knows that. And it doesn’t even sound very elegant in this speech. But you have the gas pumps to ethanol, and everything ends if Biden ever… It’s not going to happen with Biden, let’s face it. That’s not going to happen. That’s not going to happen. He would end everything that we’ve done. We’ve made this an incredible year.(07:46)
I got 28 billion dollars from China that went to our farmers, because they targeted you. We opened new markets for Iowa farmers and ranchers. In Japan, the EU, South Korea, and all over the world. We surged exports with the new USMCA. We got rid of your horrible, terrible, worst trade deal ever made. Everyone said that would be impossible to do, we got it done. We got a lot done. We got a lot done. By the way, do you think it could be any windier up here? (08:21)
I’m sitting here, it’s like… I’m standing up and this is one hell of a wind. It’s lucky you have a president that doesn’t need a teleprompter, because these things are useless. They’re going. Yeah. They are useless. They’re moving in 17 directions, I’m going like- (08:46)
Now, Sleepy Joe would be lost. He’d be- (08:51)
“What am I going to do?” How about this, they ask him questions, he puts on a teleprompter, gives them… I’ve never seen this one. The hardest question he had recently was, “What flavor ice cream do you have sir?” He looks down. “I think vanilla and chocolate.” “Okay, thanks.” They don’t ask me questions like that. We confronted China’s cheating and made them double their purchases. They doubled up their purchases.(09:19)
And three weeks ago you had the largest court order in the history of our country, right? This guy’s a corn guy. He’s a big corn guy, he likes Trump. You had the largest purchase of soybeans in the history of our country, and the largest beef order. You know why? Because China realized that I’m going to win. Because when you look… And they wanted to make me happy. Because what they did should not have been done.(09:46)
They dream about Sleepy Joe Biden. They own Sleepy Joe. They gave his boy a lot of money. (10:02)
Thank you. (10:02)
Ah. (10:06)
China goes, they go to bed every night and they say, “Please let it be Sleepy Joe.” (10:11)
They would own the United States. You see the whole deal with him, right? With the son, with the 1.5 billion dollars goes to the son to manage. He makes millions of dollars a year. (10:23)
Then the kid asks for 10 million a year, for recommendation purposes. He’s going to recommend. He gets 10 million. He wants 10 million a year. It’s a disgrace. (10:37)
Nah, it’s a disgrace. (10:40)
It’s a disgrace. And then he doesn’t have a job for four years, and he goes, and his father becomes vice president. And he wants $183,000 a month, right? From Ukraine. Ukraine, Burisma, oil company, not the best reputation. And then he said, “That wasn’t enough. Could we have three million dollars up front, please?” And then they get from Russia. They, Russia, Russia, Russia. Oh, by the way, the laptop from hell, all of a sudden- (11:13)
Shifty Schiff, with the watermelon head, right Joe? (11:17)
He comes out, [inaudible 00:11:18] Schiff. He comes out and he said, “I think the laptop was developed by Russia.” (11:27)
Russia’s probably going, “Oh my, here we go again with the-” (11:31)
Can you imagine that? Three years, no collusion. 48 million dollars. A friend of mine said, “You’ve got to be the cleanest guy in the world. No collusion, no nothing. A waste of 48 million, three years, what a disgrace.” (11:45)
And then they say, “The laptop came from Russia.” No, the laptop came from… Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? (11:53)
It’s called the laptop from hell. (11:56)
How about though, the mayor of Moscow’s wife. Gives Hunter a check for 3.5 million dollars. He didn’t have a job. He was just… His father became vice president and he became… They were raking in money. And the father was supposed to get 10%, right? And then in another case he was supposed to get 50%. And the media doesn’t want to talk about it. (12:21)
They put silence on it. (12:24)
They put silence on it. And big tech, they’ll have to do something with Section 230 Chuck, I’ll tell you. They’re going to have to do something with Section 230, because what’s going on is bad. What’s going on could kill this country. They have to do something with Section 230. It’s time we stopped talking about it and get it done. We passed record… Because they wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for Section… We gave them this unbelievable gift of no liability, and they’ve abused it, they’ve totally abused it.(12:56)
We passed record middle class tax cuts. And we virtually eliminated the estate tax, so you don’t have a death tax. When you die, and at some point that’ll happen, there’s a couple of guys right here. Let’s see, eh. (13:10)
When you die and you have a beautiful farm and you want to leave it to your kids, right? In the old days the kids would have to pay tax, and they’d go out and borrow the money, and then two years comes along and they end up losing the farm. No estate tax, no death tax, thank Chuck Grassley, and thank Joni Ernst, right? It’s a big deal. You don’t have the death tax, or the estate tax. It’s a big deal. Now, if you love your children… Who loves your children here? Okay. And who does not love your child or children? (13:46)
There’s one hand of a woman in the very back. (13:51)
So, if you don’t love them, it doesn’t matter that much, okay? (13:55)
If you do, I did you one hell of a favor. You better remember that. We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. No one has fought harder for the people of Iowa. That’s true. For the people, for the farmers. I fought for the farmers, for the ranchers. And China went after you, but I got the money for you because I got it a different way.(14:17)
I spoke with our great Secretary of Agriculture, who I think is great, Sonny Perdue, he knows more about farming and agriculture. I said, “Sonny, how much did they hurt us two years ago?” He said, “12 billion dollars.” ” How much last year?” “16 billion.” I said, “Good. Take 28 billion dollars and we’re giving it…” I think it was proportioned right, I hope it was, I don’t know. Did anybody get a bad deal? Did anybody? Because you’re all wealthy. (14:44)
But we took 28 billion dollars and we gave it to the farmers. And that’s why you’re all here, and that’s why you’re all happy. And no other president would’ve done that. And we had a lot of money leftover, because we tariffed China a lot of money. And they paid for it, you didn’t pay. The fake news likes to say you paid. You don’t pay, they paid. They devalued their currency even further and they paid. We got 28 billion dollars for our farmers, and I’m very happy about it, and so are they.(15:12)
For decades, Joe Biden let other countries rip you off, rip off our country, and cheat America blind. And there was a group, they were just, they would let them do anything. Biden has been there for five decades. And the only people who benefited from his policies were himself and his family, frankly. (15:32)
He shows up every four years and then goes back the Washington and caters to special interests. But my only interest is you. It’s very interesting. He’s raising… This sleepy guy is raising a lot of money, right? So he raises money. You know how he raises money? By making deals. That’s how you raise money. I would be the greatest political fundraiser in the history of the world. I could raise a billion dollars and give me two days. (15:59)
Give me an extra day just in case. (16:02)
All I have to do is, “Hey.” I know most of these guys one way or the other. “President of the United States is calling Mr. So-And-So from Goldman Sachs, etc.” “President.” “Oh, do me a favor send me 25 million please, for the campaign.” “Yes sir.” I would get… They wouldn’t even negotiate. I’d get so much, and I didn’t do any of it, right? And we did very nicely. We got a lot of small donations. But I didn’t do any of it, I never made a call. I never made a call. Everybody I called would give, I’m the president, I mean, unless you’re stupid you’re able to get a lot of money. (16:37)
“Send me 10.” “Well sir, we’re having a hard time.” “All right. Send me five. That’s okay. Send me five.” I would’ve raised a billion dollars. But you can only spend so much. You can only buy so many commercials. We’ve got so many commercials, they have so many. But if Biden Harris… How about Harris? How about Harris? (16:56)
Kamala, Kamala. You have to pronounce her name right. It’s Kamala, like a comma, Kamala. (17:02)
And yet she pronounces her name differently than that, doesn’t she, huh? Did Mike Pence beat her in the debate or what? Did anybody see the debate last week? Our debate? Right? Everything he’d say, I’d say, “Well why didn’t you do it Joe?” “Well, he should’ve done that.” Really? First of all, everything I have done. I said, “Joe. You were there for 47 years and you only left 3.5 years ago. Why didn’t you do it Joe?” “Well, I never thought of that.” (17:39)
But if Biden and Harris, the radical left, gain power, they will crash the economy, destroy your farms, and all of the things I got you, like the estate tax. That’s going to be ended. They don’t want that. They fought us on that. And then America as we know it, you’ll have a socialist country. And America will never be a socialist country. Biden has vowed to abolish the American oil industry. This would be a death sentence, as you know, for ethanol. So all of those people I’ve gotten to know. I’ve gotten to know a lot of the ethanol people through Chuck and Joni and Kim, all of them. Yep, by the way, you do have a great governor, you know that right? I don’t even know. I don’t even know if she’s here. Is she here? There she is. I can’t see her under all that stuff. (18:25)
Well, she’s definitely wearing a mask, I will say that. (18:28)
She’s a great governor. The Biden Harris plan would outlaw American energy, would unleash economic misery for Iowa, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and every other state in America. Your energy costs would go up at a level that you’ve never seen. He wants to raise your taxes. And it’s not him. He has no clue. He’s shot, okay? (18:52)
The guy has no clue. You know it, I know it, we’re all trying to be nice. But I knew him also for a while, he’s not a nice guy. If he was I wouldn’t talk this way. He’s the only man that ever-(19:03)
… if he was, I wouldn’t talk this way. He’s the only man that I’ve ever seen, his whole campaign is, “We will raise your taxes.” I said I’ve never heard of it. All my life I’ve watched politicians, I grew up with politicians, they’re always saying, “We’ll cut your taxes.” He’s the only guy I know that says, “We’re going to raise your taxes.” So I cut your taxes with them, the highest level cut in the history of our country. He wants to raise your taxes more than anybody has ever raised your taxes. Let me just ask you, how do you get elected? I mean, aside from right, wrong, how do you get elected? So he wants to give you the largest tax increase in history. Now for one year he went along the [inaudible 00:19:48] he had 27 people running, right? Some ran well, some didn’t go so good. Well, Kamala didn’t do well, she was dropping like a rock and she was mean to him.(19:59)
And everybody’s against fracking, okay? It doesn’t pertain to you, but it does as your energy cost because you want your bills to be low, so he’s going, “No frack, no frack, no fracking. There will be no fracking.” We’ve got a little play. I don’t know if they put it, they did, we spent the money for Iowa, look, see that? That board is expensive as hell. Whoa. Hey, Iowa must be a very important place. We’ve got a little show. We’ve got a little show. Look how beautiful. You see a beautiful board, I see a lot of money was spent on that. Wait until you see it, it’s incredible what they can do for money, but you’re going to see it in a second. But he goes, “No fracking,” for a year. “No fracking, there will be no fracking.” So he said this 100 times and then he goes to Pennsylvania and he goes, “I believe in fracking. We will have fracking.” And the fake news, look at all of them back there, every one of them, they’re fake and they’re more fake now than they ever were.(21:02)
When are you going to look into Moscow and the three and a half million? When are you going to ask Moscow? I want to find out why did Moscow give where’s Hunter three and a half million? It must be his expertise. Where is Hunter by the way? Remember I said, “Where’s Hunter, is he here?” And then the next day they made a T-shirt. It was the number shirt of the year, where’s Hunter? No, but we want them to ask that question instead of what flavor ice cream are you having? They’ll terminate your school choice, eliminate your charter schools to fund religious schools, ban prayer in schools, indoctrinate your children, anti-American lies and force you to subsidize extreme late term abortion, that’s what they’re doing. That’s all in their platform, you got to read it. We call the manifesto between crazy Bernie, yeah, Bernie whose one of the greatest losers of all time. No, think of it. They stole two elections, not one. I’ve seen people where an election got stolen and by the way, we’re not going to let that happen to us with these ballots.(22:16)
How about the Supreme Court ruling where the Supreme Court, no, this was not good, the Supreme Court gave them more time, more time. So what does this mean? Does this mean we go and we wait, so it’s not November 3rd, it’s going to be much later than that? No, no, we should know the result of the election on November 3rd, the evening of November 3rd. That’s the way it’s been and that’s the way it should be. What’s going on in this country? What’s going on? We believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Biden and Harris will eliminate the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans, their socialist takeover will ration care and force you onto endless wait lists. You’re going to have wait lists, you know what we’ve done by the way for the military has been incredible. We’ve gotten rid of the wait list for our veterans.(23:14)
Our opponents would pack the Supreme court with far-left justices and by the way, we’re into the voting now. It’s ridiculous, I liked election day and most of you do too, who is going to vote on election day? Okay. And who’s already voted? Okay. And you sent ballots in? Be careful with the ballots, be careful. Just be careful with those ballots, I don’t know. Our opponents would pack the court, but remember, a lot of people have already been, he has never said if he’s going to pack the court, he’s getting along the tap, tap, he’s doing a little tap, tap, tap. So he has not said until he says he’s not going to do that, you can’t vote for him and then on top of it, I created a list of 25, now it’s 45 and we just got a great one approved, these two approved them. Amy is going to be fantastic, right? Amy, they all love Amy. She’s going to be a fantastic, for a long time a Justice of the Supreme Court, she’s going to be there.(24:18)
And we picked two other great ones and we’re very happy. We have three Justices of the Supreme Court. Many Presidents have never had a pick, they’ve never had a pick and I’ve had three, that’s just blowing their mind. Look, they’re saying, “How the hell did this happen? This guy is driving us crazy.” Well, the other thing we’ve done is, thank you to President Obama, he was unable to get anybody approved, he waited so long and we had little help too with the Senate to put it mildly, but he waited so long if you go early enough, you’ll get them through. And we ended up with 142 federal judges, but that’s nothing. So we’ll have, by the end of my first term, we’re going to have almost 300, could be more, 300 approximately 300 federal judges. So that’s 300 federal judges, three Justices of the United States Supreme Court. But Bernie never created a list, I have a list, so I take one from the list. People didn’t like it, they don’t vote for it because it’s they say the most important thing that a President does is Supreme Court Justices and judges. And he hasn’t given us the answer yet and he hasn’t given us a list and he can’t because they want far left maniacs and he won’t be able to get the votes. So you know what? He’s tapping you along, he doesn’t know he’s doing it, but he’s actually doing a very good job of it because people are voting and he still hasn’t given a list and he hasn’t said whether or not he’s going to pack the court. Look, nobody in this group is voting for this guy, nobody. He’s not qualified, he wasn’t Qualified in primetime, 25 years ago, he wasn’t qualified because he was never known as being the brightest bulb in the Lot. When it comes to your second amendment, they want to shred it. They want to abolish religious liberty and they want to ban God from the public square and you’ve seen that. So the Pledge of Allegiance during the Democrat convention, right? See, it’s supposed to be democratic, but it’s really not, it’s Democrat. Doesn’t sound as good that’s why I use it all the time.(26:42)
No, it should be the Democrat, they should change their name it sounds nicer, I hate to even say it, but the Democrat convention or the Pledge of Allegiance they took the word God out and I heard it I said, “Oh,” you know that, I heard it and I said, “Oh, they must’ve made a mistake. They had a typo maybe, we’ll call it a typo.” And then I heard it a second time. And I think by the way, God is looking at us and saying, “We want to give you a nice, cool day today,” because that wind, I don’t know about you, but that wind is hitting me hard.(27:14)
Look at these flags. Why the hell did my people put the stage right here for? And there’s the great Ivanka Trump who’s standing right there. Come here, Ivanka, come here. My poor daughter, she’s standing there freezing. Iowa’s not like this all the time, they wouldn’t grow great corn if it was like this. Look at that, it’s Ivanka Trump. Wow. I looked over here, I’m looking at the flags, those beautiful American flags that we love and respect and I see my daughter. Hello Ivanka. Would you like to hear from Ivanka? Come on.(28:03)
Hello, Iowa. This is some serious energy and a little bit of cold, but you all warm up the room. Well, I love you and we all love this man, a warrior through and through who never forgets why he’s in Washington, why he ran for President and who he’s fighting for, which is you, the American people. What he has been able to accomplish in four years is extraordinary, but you know what? He’ll do that and then some if given another term, which you’re going to bring him to. He fights so hard for each of us every day and now we can fight for him and the future of this great country by using our voice and using our vote to win another historic victory for the people’s President. Get out and vote everyone. Thank you, God bless(29:18)
That’s Ivanka. I said, “Ivanka, go down here. It’s warmer.” (29:26)
Thank you. Boy, it looked cold out there. She’s all by herself under the flags. I said, “Stand next to Chuck Grassley where it’s nice and warm.” Chuck will keep you warm. He’s great. He’s a great guy, I’ll tell you that. The Biden/Harris agenda is they war on workers, they war on faith and a war on our police. To defend your God-given rights I appointed justice, Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. We will defend, protect and preserve the American way of life. Joe Biden is the candidate of rioters, looters, arsonists, it’s hard to believe but you take a look at what’s going on in Philadelphia, he doesn’t even want to condemn it. Gun grabbers, flag burners, Marxists, lobbyists, and special interest. Other than that, he’s not a bad guy, right?(30:21)
I’m the candidate of farmers, factory workers, police officers, hardworking people, law abiding patriots and every race, religion, color, and creed. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, that’s because I’m not a politician, thank you. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody has ever fought before. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and we know that, we know that, we have found that out. You don’t have to take my word for it. I’ve done something for you today that you’re going to love. Roll that screen right there, roll it.1:15)
My problem is I voted for NAFTA. I’m supporting NAFTA because I think it’s a positive thing to do and I do not pretend to be an expert on international trade matters. (35:39)
Oh, we save a lot of words, don’t we? We save a lot of words. Our country has such unbelievable potential, let’s not blow it, go vote. This election is a choice between a Biden depression or a Trump super boom, we’re going to be booming. We’re going to have the greatest year, you had the best year we’ve ever had last year, we’re going to have the best year next year, we’re set for it. It’s a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown, he wants to lockdown, we’re never locking down or a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic and frankly, we’re going to end it any way. The vaccine’s are coming, they’re coming in a matter of weeks. It’s all set, we’re going to be delivering them to our elderly, we’re going to start with the elderly, the military, logistically are the best in the world, they’re going to be delivering it. And without the vaccine, you can have the vaccine, but without it, we’re rounding the corner. (36:51)
Thank you. (36:52)
Thank you. (36:57)
That’s really nice, I’ll tell you. That’s never been a chant that anybody’s ever heard. Even Chuck Grassley has never heard. We love Chuck Grassley, don’t we? No, but I’ve never heard of that one, Chuck. Not Reagan, not anybody, they’ve never heard, so it’s good. I appreciate it very much and I love you too, I do. We’ve developed groundbreaking therapeutics, excuse me, here I am. I took something that was pretty good because I woke up and I said, “I feel great, boom, Superman, right?” That’s true. And the first lady got it and Baron got it, now Barron’s a young guy, 14 and the doctor came to see me and he said, “Sir, your son tested positive.” I said, “For what? Tested positive for what?” “For COVID.” I think he used COVID, there’s about 29 different names we can use, the China plague. I think he used COVID, “He tested for COVID,” and I go, “Wow, that’s bad, that’s not good.”(38:02)
Wow. That’s bad. That’s not good. 12 minutes later I saw the great White House doctor. “How’s Barron doing?” “Oh, he’s okay. He shed it. No problem.” So like 12 minutes. I said, “Barron, you feeling okay?” “Yeah, what was wrong? I had nothing wrong with me.” Young kids have a strong immune system, they knock the hell out of it. Send your kids back to school. We want to go back to school, right? For those states, Pennsylvania, frankly, the governor very bad lock down, and North Carolina, we’re winning in North Carolina, by the way, you know what’s going on, right? We’re winning in Florida. We’re winning in North Carolina. We’re winning in Pennsylvania. I think they’ve given up in Ohio. I think they’ve given up in Florida, frankly. And I think after the poll I saw from that very nice newspaper, that usually doesn’t treat me so well, but they treated me very well. I think maybe they’re going to give up on a place called Iowa pretty soon, too. I think they’ll give up on Iowa pretty soon.(39:02)
We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks and we will quickly eradicate the virus, wipe out the China plague. We just want to get back to normal. That’s all we want. We don’t want much. We don’t want much. Just, let’s get back to normal. We had the greatest economy seven months ago, and then we had the plague. That’s not good. Think of what China has done to the world. Think of it. Now, just think. I see people that come in, they’re wrapped up in masks and, how you doing? Don’t touch. Don’t get close. Seriously, think of what China has done to the world. I had a group of people, not so long ago at a place, nice place. And they said, “President, President, could we say hello?” They’re wrapped in masks and it’s terrible. And they said, you couldn’t hear him because the mask. One person had the world’s thickest mask I’ve ever seen. I mean, and then the scientists was there. That one’s no good. That one’s okay.(40:04)
But they’re saying, “President, President.” Successful people, good people. And I’m saying, “Look at these people.” I said, “Look at these people.” What China has done to us, but what China has done to the whole world, they could have kept it in. They kept it in from China, they had the Wuhan province, they kept it in. But it got out to Europe, to the US, and all over the world. Think of what they’ve done to us. Forget about their trade deal with your corn, okay? On the bigger picture, we did that great trade deal, but the ink wasn’t even dry. And all of a sudden, we got hit by this damn plague and we won’t forget it. We’re not forgetting it. And you can never forget it. We can never forget it.(40:50)
The Biden plan will turn America into a prison state, locking you down while letting the far left rioters roam free to loot and burn. Think of it. Think of it. You can’t go to church. You can’t go to school. You can’t do anything. You have to stay in your house. But if you’re a looter, an anarchist, a rioter, you can run down the streets of Portland. You can run down the streets of anywhere you want. And there you have no problems. In fact, we got to a point because we were shut out from having protests, right? Rallies. So they said, “Well, you can’t have a rally, sir. You’re not allowed to have anything political.” I said, “What can you do?” The only thing you’re allowed to do is protest. I said, “Good. Let’s call our rallies from now on, protests.”(41:38)
So this is a protest. We are protesting, but your governor wouldn’t do that to us. We don’t have to worry about Iowa. We don’t have to worry about Iowa. No, but you have some places, Minnesota. You saw that, we had 25,000 people that wanted to be there. And the attorney general, well, I will say one thing about him. He was the first one, I think, or just about, him and one other person. On day one, he said, this is four years ago, “You know that Trump is going to win, don’t you?” They said, “What do you mean?” He said, “Trump is going to win.” So in one way, can’t be so stupid, right? But the attorney general and the Governor of Minnesota said, “No, we can only allow 250 people.” We had 25,000 people that wanted to go. So I went there and they thought that I’d cancel for 250 people, because we’re drawing 25, 30, 40,000 people to every rally. So they figured I’d cancel. I said, “Nope, we’re not going to cancel on Minnesota.” Minnesota hasn’t been won by a Republican since 1972. And we’re going to win Minnesota because of that.(42:52)
And actually, had we had the rally, we’d have 25, 30,000 people there. Thousands of people showed up and the governor had them locked out. Frankly, that was a much bigger statement than if we had the rally. If we had a rally, we would have had a big, beautiful rally, but it was a big statement. But between that and Omar, Ilhan Omar, she’s a real winner. Ilhan Omar, who obviously hates our country. She likes to tell us how to run our country. How the hell she gets elected anyways, hard to believe, but she’s in Minnesota. And the other thing is we stopped, I said, “You got to let the National Guard in,” they have to ask us, right? I said, “You got to let in the National Guard.” Well, a week and a half later, they let the National Guard in, and we stopped in, what would you say, 22 minutes? Remember, wasn’t that beautiful?(43:46)
I mean, look, sometime, this week and a half they’re burning down Minneapolis, burning it down and CNN’s covering it. That reporter, he got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas. [inaudible 00:06:00], he said, “I’m down, I got hit.” Don’t worry. It was only tear gas on the knee, he was down. But he was saying, “This is a friendly protest.” And you looked over his shoulder, right? The entire city was burning down. Did you see that? There’s a famous picture, the thing must’ve been like 10 blocks long. They should have called us sooner, but we put it out in about 15 minutes, maybe 20. That was a beautiful sight though, they just came in one, two, three, then all of a sudden more, more, you could just see the busloads. And they walked down that street with pepper spray and tear gas. And it was pow, pow. Everybody got, I’m telling you, less than a half an hour. It was all over. That thing lasted for two weeks.(44:44)
Biden calls these lockdowns a dark winter. Wasn’t he inspiring at the debate? How bad was he? Look, I’ve debated guys that had intelligence. Look, I had a debate crooked Hillary four years ago, but I mean, at least she was as an intelligent person, she’s gone a little wacko. No, Hillary, you lost. Remember she said to me, “Will you respect the decision of the people?” And I sort of said, “Maybe.” I wasn’t perfect. I said, “Maybe, if there’s no cheating.” We have to be careful with cheating, right? But then she didn’t respect. And what did they do? They went on a witch hunt for years and years and they spied on my campaign and we caught them spying on the campaign. And now they say, “Will you respect the decision over the voters? And will there be a friendly transition?”(45:37)
First of all, there’s not going to be a transition, we’re winning. But then you say, then you say, “Well, let me ask you. Four years ago, was there a friendly transition?” They were spying on my campaign before I even won. And what was worse was they were spying on my campaign after I won, to overthrow the President of the United States, okay? Which is called treason, which is called treason. And let’s see what the hell happens. I don’t know why it takes so long, but it takes a long time. I’ll tell you that man right there, Chuck Grassley is one of the most effective people. He’s one of the people that, he’s one of the people that does not want to let them get away with it. And I appreciate it, you know that. No, he’s one of the most effective guys. He was the man. He looked at Comey. Remember when Comey lied in front of Congress? He looked at Comey, he said, “Did you leak?”(46:36)
Chuck is tough, when he’s talking regular he’s the toughest guy in the room. And Comey’s a liar. Worst Director in the history of the FBI, beyond the worst director. He was a bad guy. But Chuck Grassley is interviewing him, ask him. Then he looks at him, “One more question,” sort of like Columbo, right? I have one more question. Remember Columbo, hey, hey, hey, just one extra little question. So here he is, perry Mason also, always the last question, that was true. That was true during the debate, when he said the oil. I said, “Whoa, this is the biggest question of the night.” But with Chuck, he said, “Did you leak?” “What?” “Did you leak?” “Ah, yes. Yes I did.” And I’m sitting there saying, “I don’t believe this.”(47:27)
Oh, we love Chuck. What a piece of work Chuck is. What a piece of work that man is. I like that guy. He’s tough as hell though. It’s true. I guess I was only giving the ethanol guys 99%, and Chuck couldn’t stand that, he wanted them. He wanted you people to get 100%, right? I said, “Chuck, I’ve got the papers all ready to sign.” “I don’t like them.” “Why?” “You didn’t get that one little thing, that one little morsel for the other side.” A little morsel right for the other side. Happened to be the oil industry. I said, “Could we give them something?” And it wasn’t any good. We love you, man. We love you. He ended up getting a hundred percent. But it all goes away with Sleepy Joe, just to remember that, Chuck.(48:17)
The Biden lockdown will result in countless deaths, destroy millions in small businesses and wipe out an entire generation of hopes and dreams. Earlier today, one of his top advisors again confirmed their desire for a shutdown. The damage to children, you know that, you saw that, it was in the news. They want to shut it down. I don’t know. These people are crazy. We’ve got a thing that’s rocking and rolling. And it doesn’t work. The damage this will inflict on children, teenagers and young adults is absolutely cruel. The far left has always yearned to wield the unchecked power. That’s what they want is the power. I think it’s more than the power. I think it is the power and maybe the money. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life, then you cast your ballot for me and you have to do it on November 3rd.(49:13)
You got to get over there, joining us today, got to get it done. We got to get it done. We got to get this election behind us and get to work. We have some great people in government. We have some great people that want to come into government, and our nation has unbelievable potential. I didn’t watch much of Biden’s speech. He made a little speech, little tiny. He does very short speeches, very short, they’re the shortest speeches I’ve ever seen, actually. He just wants to go home to the basement. He doesn’t want to be. He is the most unhappy warrior I’ve ever. Did you ever see? He’s agitated, he’s just angry and agitated and he doesn’t want to be there. And now he’s starting to lose in the polls and it’s driving him crazy. So what does he do? He brings in Barack Hussein Obama and you know what happened to his attendance? It went down, his attendance, it actually brought it down.(50:10)
They called and they said the other day, a couple of weeks ago, they said, “Sir, have a little bad news.” “What?” “Barack Hussein Obama is going to a campaign with Biden.” I said, “Why is that bad news? That’s good news. He campaigned with Hillary, and that was when she started really getting beaten.” Remember that? He campaigned. He’s a highly overrated person. Well, he gave us 142 judgeships, we’ll take it.(50:36)
Joining us today are some incredible people. And if they want to come up and freeze their ass off, they’re fine to come up. See you people are there and you’re nice and warm. I’m up here all by myself. That’s why I said, I said to my daughter, oh look, is that Hope Hicks? Where’s Hope Hicks, the great Hope Hicks. Get her. Is that Sarah Huckabee? You look like, come here, Sarah. You know what? You look like Hope Hicks. I thought Sarah Huckabee was Hope Hicks. Come up here Hope Hicks. The great Hope Hicks. Boy, we got them all. Come here, Sarah. How good is Sarah? Look at Sarah. Come up here, Sarah. Look at Sarah. She did pretty well being with Trump, right?e: (51:33)
Thank you, Mr. President, how good does that sound? President Trump. He’s had an amazing four years. As a mom of three young kids, there’s nobody I trust more to build their future and protect our great country than President Donald Trump. We need everybody here to make sure they get out, because this is the most important election we’ve ever had. Everything is on the line and the only person strong enough, tough enough, and willing to fight for it is President Donald Trump. I’m so proud to be here. Thank you so much, Mr. President.(52:18)
You want to go down here? It’s warmer. Thank you. Thank you, Sarah. She could be Governor of Arkansas one day. I don’t know. Is that? Where’s Hope? Come here Hope. You know Hope, Hope Hicks. Come here Hope, come up here. The great Hope Hicks. Do you know Hope Hicks? She’s become very famous, very powerful woman. Very powerful. Look at her. Are you cold enough, Hope? Come on up, Hope. Are you having a good time?53:12)
Yes sir.(53:13)
She does a fantastic job. I don’t know if she loves public speaking, just say hello.53:21)
Hi. How much do we love our president? Are you guys going to vote on Tuesday? Who are you going to vote for? We love you Iowa. Thank you.(53:43)
Thank you. Good job. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks Hope. So we have a person that you know very well, who’s considered one of the best governors in our country and she is, and I work with her. She’s another one. She’s unrelenting. You had a little flooding problem, to put it mildly. You were like a swimming pool for a period of time. And Kim was on the phone. “Sir, we need money for the dykes, the dams,” whatever the hell we were calling them. “We got to get money.” And I said, “All right, Kim, is this enough?” “No sir, we got to have more and more and more and more,” but that’s what a good governor is, right? The ones that don’t call, they’re not as good, but we don’t want to tell them that. But she’s really considered one of the greatest governors in our country. And she’s a great person. A great husband, she’s got a great warrior husband too. I will tell you that. Kim Reynolds. Come on up Kim, if you can. Come on up.(54:50)
Welcome back to Iowa. We’re so proud to have you here. And I’ve told you every time I had the opportunity to be in front of you, that we were going to carry Iowa for Donald J. Trump, and we are going to bring it home. We’re not satisfied with seven, we’re going for 10. We’re going to bring it home. Thank you. Thank you for everything. Thank you.(55:13)
Thanks Kim. Great job. Thank you, Kim. She’s a dynamo, huh? Wow. I would say, whoa. Thank you, Kim. And Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg, Adam, thank you very much. Thank you. Doing a great job, Adam. Are we doing okay Adam? We’re doing good? Good. Bring it home Adam. Also with us, are two people, one is running and the other one doesn’t even have to run, even when he’s running. They say he might be the only politician in America who’s just not beatable. People don’t even run against him. He’s a great guy, but let’s get, because we have to do this. We have to get Joni Ernst elected. She’s fantastic. She’s so good. Joni, come up. Joni is fantastic and special woman, and she loves your state and she loves our country. Joni, please.56:08)
Thank you. And President Trump, we love you. Thank you so much. God bless you. There is not a finer president, and one that has done so much for our farmers and our ranchers and our biofuel producers. President Trump, Iowa loves you. I love you. God bless you. Four more years. Four more years.(56:36)
Thank you Joni. Thank you, Joni. Yeah. Get out and vote for Joni. She’s a terrific person and she really fights hard for the state, she really does. She really goes all at it. And the man that we’ve been talking a lot about today, I’ve talked about him so much and everybody knows who he is. Everybody in Washington respects him. Most people are deathly afraid of him, but I’ve gotten to know him. Actually, when you get to know him, he’s actually tougher than you even think-(57:03)
Actually, when you get to know him, he’s actually tougher than you even think. But he’s a great man. He really is. He’s a great man. He’s been a great senator. I think somebody said he’s never missed a vote in all these years. And I’d love to have… either stay there or come right up here, Chuck. But we would love to have you. Chuck Grassley, really a legendary guy. A legendary guy. He really is. He’s something special.y: (57:32)
While we were warming up the crowd for you in this cold day, and I think that’s an impossible task. But I said the four words that ought to be the most used for you to be reelected is, promises made, promises kept. And one of the things that you didn’t make a promise on that has really materialized anyway… and that is your leadership in peace in the Middle East. And nominated by three parliamentarians, other countries, for the Nobel Peace Prize. That’s pretty darn good. And you’re going to continue to work for peace.(58:21)
That’s right. I am.y: (58:22)
Yeah, and we thank you very much. Iowa’s going to go for you big time, and we’re going to have such a successful election that CNN and MSNBC is going to have to change their policies when they realized for four years that they couldn’t get you out of office, and the people back you up, you’ll be in there and they’ll have to change.(58:57)
Thank you very much. Great job, Chuck. Thank you. Unique man. Great guy. Agricultural secretary Mike Nagy. Where’s Mike? Where’s Mike? Thank you, Mike. How’s it going? Okay. Your agriculture is strong. You got a check for 28 billion, your percentage, right? How did you split that up? But you did a good job. And somebody that happens to have a very good end named Pat Grassley. You know, Pat? Pat Grassley… We talked about that. What good genes he’s got? And another man who has done a fantastic job. I hope he’s here. But he was your governor for 24 years. He set the record. And he told me a story. A story that many, many years ago, he met a man in China, and he came home and he told his wife, they were young men together, and they were buying corn or… One was a buyer. One was a seller. I don’t know how the hell it worked.(59:59)
But he met a man, and his name was Xi. His last name Xi. Then he came home years ago, many years ago, and he told his wife, “I have just met a future president of China.” And they were friends after that. And it turns out to be President Xi, current president Xi, the president of China. And when I met President Xi, he said, “Terry Branstad, the governor, is a very good friend of mine. We’ve known each other for 35 years.” So, Terry becomes governor again… 24 years. Longest serving governor in the history of the country. Okay. When you’re a governor for 24 years, that’s a long time. And I called him, in the middle of his term. I said, “Terry, they like you and China. President Xi has great respect for you. How would you like to be the ambassador to China,” and he said, “You know, sir, I think after 24 years, maybe it’s time.” And he represented us so well. He is so smart and so tough. And so we’re a… Come on up here, Terry. What a great job he’s done. So he wanted to come back, and he wanted to make sure that we get reelected. That’s what he wanted to do. But what a job he’s done. Thank you very much. Please.d: (01:01:18)
Mr. President, we are so honored to have you in Dubuque on the Sunday before the election. On the Sunday before the election four years ago, you were in Sioux City, and we’re glad that you’ve come back the Sunday before the election this time. The polls have you in the same position, seven points up over your opponent.d: (01:01:42)
But what I want the people of Iowa and American to know is nobody had the courage to stand up to the Chinese like President Donald Trump. And it’s made a real difference. He asked Xi if he would make all of Fentanyl a controlled substance, and it’s saving thousands of lives in America. He had the courage to put sanctions on the Chinese to get us a fair reciprocal trade agreement, which we’d never had before. And it’s already risen the price of corn a dollar a bushel. Soybeans are over $10. They made record purchases. We need a strong president, and Trump is the one that can do the job for the next four years. I’m proud to be back in Iowa, proud to be back in America, and here to support Donald Trump, Joni Ernst and our entire team.(01:02:52)
Great job. Thank you. What a great guy. We have great… You have great people. There’s a lot good genes in this state, right? Thank you very much. Is Eric here? Is your son here? Where’s… Where? Oh look at you. I didn’t recognize you with that big, beautiful hat on. Are you doing good? Are we doing okay? That’s great. He has a father who’s very proud of him, I have to tell you. Thank you, Eric. Great job you’re doing.(01:03:18)
And Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann. He’s been fantastic from day one. Thank you, Jeff. It looks good, Jeff, huh? Looking good, Jeff. Take it through. You bring it through, Jeff. I have no doubt about you. He’s a great chairman. One of the best. Congressional candidates, Ashley Hinson, who’s unbelievable. Come here quick, Ashley. Come here, Ashley. And Mariannette Miller-Meeks, and Esther Joy King. Come on up here. Come on. Get up here. Say a couple of words because you are doing fantastic [inaudible 01:03:56].: (01:03:56)
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for coming back to Iowa. Iowa is Trump country. We want to tell you we’ve been traveling throughout the state, Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Esther Joy King. We are going to take these seats back, because what we want to do, we want to fire Nancy Pelosi. You need a partner in Congress so you can get your MAGA agenda done, and we are going to be there for you, Mr. President. So thank you for coming to Iowa.(01:04:23)
Thank you. Thank you.iller-Meeks : (01:04:26)
Thank you. Our first vote, Mr. President, will be for Speaker of the House, and we’re going to say to Nancy Pelosi, “You’re fired.”ng: (01:04:38)
Nice to meet you, sir.(01:04:40)
Nice to meet you.ng: (01:04:44)
As a soldier in the United States Army Reserve, I just want to say thank you, thank you for your support for the military, sir.(01:04:54)
Great. Thank you very much. Great people. Really great people. And we have, we’ve rebuilt the entire military. We’ve rebuilt it over three and a half years, and that’s why we can’t worry too much about budgets. They can’t say, “Gee, we kept within budget,” but who are those people running up the White House lawn? We don’t like that, right? Now we have the strongest military now that we’ve ever had. Strongest in the world, by far.(01:05:19)
Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in American history. As you probably know, the wall, which they no longer want to talk about… The wall is almost complete. We did 412 miles. We’re doing approximately 10 miles a week, and it’s done to the highest standard what the border patrol desired, and it has been amazing. And we have now the safest Southern border, and Joni and Chuck worked very much with me on that, and it’s been amazing. We really had a great success. That’s why you don’t hear about it anymore. That’s why you don’t hear about it anymore. They used to love it when they didn’t think we’d get it built. We had a hard time. That was a hard one. The Democrats were a wall. They were their own wall. Remember they said walls don’t work. I said, “walls work and wheels work,” right? Everything else becomes obsolete very quickly.(01:06:11)
Joe Biden is fledged to free healthcare for illegal aliens. That would bankrupt your Medicare, and totally bankrupt, destroy Social Security. I will always protect Medicare and Social Security. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. Military. We now have the greatest equipment we’ve ever had. We have the greatest equipment anywhere in the world. We are the envy of the world, Russia, China, North Korea. We are the envy.(01:06:41)
We have the best planes, the best fighter jets, F-35 Stealth. You can’t see them. They’re very, very tough to see. Very tough to beat a plane in the air when you can’t see it. But we have the best planes, the best ships… Submarines, we’re doing submarines like nobody’s ever seen before. We have the best rockets and missiles. We have the best of everything. And our nuclear now is tippy top. And just hope to God we never have to use it. You know that, right? You know that. And the best way that we won’t have to use it is to have it in shape like we have it now. But we have the best equipments. We have the hypersonic missiles that go seven times faster than the world’s current fastest missile. And these were things that should have been done before me, but they didn’t decide to do that. So it’s one of those things. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability for our veterans. Nobody thought that could be done. We took out 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria, and we killed the leader of ISIS Al-Baghdadi. They were looking for him for a long time. We took out the mass murder of U.S. troops and many other people. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.(01:08:11)
I also recognized Israeli sovereignship over the Golan Heights. They worked 52 years and we got it done in two hours, approximately. And instead of endless war in the… And when you look, this is what Chuck was just saying… What we’re doing… It’s amazing what we’re doing. We have three countries signed up. We have many… they’re all coming in. We’re forging peace in the Middle East without blood in the sand, without money, money, money that they would spend. A vote for me and the Republican party is a vote for the American dream. Remember the party of Abraham Lincoln, the late great Abraham Lincoln. People forget, but it’s the American dream.(01:08:53)
Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world, and we will end our reliance on China. That’s already begun. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Your Second Amendment.(01:09:26)
We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which is so good. Starts January 1st. Lower drug prices even more. We’re going favored nations. The drug companies are not in love with me. Favored nations. We’ll be paying the lowest drug prices anywhere in the world instead of the highest drug prices of the world. But the big pharma… I don’t even want to look at Chuck and Joni, because I have no idea if they’re… You know, the biggest lobbyists in the world, right? They spend more money. I can tell you, they’re making more commercials about me than sleepy Joe is, but we had to do it. Somebody had to do it. Only a non-politician would do that. And you pay a press, but we have to do the right thing. You’ll see a 50, 60, 70% reduction in drugs.(01:10:25)
And I got the only reduction last year. We got it down a little bit, one percent. It came down. It’s not that I’m bragging about it, but in 52 years… first time in 52 years the drug prices came down. So we’re sort of… I’m semi proud. At least it didn’t go up. I’m semi proud, but you’ll see what happens with what we’re doing with favored nations. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon in the United States. We’ll be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. It’s all done, our space center. NASA is incredible. It was a closed up, boarded up mess when we took over three and a half years ago. Now it’s, again, the envy of the world. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. Right?(01:11:32)
And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and standing up for the great people of Iowa, and Wisconsin. And Wisconsin. We didn’t forget you, because you’re going to vote us in too. We’re going to be there very soon. We love Wisconsin. Wisconsin came through for us four years ago too, and we won’t forget that. To save the America we love. Get every last person you know… Get them to the voting booth in record numbers. Vote, vote, vote.(01:12:18)
Join the red wave. We have a giant red wave that’s formed. It’s formed. It’s formed from Cambridge to Council Bluffs, to Cedar Rapids, to Rock Rapids, from Davenport to Dubuque. We inherit the legacy of American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come.(01:13:14)
Proud citizens like you help build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help… Thank you. Your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.(01:13:43)
We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Iowa and Wisconsin back there, we have made America powerful again. Our military, our beautiful military. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we will make America great again.(01:14:20)
Thank you Iowa. Thank you Wisconsin. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you everybody. I hope it’s cold enough for you. Thank you everybody. Have a good time. Get out and vote."
trump_raw_faye_nc_nov2_clean.txt,"(07:55)
Thank you Fayetteville and North Carolina. Thank you very much. Tomorrow, we are going to win this state and we are going to win four more years in our great White House. With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, support our fantastic military, care for our veterans, protect your second amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that wonderful phrase, “Made in the USA.” Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded. 33.1% just announced last week. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months. It’s a number that we never even thought possible, nobody did. Nobody thought it was possible and we’re going to now even do better than that. It’s going very rapidly.(09:07)
While foreign nations are in a free fall, you see what’s going on with so many nations in Europe, unfortunately. I say that with sadness. We are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago, under Obama and Biden. You got to remember that, you got to remember that kind of thing. They didn’t do a good job. In fact, if they did, I wouldn’t have runned. If they did, I wouldn’t be here right now. They did a bad job. And Obama, he went out yesterday with Biden. They got like 14 people, they didn’t have too many. They didn’t have too good a crowd and we have five of these today. Five. We have some big ones. Thank you. (09:57)
Thank you. Thank you very much. (10:09)
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you and I love you, too, and I appreciate that. We appreciate it. (10:20)
I was thinking coming in because I watch these fake polls, everyone, no matter if we’re up by 10, if we know we’re going to win easily, he’s down by one point, he’s down by one… I just watch this fake stuff and I’m saying to myself, you know, we’ve been under a phony, fake hoax investigation for three years, nothing but bad and really corrupt publicity from these people. And I say- (10:48)
I wonder what the difference would have been had it been legit, had it been legit. And it turned out to be just the opposite. They were the ones who committed the crimes, not us. But I wonder what it would have been. It probably would have been a little bit easier, but you know the good news, we’re going to win anyway. We’re going to shove it. (11:07)
We’re going to win anyway. I wonder what it would’ve been. I wonder what it would’ve been if all of the nonsense wasn’t brought up. (11:24)
Thank you very much. (11:26)
Thank you very much. Looking tremendous in Florida, so of course, they don’t mention that. It’s Florida. We are looking good. We’re really looking good all over in the real polls, not the Fox polls. Those Fox polls… There’s somebody at Fox who doesn’t like me very much, I can tell you. They are the phoniest polls and they were almost as bad four years ago. Actually, they were worse, but you get some of these pollsters, they work magic. And the amazing thing is, they hang onto their jobs. They do horribly. Look at what they did last… I had nine states and I had to win them all and they said I was going to lose all nine. This is four years ago. I was going to lose all night. It’s going to be very short evening for Donald Trump. And the polls said decisively, “I was going to lose all nine.” And that was the day before and I won all nine. No, I won them all. (12:19)
Or I wouldn’t be here right now. No, I won all nine. They said we’re going to lose all nine and it was quite depressing as I turned on the television, let’s see how we did, he won Florida, he won South Carolina. [inaudible 00:12:32]. No, but thank you. (12:36)
And then they said they’re getting rid of the guy, like at Fox, I heard they were getting rid of that pollster and they kept him and they have others they kept. And you wonder what kind of a business that is? You wonder what kind. We have a case where in Wisconsin, we’re one up and I left there a couple of days ago. We had a rally, you wouldn’t believe it. Packed. Just packed. Just like last night, like here, but like last night, this was the section I wanted to come. This is considered a small, beautiful, cute little wonderful section- (13:07)
And they asked me and I said, “I want to be there.” No, and every vote counts. It’s very important. We had something last night in Miami. You would not have believed it. I don’t know who saw it on television. I don’t know, but you look at some of these results in Wisconsin, whether I’m up one or down one it’s right in that thing. I think we’re going to win Wisconsin because we have a lot of people that say, We don’t want to talk to you,” and then they go vote for Trump. The hidden voter or whatever they call them. Somebody said, “They’re the shy voters.” My people are not shy. They’re not shy. (13:45)
But in Wisconsin, so they said, ABC News, which is in my opinion, corrupt, but they’re all corrupt. ABC News, Washington Post, which is basically lobbyists, as far as I’m concerned for Amazon, it’s just a lobbyist. They didn’t say like, he’s two down, three down, four down, a fake poll. They said, “Trump is 17 points down in Wisconsin.” I could lose it. I could win it. I don’t know how I’m not, I did a lot of good things for Wisconsin, but let’s say it’s even and I call up a great pollster, John, and say, “John, let me ask you a question.” I think we’re one up in Wisconsin, but ABC, Washington Post, they did the same thing four years ago, if you remembered that, very close to the election, they said, we’re down 12. And then we won, but we were down 12 and it’s disheartening.(14:41)
It’s called suppression. What it does is it suppresses people. They say, “Well, listen, we love the president, but if he can’t win…” But they did it four years ago and we complained bitterly with a very good lawyer. I had very good lawyers in those days. We complained very bitterly and they changed it right before the election. I think it was one. We’re down one. They took it from 12 to 1 in about 15 seconds. And I realized, I said, “This is a phony business,” but now they come down and it says 17 down in Wisconsin, 17.(15:15)
I called John, John McLaughlin, he’s like the dean, he’s a great guy and he’s been very good with me. He said, “We’re going to win,” four years ago. He said, “We’re going to win easily this one.” He’s probably the biggest and the best. I said, “John, let me ask you a question. ABC, Washington Post came out with a poll. It said I was 17 down. I’m not 17 down. I might be one down or I might be two up, but I’m not 17 down. What’s going on? Why don’t they make it [inaudible 00:15:43] have to live after that? They have to do other events. Why don’t they make it three or four or two or five or something?”(15:51)
He said, “They can’t do that because they want you to lose and if you’re two or three or four, everyone’s going to go vote. They want to make sure that your people don’t vote and when you’re 17 down, people say, ‘I just can’t waste my time. I’m not going to stand on line.'” And I said, “Isn’t that sick?” And he said, “He knows some of the people and they’re very smart. They’re very brilliant. They’re smart people.” He said, “But if they made it five down or four down or six down even, so they make it something that’s so bad, 17 down.” I said, “Isn’t that a shame? I want to tell that story. Do you mind?” He said, “I don’t care. That’s the way it is.” It’s crooked stuff.(16:29)
The Fox polls are horrible. Every time I have a Fox poll, it’s horrible. I like some of the things on Fox, certainly Sean and Laura, and Tucker’s been great lately. (16:43)
And Fox and Friends in the morning is great.(16:45)
[inaudible 00:16:46]. I find Harris to be great, Harris Faulkner to be really good. She has been very good over a period of time. The great Lou Dobbs, he’s been fantastic. Jeanine, how do we Jeanine?(17:03)
Look, we have some great people that support us. [Jesse 00:17:07] has been great. Pete [inaudible 00:17:09] has been great. And I don’t want to mention, you know there are a lot of people. Look, we have a lot, but it’s 90% negative, everything, everything, but so think of that. I said, “17,” and he gave me an answer. I just thought it was so incredible. I said, “I got to tell that answer.” I hope I haven’t bored you, but I thought it was interesting. [inaudible 00:17:28]. (17:30)
I thought it was interesting. To me, it was interesting and I have like five of these to do today, so let’s get going. (17:39)
And I appreciate you being here. We had some monsters last night. We had some little rough weather. It wasn’t like this. In Michigan, we had a slightly cold day with the wind blowing at 40 miles an hour in my face. And you’re lucky you have a President that doesn’t need a teleprompter. Good memory. (18:05)
I would have been in big trouble. There was no way you could hold paper. There was no way you could do, you were just… And my guys set it up where the wind was right smack in my face and I was looking at that flag from the plane and I said, “Oh no, here we go again.” But actually, the flag must be a very high quality silk because it’s not that windy, but yesterday, that was not an easy day. We had some very cold stops. And Biden and Harris, Kamala, Kamala. You want her? (18:42)
You want her as your first woman president? I don’t think so. (18:47)
And the radical left gain power, they will collapse our economy and send our nation into a depression. Biden will raise your taxes $4 trillion, massively increase your regulations, close down your factory, send your jobs overseas. That’s what he’s-(19:03)
… close down your factory, send your jobs overseas. That’s what he’s been doing all his life. Him and his group, destroy the suburbs, dissolve your borders, terminate religious liberty, outlaw private health insurance, 180 million people have great health insurance. Shred your Second Amendment, confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your children with anti-American lies. Biden has vowed to abolish the American oil and natural gas industries and ban fracking. For a year and a half, he said it. Then all of a sudden he goes to Pennsylvania. “No, I never said that.” And the fake news doesn’t do anything about it. Biden’s energy ban will send every state into crushing poverty from North Carolina to Michigan, to Pennsylvania. As long as I’m president, we will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas.(19:57)
And we will remain energy independent. Sleepy Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars, in countries that most of you have never even heard of. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA … and they’re all coming home, don’t worry about it. I said it.(20:27)
He was a cheerleader for NAFTA and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. North Carolina lost 50% of all manufacturing jobs after those Biden betrayals. And now he says, “Oh, I’m going to …” he’s trying to follow my policy. He’s trying to follow my policy. He’s not going to do my policy has been doing this for 47 years plus, and for eight years as vice president, which is only three and a half years ago. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who raked in millions from China while giving them your jobs. He’s a corrupt politician, you see it. Now they say the laptop Schiff, that watermelon head, Schiff. “That laptop was produced by Russia.” Here we go again, Russia. Russia, Russia. Here we go again. Can you imagine what they must think of it? These people are crazy. No, it was produced by where’s Hunter? That’s right, it was produced by [inaudible 00:02:39]. No, Schiff knows. He a psycho in many ways, but he knows, it’s a total con game. I had to put up with it for three years and it affects it. When you see nothing but negative television every night, every night, every night. And then they find totally no collusion after wasting $48 million, 18 people, think of it. And then it’s no collusion, but then you have to run. But you’ve had three years of horrible publicity and they did it. I mean, they did it. They were the criminals. Hillary was a criminal. She deleted her emails. People go to jail for that.(22:26)
These are criminals. These are criminals. And say it any way you want to do it. But we took the brunt, then we caught him spying in my campaign and trying to overthrow a duly elected president of the United States. And that was before I even knew. That was while I was running, I didn’t even know. I’d hear these things, “Sir.” This is before I got elected. Guys would come up to me every once in a while. “Sir. Do you have anything to do with Russia?” I said, “No. Why do you ask?” “Oh, I was just curious.”(23:00)
Because it was like this thing floating around. Then they come up again, “Sir, are you sure you don’t have anything to do with Russia?” I said, “I have nothing to do with Russia. What the hell are you talking?” And you hear it four or five times, then you get into office and they come up with this scheme and this plot, it was a plot to overthrow the government of the United States. And then we have people that just don’t act fast. It’s just unbelievable. We have so much information. We have the whole thing, and Obama was involved and Biden was involved. They were involved, but let’s see what happens. People should move more quickly. In 2016, North Carolina voted to fire this corrupt political establishment. And you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician is because I’m not a politician. If I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than any president has ever fought for his people. Thank you. Thank you.(24:41)
Get out and vote. That’s all I ask, is take a little time and vote. We got to win this state. I think we win this state, we win Pennsylvania, we’re going to win Florida. We win Pennsylvania and you, were going to win the whole thing. We’re going to win the whole thing.(24:58)
And we’ll send them a signal like they’ve never seen before. This has not happened to them. “Big tech is so powerful. You can’t beat big tech.” They’re saying this. And I see it on Twitter. Trending, trending. It’s not trending. They put the most boring thing. Anything bad about me. Number one in the world on trend. Boring stuff. As opposed to affairs, scandals, that they didn’t even put that stuff up. It’s always Trump, two, three, four, or five items. It’s a fix. It’s a fix. This is a smart guy. We have his name. Everybody knows who he is. And I’m not talking about the primary. I’m talking about people that work. They take stuff out of a hat. “Let’s see? This is bad about Trump. Let’s make it worse. Okay, we’ll make it worse.” Number one trend in the whole world. No, that’s not stuff that trends, but these are phony guys. They fix the elections and you know what?(25:57)
They should be subject to campaign violations because they’re an arm of the Democrat National Committee. They work together. They work on messaging together. The Democrats, the fake news media, they’re the worst. IN fact, these are fake people. And if I’ve done one thing, it’s to expose the dishonesty in the media.(26:24)
And not everybody, but a big, vast majority, a vast majority. Not everybody. Look at us, we catch Hunter and Joe cheating. We catch them stealing millions of dollars. They refuse to write a story. Could you imagine if I got three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow’s wife? Could you imagine? Somebody gave me three and a half million bucks? Somebody gave me $20. They impeached me because they made a perfect phone call to the head of Ukraine. I never met the gentlemen. “Congratulations on your win. If you see anything corrupt, please call the attorney general of the United States.” And we have a corruption agreement with them because it’s been a very corrupt country. I actually have an obligation. Now, of course they impeached before they found out, before I decided to release the phone call. Isn’t it lucky that I had that call transcribed?(27:22)
Can you imagine? Now, they couldn’t do it. They didn’t know what to do. Crazy Nancy said, “This isn’t impeachable.” They said, ” You’re right, but let’s go through with it anyway. Maybe we’ll get lucky.” Because she didn’t know about the call. When she read the call, she said, “Ge didn’t do anything wrong. How did you get me into this? You shifty Schiff? How did you do it”(27:49)
Jerry Nadler, I’ve been fighting this guy for 25 years on the West side of Manhattan. Jerry Nadler, he’s a beauty, isn’t he? How did he get me into this? Well, let’s just keep going forward. It’s a disgrace. And I will say this for the Republicans, 197 or 697 to nothing, we won. And in the Senate, 52 and a half to one half, we lost a half a vote, I wonder who that could have been. But sleepy Joe Biden is bought and paid for by China. They gave the son a billion and a half dollars to manage. That means it’s going to make millions of dollars a year, but he does know anything about investment. Didn’t know anything at all about energy. He got $183,000 a month on energy. Think of that. Think of that, $183,000. I called a friend of mine on Wall Street, “Is just a normal fee.”(28:44)
He said, “No, maybe the most abnormal fee I’ve ever seen in my whole life. I’ve been doing this for 25 years.” He’s the biggest guy. But they’re bought and paid for. They got the money and then they were going for the big one in China. They wrote a letter to very big powerful man within the communist party. And where Hunter asked for $10 million a year, as he was going to recommend, he was going to talk. Here’s a guy didn’t have a job, got thrown out of the Navy. He got thrown out of the Navy. He didn’t have a job. Biden becomes vice president. And this kid is like a vacuum cleaner going all over the world, following his father, picking up the scraps.(29:28)
No he’s following his dad, picking up scraps. And then when you find the note where the big man gets 10%, the big man’s Joe Biden. The big man gets 10, then in one case, they said 50%, right? That’s more likely because he wouldn’t do it for 10. Because these people are all hangers on, losers. But that’s the story and it’s in a laptop. And now they say the laptop was made by Russia, therefore it has no credibility. Can you believe this? And so the news, outside of the New York Post, which really I hold in high esteem. They’re a hero paper and they endorsed me.(30:19)
I got a nice endorsement from, did you say from Pennsylvania yesterday, right? Pittsburgh Gazette. That was nice. Once I got through that first paragraph, it was phenomenal, actually. They said, “We don’t love his personality. We don’t love his tough.” I have to be tough. Look, I’ve been under investigation from before I ever became president. I have to be tough. If I were soft, I wouldn’t be here right now. And they don’t want to say that. I was under a fake investigation by a lot of fake people. Bob Mueller and his crew, the whole thing was a fake scam that should have never been started. And they knew the answer to the first day, but it took him two and a half years to put it down, no collusion, but they knew the answer the first day. So I was under investigation for the first two and a half years. Think of that. And then they say, “He’s tough.” But I’ll take it anyway. I’ll take their endorsement anyway. Because once you get over the first paragraph or two, it says all of the things we’ve done, which are incredible, which are incredible.(31:29)
And now we’ll have a chance to do it without the cloud. Because I had a cloud hanging over my head, whether we like it or not. And then they say, “He was tough. He fought too hard. He was somewhat crude. He was very, very nasty. His Twitter.” Now, you know what? If I didn’t have social media, I wouldn’t be here. It was the only way I could defend myself. So it was one of those things. But I just wonder, I was thinking, I asked the people on the way, if we have great people, such loyal, great people. Including a man that comes from an area not too far from here, is a good friend of these women who have been here, this is number 64 time for these incredible, beautiful, I think rich women and their husbands are in here someplace.(32:12)
But they had their husbands. They were at the one last night. That was a big deal, wasn’t it? But this is number 64. I would say I, right? (32:21)
65. Oh, there’s two more. They come from North Carolina, but we have Mark Meadows comes from North Carolina. And he has been fantastic, he’s done a great job. He’s done a great job. Where is he? He’s probably working, bump, bump, bump with a phone. He’s got two phones instead of one. And he’s not going to break it up with a hammer like Hillary did. He’s going to throw it away.(32:51)
He’s done a fantastic job. And he loves this state and he loves North Carolina. And I specifically said, “I want somebody from North Carolina and give me Meadows.” Now I knew three years ago. I said, “We got to get Meadows in here.” Big tech, big media, big donors and powerful special interests are desperate for sleepy Joe to win. They want them to win. I’ll tell you who wants him to win, China. They will own our country because they own him, they control him and they know he will always be there to do their bidding. He’ll always be there. He’s a corrupt politician. I don’t care, I’ll say it. And I say it, everybody knows it’s true. Can you imagine? Big tech refuses to put anything in. They took the New York Post down for two weeks because they won’t let anyone write.(33:42)
If you put out a little tweet and say that Biden is corrupt, they will knock out your whole account. Nobody’s ever seen anything like this and you notice, it is outside of what I say, it is indeed fading away. Because you can’t have a scandal if nobody writes about it. So we have the fake news not writing about it. And you have the big tech not writing. So, how can you have a scandal? Nobody’s allowed to talk. It’s called suppression. We don’t have freedom of the press. We probably haven’t had it for a long time, but we don’t have … they say, “Freedom of the press. The American way.” We have suppression by the press. That’s what it is. What beautiful words I should have done the speech this way, it would have been much more interesting.(34:32)
No, but seriously, we have suppression by the press. This is not freedom. It really is, it’s the exact opposite of freedom of the press if you think about it. Every corrupt force in American life that is responsible for cruel betrayals that hurt our family and all of the people that we love, they’re supported by Biden and they donate to Biden. I could have been a much bigger fundraiser than him, but I didn’t want to call every head of a Wall Street firm, every head of the oil companies that we’ve made rich anyway. I did a great job, we’re energy independent, that’s not so bad, first time.(35:12)
The failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars, they support sleepy Joe Biden, because they get anything they want. And he took in $300 million last month. You think he made any deals? No, I don’t think so. The career politicians that offshored your industries and decimated your factories, they support sleepy Joe. The open borders lobbyists that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs, gangs and crimes. The people that wanted to stop the wall, even though it knew it works. It’s almost finished by the way, be finished very soon.(35:51)
But the people that wanted to stop it, even though they knew full well, it worked. Remember they said, “No, no, we don’t want a wall. Walls are obsolete. We want drones.” Okay, good. Drones flying to watch the people pour into our country. They want drones, let’s have drones. The far left Democrats that ruined our public schools, depleted our inner cities, defunded our police and demeaned your sacred faith and values. They support sleepy, Joe Biden. You can’t even go to your churches. You can’t even go to your church and your governor of North Carolina, you got to open up your state.(36:36)
You got to get your governor, I hope you’re going to vote for Dan who’s good. You got to get your state open. Don’t worry about it, on November 4th they’ll announced your state is opening. November 4th, north Carolina will be opened on November 4th. Right after the election. Because they want us to look bad. They don’t care about people. They want us to look bad. They want to try and steal an election.(37:07)
The anti-American radicals defaming our noble history, our heritage, our heroes, they support sleepy Joe. Antifa and the rioters and looters and Marxists and left wing extremists, they all support Joe Biden. They always like to blame it on the right. Do you ever notice? “These were right wing.” It’s very rare. It’s rare. It’s you got bad on every side, but they always like to blame the right. It always starts off with the right, the right. This election comes down to a simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the arrogant, corrupt, ruthless, and selfless political class? Or do you want to be governed by the American people themselves? You want to be represented by a career politician who hates you, or by an outsider who will defend-(38:03)
Who hates you or by an outsider who will defend you like you have never been defended before. I didn’t need this job. I had a very nice life, but I love what we’re doing for our country. Nobody’s done so much. Nobody, no administration and I never even had a challenge on this from the fake news. Normally, if you say something slightly off, they make a big deal. No administration, president has done more in the first three and a half years then we have, our military we rebuilt, our tax cut, our regulation cuts, Space Force. It’s just a thing like Space Force. I never even talked about Space Force during the campaign. I did more than I actually talked about during the campaign. Thank you. Thank you very much. I thought this was a small little cute area. This is a small little cute area. When I came in, I’m watching Fox and a gentlemen and anchor said, “They have a small crowd of about 2000, 2,500. Nah, I knew. I knew.” It’s an incredible thing. This is a lot more than that. This is a lot of people. This is a lot more than I wanted to do because [inaudible 00:39:51]. I mean, my granddaughter is named Carolina. Do you know that? And we’ll give South Carolina some credit too. They’ve been waiting. Is that okay? I want to get your permission. South Carolina is great. They are great people too. A vote for Biden is a vote to hand the keys to government over to people who despise you and who want to rob your children of their American dream. That’s what they’re doing. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalist, communist, socialist, the wealthy liberal hypocrites who want to silent, censor, cancel and punish you. If you want your children to be safe and remember this, against… I’ll put it very simply, against the second amendment.(40:46)
If you’re pro-life, you can forget about it. Tremendous support. Do you see these people in California? They have lines of hundreds of miles of cars and tractors in Iowa and boats, five or 6,000 boat in lakes and ocean with the flags. If you want your values to be respected, if you want to be treated with honor and dignity and respect, then I am asking for you to go out tomorrow or sooner, but I don’t know. You tend to like to vote on Election Day, right? We all do and vote. This is going to be the most important election in my opinion in the history of our country. I never thought I was going to say it. If you have told me, I was going to say that four years ago, I would’ve said you’re crazy, but it’s the most important because I’ve always said we will never be a socialist nation and that’s what they’re trying [inaudible 00:41:47].(41:54)
And remember what I said. Four years ago I said, “I am your voice and we will make America great again,” and that’s what we’re doing. And if we didn’t get hit by the China plague, now we’re building it up again and we’re doing it at record clip and record numbers and at a much faster pace than any other country in the world, but we got hit by the plague from China and we will never forget it. With God is my witness, I will never let you down. For the last four years, the depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me because they know I don’t answer to them, I answer to you. Together we will defeat the corrupt establishment, we will dethrone the failed political class and we will drain the Washington swamp and we will save the American dream. This election is also a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown. He wants to have you locked down.(43:04)
I don’t even know if he knows to be honest. They ask him a question. I don’t think he has a clue. You can vote whoever you want, but I don’t think he has a clue. You know it, the media knows it. The media laughs behind his back and then they say, “He did brilliantly today.” No, he didn’t do brilliantly. He didn’t do brilliantly in his prime, and he’s not in his prime anymore. Or a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic and we’re doing very well with the vaccines. They’ll be distributed very soon. We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks. It will quickly eradicate the virus and wipe out the China plague once and for all. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state. Looking again, that’s more Kamala. Remember when they said this is the Harris-Biden administration, right? I never did that with Mike. And you know what? Mike Pence never came to me and said, “Do you mind if I put my name first every once and a while?” Well, no. And by the way, he’s been a great Vice President.(44:17)
Some people say it was a perfect combination. It was. He’s a great guy. He’s going to be in your state in a little while. Locking you in your home while letting far left writers roam free. The Biden lockdown will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Easter, no Christmas, no 4th of July and no future for America’s youth. Other than that, it’s fine. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family and freedom to live your life, that you go and cast your ballot for President Trump. And if you remember the catastrophe. Joe Biden, he’s telling us how to run things right? This guy never ran a thing successfully. He always said horrible things about him when he was in the… Obama didn’t even want to endorse him. He wouldn’t endorse him. Even after he won, Obama said, “No way.” How long did it take him after he won? It took forever. Obama couldn’t believe it. I don’t think Obama is much better. You want to know the truth. Joe Biden personally ran the swine flu, right? The swine flu, H1N1, which he can never remember. He never says it. He says it and then goes N1H1 and I said, “No.” He failed horribly and he was a laughing stock all over Washington. They were laughing at him. And his own Chief of Staff said he was absolutely terrible.(45:52)
They did a terrible job. Now he’s telling us how to do it. I should have closed earlier. There’s only one problem. He’s on record all over the place, knocking me two and a half months later for closing too soon and closing it all. He said, “Don’t close.” He’s xenophobic. He’s xenophobic. I didn’t like people from China is what he’s saying. It’s so wrong. I think they’re incredible people. I do. I think they’re incredible people, but he said xenophobic. And then he runs for office. He said, “He should have closed earlier.” And you know what? The press never covers that. The only time I get it covered is if I happen to be on live television. I’ll say it again and again. And when I do say it, they try and turn it off, “Let’s go to commercial break right now. I think I know what’s coming.” These are really bad people. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said that Biden has been wrong actually on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. He had no respect for him whatsoever.(46:57)
I’m sure he endorsed him because he’s probably looking for something like everybody else, but I don’t think any of them are going to get anything because I think we’re going to have one of the greatest victories tomorrow, but you don’t have to take my word for what a disaster Joe Biden is because it’s the great state of North Carolina. I spent a fortune. See this? See the board? I spent a lot of money on the board. So let’s just take a look at a little roll. Let’s roll it please. (50:33)
Don’t do it. Don’t don’t do it to yourselves. Our country has such potential. You can’t do that to our country. He’s not mentally equipped. He just isn’t to be your president. He’s not equipped to be your president. And I say it because he’s not a nice person, never was a nice person, but he was never a smart person. He was a touchy feely person, hale and hearty, but not nice. But this is not a man that 25 years ago is not equipped to be your president. And he ran many times, numerous times. We called him 1% Joe. Think of it. And now he’s working on about 50% and he ends up winning the nomination because of Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren gave him the numb. All she had to do is drop out and he would have lost on… I mean, then we would have had crazy Bernie. But at least Bernie, they had a great energetic base. It’s a small base, but energetic, but this is not a man that should be your president. We have tremendous potential.(51:50)
Our country has tremendous potential and we can’t blow it. We can’t blow it because there’s no way to describe that. And that’s like 1% .we could keep you out here all day. Much of it happened yesterday and the day before yesterday, oh, he had some beauties yesterday, but we can’t do this. And you know what’s going to happen? Kamala will be put in that position very quickly. And she’s more liberal than crazy Bernie. She’s more liberal. In fact, she makes him look like a strict conservative. Joining us today are some incredible people, incredible friends and warriors. And I want to tell you, I just looked at a poll and he’s up in the poll, Senator Thom Tillis. He’s up.(52:42)
That’s great. I’m good. I’m very happy with that. We got to get him and he’s a good man, a good man. And your wife was great the other night. We had a great rally the other night and you are well-represented, let me tell you, very well. Congratulations. Well, let’s save that for tomorrow or the next day, or as the Supreme Court would say, “Sometime into the future.” What a ruling. What a ruling. What a horrible thing that they’ve done. Do you know that puts our country in danger? Do you know what can happen during that long period of time Pennsylvania? The long period of time, do you know what can happen? Number one, cheating can happen like you’ve never seen. This is their dream and they are known for it. The Philadelphia area is known for it, but what can happen during that long period of time is just a disgrace. Get the ballots in and have them in long before the third and have them counted before the third and have an election where we can say to the world that we know who won and we know who lost. I’m just so tired of some of these horrible political decisions that are being made. It’s a shame. It’s a shame. And I won’t get into it too much, but I’m going to start getting into it because they’re hurting our country very badly.(54:22)
Representative warrior, David Rouzer. David, thank you. You’re doing a great job. Appreciate it. Congress, we have a friend over there. Richard Hudson. Where’s Richard? Richard Hudson, Congressman, and another great guy. Great guys. Did a fantastic job and a friend of mine and somebody that’s done an incredible job also in Congress, Dan Bishop. Thanks Dan. How you’ve been? You’re doing a good job. He came in through the system. He won a race. It was a tough race, right? We worked together on it and he had no choking him. He started off a little behind to put it nicely and he ended up winning and he one solid and how are you doing on this one? Good? I don’t have to help you as much. He’s going to win. He’s going to win. He should win. He’s a great Congressman. All of them, all three. Thank you very much fellas. A man that hopefully you’re going to recognize for, I guess he doesn’t have the funds that the other one has. I see commercials all the time for your governor that has you in a total lockdown, but Dan Forest would be a phenomenal governor, a phenomenal governor. He did have a surprise there. That could be a big, beautiful gift to North Carolina. A gift. That’s not bad. Hey Dan, that’s not bad huh? Beautiful. Dan, that’s a very impressive applause you got. I have to be honest.(56:12)
Don’t kid yourself. That is like a poll. It’s like a poll, except instead of interviewing 73 people, they have thousands of people here. Much more than the 2000. He’s got a nice 2000 people and I don’t think so. Well, last night in Miami, you want to see a crowd, you couldn’t even see the end of it. I’ve never seen anything like it. There’s such spirit. I’ve never seen spirit like this. At North Carolina GOP chair, somebody doing an incredible job if we win tomorrow. By the way, if we don’t win tomorrow, they’ll say, “How’s Michael Watley doing?” I say, “Not good at all. He didn’t do a good job.” Michael Watley, are we doing okay, Michael? Yes? Get out. Get out to vote Mike. Get them out.(57:03)
Get out. Get out to vote, Mike, get them out. Get out to vote. Thanks, Michael and you are doing a good job. I also want to recognize Medal of Honor recipient, Command Sergeant Major Bob Patterson. Where’s Bob? Where’s Bob? Where is Bob? Whoa! He looks good. He looks good. Wow. Your husband. Whoa. That’s a good looking couple. (57:37)
Wow. That’s some incredible honor. That’s some incredible honor, I’ll tell you what. There’s no greater honor. And are you proud of your husband? But he’s proud of you too. Oh, she’s proud of Trump, look at that. Thank you. I knew I liked her. I knew I liked her. Thank you both very much. Great honor. That’s the highest honor you can get.(58:08)
Former prisoner of war and Vietnam veteran, Captain Ken Wells, a real hero. Where is Ken? A real hero. Thank you. Thank you. (58:32)
Real tough one. Look at him, he’s tough. He’s a tough looking guy. Thank you. Thank you very much. Beautiful. You look great. Thank you. These are great people.(58:42)
And World War II hero and D-Day veteran, very, very brave, they say, Harold Frank. Hi, Harold. You’re looking good. Thank you, Harold. Thank you, Harold. Thank you. They said he’s a brave one. Thank you, Harold, you’re looking good. These guys look good. I don’t know. They go through all that, they come out, they look better than all of us. I don’t know. Something about the war, something about brave people, right? Military spouse, and don’t ever underestimate that is where it all begins. Somebody who’s incredible. Donna Dotson. Donna. Where’s Donna? Thank you, Donna thank you very much. Thank you, Donna. Great to have you. Thank you very much. And retired Sergeant Major Karen De la Vega. Karen, thank you. Thank you, Karen. Great people. Thank you all for your extraordinary service and it’s an honor to have you with us, really is, thank you very much.(59:59)
For 47 years, Joe Biden, viciously, repeatedly attacked black Americans. He decimated the black middle-class and called young black men super predators. To every black American vote for Trump. This is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to insult you, to jail you and to betray you. I am fighting for you and got criminal justice reform, prison reform, Opportunity Zones with Tim Scott and funding for historically black colleges and universities. I got it done. Nobody else got it done.(01:00:50)
And with the exception of, and I use the word possibly, possible exception, but I could use it and maybe I won’t, I’ll keep it a little bit less controversial, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, there has been no president that’s done more for the black community than Donald Trump. Nobody. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.(01:01:24)
Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history. Joe Biden has pledged to open borders. He’s actually talking about taking down the wall. Can you believe? “Let’s take down the wall and let everybody pour into our country.” He wants to take down. I know he said it. I don’t know. Maybe, but he did say let’s take down the wall. One of the biggest projects that we’ve ever done, you know, it’s a tremendous project. We’re up to over 400 miles. We’re going to be finished very soon. Over 400 miles. Designed to the specifications of the Border Patrol, who are great.(01:02:03)
Mass Amnesty wants to give them free healthcare. This is for illegal aliens and wants to keep deadly sanctuary cities. Your state has a sanctuary city. You know that, right? You have a sanctuary city, right? A very big one, actually, that doesn’t work very well. We believe our city should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not criminals aliens. The Biden-Harris plan would increase refugees from terrorist nations by a staggering 700%. This has been a great term. This has been a great term. No thank you, fellas. I’m not interested. I’m keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. If I have the approval of North Carolina, I will keep them out. We’re going to keep them out. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. We have the greatest equipment, greatest people. 2.5 trillion. You think that was easy to get from the Democrats? Actually the wall was even tougher. The wall was tougher but we got. Do you notice once I got the wall started and got all the funding, won all the court cases against the Democrats, the press never talks about it anymore. They don’t talk about it. We had the best statistics, the best…(01:03:31)
And can you imagine during the pandemic, because Mexico’s very heavily unfortunately infected and it was a good thing that we had it up that’s why the numbers are so good. We also passed for our great vets, VA Choice and VA Accountability. Nobody thought that could happen. We obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. We killed the leader of ISIS, al- Baghdadi is dead. Last week, I visited Fort Bragg where I presented the Presidential Unit Citation to the special forces team that achieved that historic victory. It was good. And we are keeping the name Fort Bragg, you do know that, right? Do you agree. They want cancel culture. We won two world wars out of Fort Bragg and we have other forts and we’re keeping it. We won two world wars out of Fort Bragg. And now they say, “Let’s change the name. Let’s change the name of Fort Bragg. We’ll pick somebody else. Do you have any good suggestions?” No, no. We have to keep. We have to keep. It’s our culture. It’s our heritage. So many victories, so many victories out of Fort Bragg. We also eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani is dead. I recognize the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years they tried to get it. And instead of endless war in the Middle East we’re forging peace. They are lined up to come in.(01:05:35)
I said, “How did Obama and all of those that came before him do?” They told me they all used the same method. I said, “Really, I’m going to go the opposite method.” And it worked very nicely. No blood in the sand, no cost. Three very powerful countries already signed. We have many others. They’re standing on line, standing on line. And we’re bringing our troops back home. Our troops are coming back home. They’re coming back home. 19 years is enough. They serve as policemen. I said, “No, you have to get your own police department, I’m sorry.”(01:06:20)
A vote for me and the Republican party is a vote for the American dream. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China, which has already started. Can you imagine Biden saying we’re not going to our reliance? I mean, can you imagine? “We are going to end our reliance on you.” “Hey, hey we gave your son a billion and a half. What the hell are you telling me?” Okay, well, I don’t know, Senator, I think it would be tough for him, right? They wanted 10 million a year for his services, right? And then you say, “No, I’m not going to deal with China anymore.” Or “I’m going to be tough on China.”(01:07:11)
I’ve taken out many, many billions of dollars. We never did this in this country, not 25 cents. I just gave $28 billion from China to our farmers because they targeted our farmers. 28 billion and we had plenty of money left over, which went into the US Treasury. Thank you. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults for law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty and free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength.(01:08:09)
We’re the envy of every country in the world. Our military now has the greatest equipment all made in the USA, but we have the greatest equipment in the world. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency and lower drug prices even more. We instituted a favored nation’s laws. We pay by far the most in the world. We are going to pay now the least in the world and nobody can believe I did it. And big pharma does not like me too much. They are not so happy with me. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman in the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools.(01:09:08)
We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina. I do.(01:09:48)
And your tobacco growers are in good shape, by the way, please let them know, okay. Do you have any tobacco growers, please? They’re in good shape. They work hard. They were treated very rough. Tomorrow, you have the power to do so much for our country. You have the power to vote. So go out and vote. Unless you’re going to vote for somebody other than me, in which case, [inaudible 01:10:12]. Do you ever hear these politicians get up and they say, “You have the power to vote and it makes no difference if you vote for me or my opponent,” they’re such liars. Liars. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get your boss, grab him by the tie, say, “Let’s go boss.” And get out and vote.(01:10:39)
From Greensboro to Charlotte, from Wilmington to Raleigh, from Asheville to right here in Fayetteville. Fayetteville. I love the name, Fayetteville. We inherit the legacy of American Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great, great, beautiful skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come. You will see that.(01:11:34)
Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God and together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we have made America powerful again, military. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you. Go out and vote."
trump_raw_hickory_nc_clean.txt,"(02:08)
Thank you very much. Wow. This is a very big crowd. Wow look at this. Hello North Carolina, hello. Two days from now we are going to win this great State just like we did last time. You were the one, right? You were the one that put us over that hump and we’re going to win four more years in the white house, our beautiful white house. With your vote we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, protect our Second Amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. Under my leadership our economy grew at the fastest rate ever recorded, 33.1% just announced. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months while foreign nations are in a free fall, we’re creating the world’s greatest economic powerhouse. A recent Gallup Poll just came out, found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under Obama and sleepy Joe Biden.(03:53)
And I want to tell you it’s really windy up here. Thank goodness you have a President that doesn’t need teleprompters because these things are virtually useless. They are blowing all over the place. That’s true. They’re blowing all over. We started off today two great places. We went to Iowa, I’ll tell you what, in Iowa we had the coldest windiest, but it was warm because the people were warm and we’re going to win Iowa, very big, very big. But we had a couple of cold stops today. One was so cold we talked about refugees, we said, if they come in they’re going to say, “I want to go back immediately,” it was so cold. If Biden and Harris get in, the economy will collapse and our country will go into at least a free fall, but probably a depression, they want to raise your taxes. They want to take away your Second Amendment, they want to do lots of things that I don’t think you can stand for.(05:02)
I don’t think you can send for, fracking doesn’t pertain so much to it, it does pertain in a different way to you than it would to Pennsylvania. They’re taking away you’re fracking but what they’re really doing is your energy costs are going to go through the roof, that will be very bad for this incredible State. They want to massively increase regulations, send your jobs overseas, destroy the suburbs, well we’re keeping the suburbs. I got rid of the regulation that would have destroyed the suburbs, they will bring it back worse than ever before. Terminate religious liberty, eliminate school choice, outlaw private healthcare, and shred your Second Amendment, take away your guns and indoctrinate your children with anti-American lies. Biden has vowed to abolish U.S. oil, U.S. fracking, natural gas, industry. Look at what he’s talking about doing, but it’s not him, he’s shot, okay? It’s not him.(06:09)
It’s the radical left, it’s the radical left. Energy prices will explode and that will cripple our country. We, right now, are energy independent, what we have going we’ve never had before. Biden’s energy ban will send every state from North Carolina to Michigan to Pennsylvania into a very, very severe problem and we’re not going to have it, we worked too hard. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country and then the plague came in from China, it came in from China, they should have never allowed it. They stopped it from going into China, but it came to us and Europe and the rest of the world and we’re never going to ever forget, we will never forget. But now we’re building our economy back up and it’s going in a V, but it’s really a super V. As long as I’m President, we will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on the planet earth and we will remain energy independent. Our opponents’ agenda is a war on workers, a war on faith and a war on our great police. Biden says he’s running as a proud Democrat, I’m running as a proud American.A! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!(07:48)
Thank you. Thank you very much. By the way, I just have to say this. So we had something incredible happen four years ago. This is more important and there’s more energy, the crowds are bigger, everything’s hotter. But this is actually and I never thought I’d say it because that was an incredible period of time, never thought, this is the most important election perhaps in the history of my country. Get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. Sleepy Joe Biden is a diehard globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in ridiculous, endless wars and they’re all coming back, they’re all coming back. North Carolina lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs thanks to NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever. And we got rid of it, nobody thought that was possible. Promises made, promises kept. We did it all. Biden and his group shipped your jobs and your factories to China and other places in far away lands raking in millions of dollars for himself it turns out, we didn’t know about this, did we? His son was like a human vacuum cleaner, he went in and “Where are you going today, dad?” “I think I’ll go to Ukraine.” “Okay, let me pick up a couple of bucks.” $183,000 a month and $3 million upfront. “Where are you going today dad?” “I’m going to go to Russia,” “Good.” So the Mayor of Moscow’s wife gave him three and a half million dollars, right? And here’s the scary part, the fake news media and there’s a lot of it right back there, the fake news, they don’t want to talk about it, they don’t want to talk about it. And big tech will refuse to put it on and then they’ll terminate the New York Post if they put it up, New York Post I have to give them a lot of credit. Number one, they endorse me, which is nice.(10:06)
I got endorsed today by the Pittsburgh Gazette and it hasn’t happened where they endorsed a Republican today. Nobody can believe it, they haven’t done it in decades. And thank you very much Pittsburgh Gazette, we’ll take it. We got endorsed by a lot of great people, we got endorsed by great people and a lot of newspapers are endorsing us because they know that Joe Biden is not up to this job. All you have to do is watch him for about five minutes, he is not up to this job. One thing I can tell you, President Xi, Putin, Kim Jong-un, they’re very sharp, they’re very sharp, they’re all very sharp and we cannot have a leader that’s not sharp. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who is bought and paid for by China and other countries.(10:57)
How can you have a guy whose son walks out with a billion and a half dollars to manage, that means millions of dollars a year, whose son asked for $10 million a year for introductory purposes, right? $10 million a year and he’s supposed to be negotiating with China? China would just hope that I don’t win because, hey, we’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars a year first time ever with China, we never took in $25 cents. Saved our steel mills, saved our steel mills, saved our steel and aluminum industries. In 2016, North Carolina voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected a President who is finally putting America first. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician it’s because thankfully I’m not a politician and never will be. And if I don’t always play by …(12:03)
Never will be. And if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because I fight for you and there’s never been anybody that’s fought harder for you. I had a very nice life before doing this. I had a very nice life. (12:33)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. So nice of you. That’s such a great honor, when I hear that. It’s never been said at any… I said, “Did anybody ever hear that? Ronald Reagan we liked, others we like.” Nobody’s ever heard it, and I appreciate it very much. My opponent is promising a long dark winter. Did anybody see the debate? I’m sure nobody watched it, right? He didn’t do too well. Remember he said, “You’re going to have a long dark winter”? It’s so inspiring. How about somebody says, “Gee, we really like Biden”? I don’t think anybody likes Biden. “Harry, let’s watch Biden tonight on television.” And he says, “We’re going to have a long dark winter.” How inspiring that is, right? So he said that, and I’m saying that we’re going to deliver the greatest American comeback in history. That’s what we’re doing, and we’re way ahead of schedule.(13:32)
This election is a choice between a Biden depression and a boom like you’ve never seen before. It’s a choice between a Biden lockdown. He wants to lock you down. Let’s lock it down. Let’s lock it down. And by the way, tell your Governor to open up North Carolina. It’s time. It’s ridiculous. It’s ridiculous. They’ll probably announce it on November 4th. “We’re going to open up now.” They thought our numbers wouldn’t be so good. They thought by keeping these states like Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan, how about her? Her husband roams free. He’s the only one in the whole state. No, but they thought that by keeping them down the numbers would … And yet we had, at 33.1, that’s the highest in the history of our country. By double. You have to go back to 1952, and that was half of what we did. So we are looking forward. We’re going to have very shortly, within a couple of weeks, we’re going to have a safe vaccine that will end.(14:42)
And now look, we’re rounding, they hate when I say it, the fake news, but we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner anyway. We’re rounding the corner. But on top of that, we have vaccines coming from Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, great companies, and they’re right there, they’re right. And we’re going to have them launched. And our military is going to do it logistically. Incredible. And we’re going to start with our seniors, especially our seniors where they have some problems with heart, with diabetes, and we’re going to have a great thing. It’s going to speed up the process we launched. And by the way, it does work here. I am. Here I am. No, I like to say that the medicine I took, Regeneron, I’d like to say that it had no impact on me, because I’m a perfect physical specimen and I’ very young. But I decided to take it anyway.(15:40)
No, it’s amazing the things we’ve been able to do in the last six months. Not only that, if you look at all of what we produce now, we’ve become a production … Incredible what we’re doing and what we’re sending to the world. The ventilators, what we’re sending to the world, I mean, we’re sending things that nobody could believe. The treatments that reduce the fatality rate now 85%. Think of it, think of it. But my wife, our First Lady got it and our son Baron got it. And Barron’s 14, and he’s very tall and he’s strong. And he had it for a matter of minutes. That’s why I say, “Get the kids back to school. Get them back to school.” The doctor came up to us and said, “I’m sorry, but Barron has tested positive.” And I said, “For what? Tested positive for what? And it’s got about 30 different names, but he said, “COVID.”(16:41)
We could call it the China Plague, the China Virus, but he didn’t say. He said, “COVID. I said, “Gee, that’s too bad.” He said, “Oh, he’ll be fine.” About 14 minutes later, he came back. I said, “How’s Baron doing?” “Oh, he shook it off. It’s fine. He’s fine.” They’re young. They have strong immune systems. Get them back to school, please. We’ve learned about this horrible plague that was sent to us by China. Our excess mortality rate in America is 40% lower than Europe. You keep hearing Europe is doing so well. They’re not doing so well. And we want them to do well, by the way. And we helped them. We helped them. We want them to do well. But they’re having a very hard time.(17:27)
Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state while letting rioters roam fee. They close your churches, they close your schools, but if you want to riot and burn down the stores and have the anarchists out there and do lots of it, that’s okay. You can’t stop that. You can’t go to school and you can’t go to church. It’s crazy. All Democrat run, by the way. All Democrat run. You look at Portland, Democrat, super liberal Democrat. We could fix that situation. We have to be invited in. We fixed Seattle because we said, “That’s enough. We’re going in. We don’t care. We’re going in.” So we were going in the next morning. That night they found out about it. They said, “We’re leaving now. Thank you very much.” And we did a great job in Minnesota, Minneapolis. After you watched that place burning, down a week and a half later, they went in and solved it in about a half an hour.(18:29)
If we’d listened to Joe Biden on allowing travel to come in from China and Europe, remember he said, “Oh, he’s xenophobic.” Now, he runs for President, he said, “We should have acted sooner.” Months later, he didn’t think we should do it. Hundreds of thousands more people would have died. We saved two million people or more. Remember the model? It said 2.2 million people would die. Well, we saved two million people by acting quickly. Now, Biden wants a cruel and very heartless nationwide shut down. It won’t affect you, because you’re already shut down. I don’t know what the heck. What’s going on with your state? Are you ready to open up? I think so, huh? No, you know what? People aren’t going to take it anymore. Look at what happened in Europe, and the people are revolting. They don’t want to do it anymore. They can’t do it anymore. We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem itself. That was the first thing I said a long time ago.(19:34)
The Biden lockdown will result in countless deaths and wipe out an entire generation of dreams. And we’ve learned that children with a computer do not do well compared to being in classes. They don’t do well. It’s not the same. And the parents have to go to work, and the problems that are caused with alcohol, drug abuse. We can’t let this happen. And you can’t let it go on. I have a feeling that probably they’ll say, “It’s now November 4th, the day after the election, we’ll go back. We’ll go back.” He should have never done that. And they should have never done that. And actually, the states that are doing best, look at Florida, look at all of these states where they had a spike and they didn’t close down. Look at what happened in Arizona. Look at what happened in Texas. We can’t let it happen. Europe imposed Draconian lockdowns, and yet their cases are exploding. Their deaths are surging and their economies are, let’s face it, you look at what happened, they’re in ruins.(20:37)
We had the smallest down and the largest up and the largest fast up on the economy, by far. So the European lockdowns are leading to more suffering, delayed medical care, and financial devastation. A vote for Biden is a vote for lockdowns, layoffs, misery, and getting rid of your Second Amendment. They want to hurt our police, but they want to take away your guns. Very interesting, isn’t it? If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life, then go cast your ballot, cast your vote for me. We’re going to do it. We’re doing it. But you don’t have to take my word for it, because in certain states that I like a lot, we spend a lot of money for, where is that rail? Look at that over there. Look at that. (21:35)
You’re going to see something right now. You don’t have to listen. Please roll the video. Roll it.lem is I voted for NAFTA. I’m supporting NAFTA because I think it is a positive thing to do. And I do not pretend to be an expert on international trade matters.ade agreements like NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China, which forced American workers to compete against people making pennies an hour has resulted in the loss of 160,000 jobs. (26:25)
Thank you. Well, thank you very much. That saves a lot of words up here on this cold windy night. It saves a lot of words, but we can’t do this to our country. We have such potential. We cannot do this. He’s failed for 47 years. And at the debate, all I had to do is very easy. I said, “Joe, why didn’t you do it?” You know, as he stood in complained, “What about this, what…,” I said, “Joe, you left three and a half years ago. You were there for a long time. And you were in that position for eight years. Why didn’t you do it, Joe?” And he never had an answer. No law enforcement endorsements, no nothing.(27:20)
Joining us tonight are some people that have done a great job and people that really helped me a lot in Washington, a man who right now I hear you do doing extremely well in the polls, senator, Tom Tillis. Tom, very good. I just saw a very good poll and we had a very good poll today, too.(27:44)
I have to tell you that. I’ll tell you what, if I don’t win after coming here… They said, “Maybe we can cancel North Carolina tonight.” One of my guys, one of my geniuses said, “I think they’d understand.” You’ve only been out here for two days waiting. I said, “I don’t have the courage to even think about asking that question.” No, would never even think about it. No, you’ve been great to me. The victories that we’ve had together and what we’ve done for you, and we have you protected, including your tobacco growers. Right? We have it all. We have you all protected. You’re all protected.(28:22)
A really wonderful person, wonderful woman, and she’s always with me, representative Virginia, Foxx. Virginia., thank you. Thank you, Virginia. Great job. You do.(28:34)
A man that I’d love to see in. He’ll open you up. I think we can get a guarantee tonight. Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest. Come on Dan, win. Good, Dan. Boy oh boy, I tell you that would be a natural. That’s a natural. You’ll open it up right away. Okay. You should win just on that one. This is crazy. He’s doing what the Washington Democrats are telling him to do.(29:05)
Attorney General candidate Jim O’Neill, hi, Jim. I Great job, Jim. GOP Chairman Mike Whatley. How are we doing, Mike? Are we winning? Are we leading? The poll’s up. Right? Yeah, we’re up pretty good. We should be up.(29:24)
Can you imagine? Can you imagine pastor and a friend of mine and he lives right down the road, Pastor Franklin Graham.hank you, Mr. President. And I would like to just take a second to pray for this man. Will you join me? Father and our God, we pray for our President. Protect him and his family and protect our nation. And we pray this in Jesus’ name. Amen.(30:16)
You take care of yourself. Thank you. It’s a great honor. That’s good genes right there. Right? That’s good genes, Billy Graham. How good was Billy Graham? Right? Nobody liked Billy.(30:36)
After years of rebuilding foreign countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. For 47 years, the Democrats viciously and brutally repeatedly attacked. And you know what we’re talking about because it was led by a man named Joe Biden… Black Americans, they attacked. Decimated the black middle class and called young black men super predators. To every black American, I am asking for you to vote. You have to vote on Tuesday. You can send a message on Tuesday to the corrupt Democrat establishment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.(31:25)
We’ve had tremendous support and by the way, just so you understand, I don’t want to look at all those cameras. Oh, they’re all blazing. You ready? So we’re doing so well. And one of the great things that’s happened is our African American vote. Our black community vote is way up. And they’re all saying, “Wow, wow.” They’re all saying… Everybody back there is saying, “Wow, that’s amazing.” That’s what’s happening in Florida. That’s what’s happening here. That’s what’s happening all over.(31:58)
This is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decisions to attack, insult, jail you. 1994, Bill, I’m fighting for you. And if you look at what we’ve done just quickly, criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunities zones with Tim Scott, historically black colleges and universities long-term funding. They had no funding. They had… Every year, they had to come back and ask for funding. I said, “Nope, we’ve got to get your long-term funding.” We got them more money than they wanted. They needed it.(32:37)
Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure United States border in the history of our country. Biden would make every city in America a sanctuary city, which is not good. And it’s not Biden. It’s not Biden. It’s his handlers. I believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding American citizens. The Biden/Harris plan would also increase refugees 700%, opening flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. You see what’s happening in France. I’m keeping terrorists, jihadists, and violent extremists out of our country.(33:26)
And I was asked, on this very windy night, speaking of that, to do a thing that we used to do during the campaign. I’ll do it. Has anyone heard of The Snake?” Have you heard? Should I do it?(33:42)
So this has to do with this subject. And it’s been a long time since I’ve done this one, but so many people are asking. You ready? The Snake. On her way to work one morning down the path, along the Lake, a tender hearted woman, saw a poor half frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. “Poor thing,” she cried. “I’ll take you in and I’ll take care of you.” “Take me in oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in oh, tender woman,” sighed that vicious snake.(34:24)
She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk. And she laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. She hurried home from work that night. As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she’d taken in had been revived. “Take me in oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in oh, tender woman,” sighed that vicious snake.(34:53)
She clutched him to her bosom. “You’re so beautiful, she cried, ” But I hadn’t brought you in by now, you know, you would have died.” She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying, thank you, this snake gave her a vicious bite. “Take me in oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,” sighed that vicious snake. “I saved you,” cried the woman, “And you bit me, but why? You knew your bite was poisonous and now I’m going to die.” “Shut up, silly woman,” said the reptile with a grin. “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.”(35:47)
So, I’ve been asked by so many people. I’ve been asked to do that one by so many people, but that pertains a little bit to what we see going on. And you look at Paris and you look at the attacks over the last week and you…(36:03)
… Paris and you look at the attacks over the last week and you look at what’s happening and we are doing very well. We are doing very well. We have a very strong policy. We put in a ban that a lot of people were upset about and now they’re saying, thank you very much for the ban. We appreciate it very much.(36:20)
We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. We also passed VA Choice and VA Accountability for our great vets. We have a 91% approval rating with our vets. That’s the highest by a lot in history, that by direction, the United States military conducted a successful operation to rescue an American hostage, last night. Kidnapped overseas just 96 hours earlier; incredible people.(36:56)
The US special forces brilliantly executed a daring nighttime operation. Over the last four years, we have rescued a record 55 hostages and detainees in more than 24 countries and we pay nothing because once you pay, those numbers go very high, but this operation should serve as a stark warning to terrorists and thugs who try to kidnap our people. You cannot escape the long reach of American military and American justice.(37:36)
So this happened last night. We’re very proud of them. I was at Fort Bragg and by the way, we’re leaving the name Fort Bragg in case you had any [inaudible 00:01:45]. Let That word out if you don’t mind. Cancel culture. Let’s cancel. Let’s change everything. Naw. We’re leaving the name Fort Bragg. A lot of… We won two world wars out of Fort Bragg and other great places. Gee, let’s change the name of Fort Bragg.(38:04)
We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and we killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We eliminated the mass murder of US troops. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. So recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights; 52 years, they negotiated that deal. We did it in less than two hours and we are now forging peace in the Middle East. Already three countries and they’re lined up.(38:49)
A vote for me in the Republican party is a vote to save the American Dream. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all.(39:13)
We will hire more police, increase penalties on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Your Second Amendment.(39:40)
Which Sleepy Joe will not be doing any of that. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. And we are the envy of the world, military. $2.5 trillion but we have the finest missiles and rockets and tanks and jets. What we’ve done, submarines. We have the greatest military and our nuclear arsenal has been updated and is a tippy-top shape. And only hope to God, we never have to use it. Hope to God, we never have to use it.(40:17)
We will end surprise medical billing. Require price transparency starts on January 1st, all done. Lower drug prices even more. Going to bring them down to the lowest anywhere in the world. I’ve exercised a thing called Favored Nations. The drug companies do not like me too much and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.(40:45)
America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust.(41:26)
For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina.(41:41)
Two days from now, America’s fate is in your hands. You must get out and vote. This is the most important election, possibly in the history of our country. You must let everyone know, go get them, go grab your family, grab your boss, grab your coworkers, grab them all. Got to get out and vote. So important.(42:04)
From Asheville to Charlotte, from Wilmington to Raleigh and from Greensboro to right here in Hickory, great place. Greatest furniture in the world. I bought plenty of it and it’s much better than what they make in China. That I can tell you. I know it well. There’s a big difference. We inherit the legacy of red blooded American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes, right? These are great, great heroes, who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tame the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come.(43:11)
Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.(43:35)
Vote for Tom. Get Tom in there, right? We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we have made America powerful again; our military.(43:54)
We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again and we will make America great again.(44:16)
Thank you, North Carolina, go out and vote. Thank you."

… done that for you, for your families, for your communities and for your future of this country.(00:11)
I recently read a quote that I thought was so amazing by the legendary Winston Churchill. He said, “It was a nation that had the lion’s heart. I just had the luck to give it its roar.” How much does that remind you of our President and this movement? Did he give all of us the roar? Yes, he did. He made all of us take a hard look at our own convictions and ask ourselves, what do we want for our country? We want jobs. We want opportunity. We want to believe in American greatness, and that’s what’s on the ballot. With your help, with your support, and with your votes in two days from now, we are going to win four more years for the people’s president, my father, Donald J. Trump. Thank you, and God bless you. God bless Michigan. (04:07)
Does anybody have a coat I could use please? This is definitely not the right one. Hello Michigan, hello Michigan. And thank you very much for four years ago, but I gave you a lot of auto plants. So I think we’re even right? And we have a lot more moving in, a lot more moving in.(04:29)
Thank you very much. I love you too. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t be standing here because it’s freezing out here. Think of this this, two days, now we’re down to two days. Two days from now, we are going to win the State of Michigan again, and we are going to win four more years in that very beautiful place called the White House.(05:06)
Over the last four years, I fought for Michigan like no one has ever fought for Michigan. Before I became president, the great state of Michigan was hemorrhaging your car companies, and your car businesses. And thanks to corrupt politicians like Joe Biden, he’s turned out to be a corrupt politician, he is corrupt. Plants were closing and moving to Mexico and many other places, you know that, you know that better than anybody. There had no new plants had been built in Michigan in decades and decades before I got here. I stopped the moves, and now many plants are being built and already have been built. Plants are being expanded. The automobile business is coming back.(05:56)
I told countries, Japan, Germany, and others, “Sorry, you have to bring it into our country.” And I always used to say like, “Michigan, I think of Michigan when I think of cars,” and I’d say, “Michigan,” but I’d say, “Ohio,” and I’d say, “South Carolina,” and plenty the other places, and we’ve brought back millions of car and millions of cars produced a year. But the biggest beneficiary is right here, right here.(06:24)
I’m standing up to the global special interest who got rich bleeding America dry. You know that wind is coming right into my face. And I’m saying, it’s hard to breathe! They set this place up great. I wind is pouring in as I’m talking, it’s pouring in up the mouth, up the nose; this is very pleasant. This is very pleasant.(06:49)
I hope they don’t report this one for posterity, okay. This is a crazy place, but we love Michigan. Good job. Good job. I’m just saying, whoever set this up, they could have had a little angle, how about if they had a little angle?(07:09)
The corrupt establishment hates me because I don’t answer to them. I answer to you, which is true. I’m with your vote we will continue to bring you jobs back, to enact fair trade, you saw what we’ve done, but think of all the plants, just forget about everything else. You didn’t have any auto plants four years ago. I got Man of the Year in Michigan, 12 years ago and I left, I said, I made a speech, I said, “You know, Mexico and Canada, they’re taking all your car business. Why are you letting that happen?”(07:41)
It turned out to be quite a controversial speech. It was true, but it was controversial. It was very controversial. I laugh, I’m saying, “My people are geniuses, real geniuses.” But you know what? It turned out to be true. And since then we’ve been doing things like nobody’s ever done. Cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and ensure that more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful words, that beautiful phrase, “Made in the USA.”(08:24)
Thank you very much. So we had the luck of having Ivanka here. So I said, “Yeah, you introduce me.” And I’ll tell you, that was the shortest introduction she’s ever given me and now I understand why. I understand, thank you darling, it was actually under the circumstances not too bad.(08:42)
Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You see what’s happening, you see what’s happening. We had growth like nobody has ever seen in this country, or probably any other country, 33.1%. And they hardly, the fake news hardly makes it a story. But right now they don’t care, they’re just trying to survive. Look at them back there. They’re just trying to survive. Joe Biden will shut down your economy, raise taxes, wants a $4 trillion tax increase; he’s the only politician I’ve ever seen who said, “We will raise your taxes.” You said most of [inaudible 00:09:25].(09:27)
“Will not frack!” You know, he said that for a year, and then when he came to Pennsylvania, goes like, “Oh yeah, I guess it’s okay.” No, no, there won’t be energy. They’re going to go to the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal will destroy our country. The Green New Deal is done by AOC plus three, right? I don’t think they ever took, you think they ever took a course on the environment? I wonder? Did you ever have a course on, let’s say the environment? The Green New Deal… at first I thought they were kidding. Then they said, “You know, some…” Actually they are kidding, you know that? They get it, they get it, they’re kidding. But you’re going to have to pay for their kidding.(10:08)
They want to close down your factories, ship your jobs to China, eliminate private healthcare, destroy the suburbs. I got rid of the, you know, I always say, “Women [inaudible 00:10:20].”(10:22)
The women, that was them speaking; the women of the suburbs, you’ve got to love me, I got rid of the regulation that will ruin the suburbs. I cut it out. I said, “Let’s terminate it Ben, let’s just terminate it.” But if they come back, then Cory Booker is going to be in charge, and that regulation will not be good. You know, we saved the suburbs.(10:51)
They want to abolish oil, coal, natural gas, and send your state into a… You know what’s going to happen here? You’ll have a depression. You will have a depression. Your gasoline will go up to six, $7. How do you like the $2 gasoline? Did you like that? Well, you know, you’ll have it for a long time if you elect Trump, if you don’t, you’re going to be boom.(11:15)
The damage that Biden and Harris would inflict would endure for many generations, you can’t fix it easy, you can’t fix it easy. Under my leadership our economy is now grow and get the fastest rate ever recorded, 33.1%. This was announced yesterday, right? It was just announced, they didn’t make a big deal out of it. If this were announced with Obama, they’d say, “This is the greatest president ever.” You know, he’s so great that he left me 142 judges to fill, right? 142.(11:51)
You know what if I were a Democrat, and think of it, I’m a Democrat, and my president left me 142 slots of judges, that’s why we’re going to be at 300 judges, and three Supreme Court judges.(12:14)
They said, “Sir, the wind isn’t so strong.” No, it’s about 50 miles an hour. I think it’s a minus 20 degree wind chill. They caught wind chill, right? This is a true test, but I love the people of Michigan, we won, we won. It’s worth it. It’s worth it. It’s worth it. It’s worth it. We won last time, right? It’s worth it. If we didn’t win last time, I probably wouldn’t even be standing here, I’d get up here and say, “No, thanks. This is [inaudible 00:12:59].” Like the great Pavarotti, the singer, you know, he was a diva, he was the greatest of all divas, he was an incredible talent with the most unbelievable voice. And I’ve gone to concerts where he would say, “No, no, no, no. I do not feel good, I will sing tonight,” and then he’d leave. And then I’ve gone to some where it was the most unbelievable voice that ever lived. I mean the greatest, right, Pavarotti? He liked me for whatever reason. He was very terrible to other people, to me he was nice, he liked me.(13:32)
But he goes, “Donald, Donald, I will not sing tonight. You don’t have a thousand people, I will not sing tonight because I do not feel… I will leave tonight, I’ll…” and then leave. We’d say, “Ladies and gentlemen, he’s just canceled.” But when he was great, he was great. But now I feel like him, I say, “Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, I’m getting…” No, I don’t have that, I’m not a diva.(13:54)
While foreign nations are in free fall, we are creating the world’s greatest economic powerhouse. We are the economic envy of the world, and now the military envy of the world, we have the greatest new equipment anywhere in the world.(14:12)
A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under Obama-Biden. And we’re rounding the turn on a pandemic, think of that. So, and that’s a record. In my first three years, I raised middle-class family incomes $6,500. That was in a three-year period. Whereas the Biden-Harris agenda was projected, and is projected to, if you go by their crazy plan, Wall Street Journal, you’re going to lose $6,000. They’re going to take it out, and they’re going to waste it. But it’s not six, it’s much more than that. And we’re going up to a substantial number. That’s not including energy. And if you think about energy, when you’re at $2, and your electric bills are nice and low, when they get rid of all our petroleum products and other things, everything, and they go to wind; let’s build windmills all over the place, let’s litter the landscape, let’s have littered the lands…(15:17)
You know, when you build a windmill, I’m not against wind, it should be in industrial areas maybe, but it’s very expensive, very expensive. And if you want to see a lot of dead birds, all you have to do is go to the bottom of a windmill. If you’d like to see a lot of dead birds, go to the bottom of… they pile up. They don’t know what to do with them. I’ll tell you, it’s crazy. And they’re environmentalist. They want wind. And when the wind doesn’t blow, “Let’s watch President Trump’s speech tonight, State of the Union, he’s done very nice to State of the Union,” with Nancy ripping it up in the back, crazy Nancy.(15:53)
“Let’s watch President Trump, let’s watch his…” and the man, the husband would say, “Darling, I’m sorry we can’t. The wind is not blowing today; it’s intermittent.” They call it intermittent television. We’ll have a network, Intermittent Television. No, we have to power our great factories, we have to power our great, these plants, these great plants and factories and you can’t do it that way, maybe someday, but right now…(16:20)
And solar, I like solar. It’s extremely expensive and it doesn’t have near the power that you need for what we’re talking about, no. And you know, when we do what they want us to do, but China doesn’t do it, and Russia doesn’t do it, and India doesn’t do it, we will be at such a competitive disadvantage we might as well just fold up the tent. We have the number one economy in the world right now by far, by far; and we’re not losing it on my watch, I can tell you that!(16:52)
Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe, spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign-(17:03)
… American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars. Michigan lost half of its auto job thanks to Biden’s NAFTA and China disasters. You know that. It’s amazing, nobody saw the debate the other night, right? Nobody? Did you notice the way I kept saying, “Joe, why didn’t you do it?” He’d say, “Well, I would do this, and I would do that, and I would…” I said, “Joe, why didn’t you do it? You were there for 47 years, and you just left three and a half years ago. Why didn’t you do it, Sleepy Joe, you sleepy guy?” Sleepy.(17:32)
You see him now he’s got the shades on, comes out, “Hey, hey, hey. Hey, be quiet up there. Be quiet.” He said, “They keep clapping up there.” They’re all our people. We have more people show up. They’re our people. He’s very agitated. You know how angry he is? He’s so angry. You know why he’s angry? Because he’s losing, that’s why he’s angry. No, he’s very agitated. I don’t think he knows he’s losing. I don’t think he knows anything, actually.(18:08)
No, he’s very, very angry and agitated. But now he’s got the shades, what do they call them? Aviators? But they’re too small, they should be bigger. Got the little shades on, doesn’t have to work on the eyes. But it is something. Do you see the way our people… They were protecting his bus yesterday because they’re nice. They had hundreds of cars. Trump, Trump. Trump, and the American flag. You see Trump and Americans flag. Do you ever notice when you see the other side, I don’t even see much of the other side. They have no spirit, they have no enthusiasm, they have no nothing. But you know what? I don’t see them, but whenever you see a small group because it’s got to be small because there’s nobody around. Nobody cares. But you see these groups, you never see an American flag. I always say if you look at a group and you don’t see the American flag, you know that’s the opposition.(19:03)
I say to Congress, and I’m going to do very hard for this because we have to go through a big deal, but I say when somebody burns the American flag they should go to jail for one year. I say that. Even the sister… Oh, look at the sisters. You agree with me. That’s great. These beautiful sisters, wow. Well, we’re with you, you know that. Little sisters of the poor, I’m with them, and we did a good job. Are you cold? Are you cold right now? Don’t be too cold. They go, “No.” God will keep you warm, I know that. So beautiful, so beautiful.(19:48)
We’re going to do that because I thought I could just institute it, maybe do an executive order. They, “Oh, you can’t do that, sir. It has to go through a whole big deal,” but we’re going to do it. We’ll get guys like Jim Jordan and some of our great congressmen, we’ll get our great congressman. You have some of the great ones right here. We’re going to get some of our congressmen and women, and we’re going to put in legislation, you burn the American flag… I see it with Antifa they’re constantly, yesterday they were burning it. Antifa. You burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. It’s very simple. Okay? I like it.(20:29)
Biden embraced the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for your auto industry in your State. If it was okay with you, I canceled it. It never got off the ground for us. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and took the toughest ever action against China, and ended the long nightmare of American economic surrender. Now we have the USMCA, which is great for you, and your companies won’t be leaving. Just kicked in, your companies won’t be… One thing I had to have. Wait, I have to look this way so I can breathe. The wind is so strong you can’t breathe, I’ve never had that before. It’s pouring in. Man, this is a beauty. This is a hell of a day. You guys must love Trump. This place is packed. It feels so good, when I look at them it’s perfect, but they didn’t set it up right. That’s okay. We’ll get by it.(21:34)
A vote for Biden is a vote to completely eradicate… You will eviscerate your auto industry. It will be terrible. We can’t do it. We’ve worked very hard to bring it back. I met with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, great guy, he’s since retired. He had a problem with health, but fantastic man. I said, “Shinzo, you have to send plans to Michigan. You have to send plans to the United States.” And he said, “No, no, no. I can not do that. That is a private decision.” I said, “Shinzo, you’re a powerful man. I’m sure you can do it.” “No, no, no.” I said, “You have to do it Shinzo, because you’re making too many cars sending them here. We want them made in the United States, you have to do it.” He says, “Well, I can’t.” The next day they announced they were five companies moving to Michigan from Japan. That was Japan. He’s a great guy, that one, I’ll tell you.(22:28)
While Biden was giving China your jobs, his family raked in millions and millions of dollars from the Chinese communist party. Think of that. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who bought and is paid for… Look, he’s bought and paid for by China. How about his son? His son walks in… He’s supposed to be fair. Now, how the hell can this guy deal with China? His son’s like a human vacuum cleaner. “Hey Dad, what country are you going to today?” “China.” “Oh, good, maybe I can take in a couple of million.” But really, it’s not that. It’s much more. “Let me follow you, Dad. I’m the vacuum cleaner. Let me follow. I’ll give you a 10%. Hey Dad, I’ll give you a 10%.” He took in a billion and a half, and with no experience he’s managing a billion and a half dollars. His big one was he wants China to pay $10 million a year for recommending service. He’s going to recommend. He’s going to introduce. I guess he calls it introductory services. He’s introducing his father.(23:52)
Sister, do you think this is honest? Do you think so? They all said no. That’s good enough for me, Sister. I’ll tell you. How about Ukraine? The kid, do you have any energy experience? “No.” When was the last time you worked? “Well, I was thrown out of the military. I haven’t worked at a long time.” Oh, I see. But you know something about energy now? Well, we’d love to have you serve on the board of Burisma. Would $183,000 a month be satisfactory? “No, I’d like you to make an upfront payment of $3 million.” Okay, so we’ll give you an upfront payment of $3 million. We’ll give you 183,000 a month. Would you be? “Yes, we’ll accept that. But we want very big escalation over the course of a year.” Oh, we’ll work that out too. This is so corrupt. This is so corrupt.(24:41)
And how about [inaudible 00:07:42]? Russia, Russia, Russia. Did you see the laptop from hell? Now Shifty Schiff. Schiff, you know, the world’s most dishonest politician, Schiff? Shifty Schiff, he said he thinks the laptop from hell was created by Russia. You know in Russia they probably looked, they said, “Oh no, here we go again.” These politicians, a friend of mine said… A great guy, very successful guy. He’s not really a friend anymore because he keeps calling me Mr. President. He used to call me, “Hey Don, let’s have dinner.” Very successful, Richard. “Hey Don, let’s have dinner. Let’s get together.” And you’d talk, and you’d have fun. You know, it’s normal, right?(25:28)
Now he calls, “Hello Mr. President, sir. How are you? How are you doing? Is everything good?” I said, “Yeah, it’s good. Richard, you don’t have to call me Mr. President. It’s just, I can’t…” It’s like you lose all your friends because they’re intimidated by the office. Does that make sense? You don’t have any friends. I have my friends in Michigan. We have our friends in Michigan. Hello, Mr. President. I said, “Richard, call me Donald.” “Okay, Donald,” do what I said, “Mr. President, thank you very much.”)
Four more years! Four more years!(26:01)
Thank you.)
Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!(26:09)
Hey, at least we’re having a good time. Is there any place to have a better time than a Trump rally? It’s very serious times, but you know when it’s cold like this and it’s probably less than zero with the wind chill, and with the wind blowing directly. This was a person that works for us that doesn’t like me probably very much. But no, it’s direct. But we’re having a good time. I’m having a good time. Enjoy your contest. It’s really a contest to see whether or not we could all stand it, right? And we’ll get through it and we’ll love it. We’ll love it, and I’m loving it. If Biden wins, China wins. When we win, America wins.(26:53)
In 2016, Michigan voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as your president who is finally putting America first. If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you and nobody has ever fought harder for you. Remember this Michigan because you got to vote. The big thing, you got to go vote Tuesday. If you don’t vote for me after this deal, I’ll tell you. No, I don’t want you to do that. I want you because we did a great job, we brought back your car industry. Your car industry was finished. You would’ve had nothing left.(27:47)
If I wasn’t president, I really believe everybody would have moved back out to Mexico and these other places. By the way, the USMCA puts you on a whole different footer. You know how I know? Because Mexico and Canada didn’t love the deal. They didn’t love it. They’re not so thrilled, they like the old deal much better. They used to say every 15, “Why don’t we just keep the old deal?” No, thank you. You don’t have to take my word for it on Biden’s 47 years of treachery and betrayal, we have it on tape. You’ll see this. Where the hell is it? Oh, there. We only do this for areas that we like because that sucker is expensive. Seriously, just holding it up in this wind. Go ahead. Roll it.8:39)
My problem is I voted for NAFTA. I’m supporting NAFTA because I think it is a positive thing to do. I do not pretend to be an expert on international trade matters. (33:17)
Come on, we know.)
Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.(33:27)
That is something, that is something. I don’t know. You know what? Our country’s great. We have such great potential. You can’t do that. You can’t do that. We want to be nice. You know the good news? He’s not a nice guy, so I don’t feel bad. I don’t feel bad at all. One of the biggest issues for Michigan in this election is the subject of refugees. With this weather, you don’t have to worry about it. They’ll never come. They’re never coming. [inaudible 00:33:58] they said, ” I’m going back. This is terrible.”(34:01)
I’m going back. This is terrible.(34:16)
It’s freezing. I want to go back immediately to Syria. Syria never looked so good. To protect our national security, I suspended the entry of refugees from foreign nations, compromised by terrorism. You know that, if it’s okay with you, I’m going to do that. And you see what’s happening in France. You see that mess that’s going on over there. I called the President with condolences, but they’re having a big problem.(34:51)
Biden has pledged with Bernie, the manifesto, 700% increase. They’ve agreed to this in refugees from the most dangerous terrorist spots in the world, Syria, Somalia, Yemen. The Biden plan will turn Michigan, Minnesota, and many other Midwest great states into refugee camps, which I’m sure you’re thrilled about. Sure you’re thrilled about. He’s also vowed to terminate all of the different elements of, look, we have some very strong bans, some very, very strong bans, and he wants to terminate, I got a travel ban that was tough stuff to get it. And it was not easy, but he wants to terminate the travel ban. And we have a travel ban that works, when we have people that hate us or do have countries that hate us, they come out of regions that are a disaster. We don’t want them in our country. We don’t want them, but it would have allowed, what they want, they want to allow virtually unlimited immigration into our country. They want to allow virtually unlimited access into our country. They want to, healthcare, education. I mean the whole thing is crazy. It’s just crazy.(36:14)
There’s no way you’re putting that guy in. I don’t believe it. There’s no way. The people of Michigan are too smart and we’ve come too far together. This place was a mess. This place was a mess four years ago. And frankly, if you governor opened up your state, which she has to do, well Biden, Biden’s all about lockdowns. He loves a lockdown. Well, she’s tough on everybody but her husband, he can do whatever he wants. I’m not just running against Joe Biden. I’m running against a left wing mob, the left wing media, big tech giants. I’m running against the rhinos. They’re probably the worst of all, and a running against the swamp. The swamp is very deep and very vicious or they are not happy with the job we’ve done.(37:27)
And by the way, I don’t know if you’ve been watching what’s going on with the election and this isn’t even polls anymore, this is like fact, these are people going out and voting. We’re doing very, very well. We’re leading all over the place. We’re supposed to be leading after the great red wave is going to come over the next little while, it’s coming, it’s building. It’s got to be a wave like I think, and this is far beyond the last one. This is going to be a wave like nobody’s ever seen before. Tuesday, did you vote? Tuesday, right? Tuesday, Tuesday, super Tuesday we’ll call it, right? Tuesday’s going to be beautiful, great red wave. But we’re leading even before we get there, we’re supposed to like, they have all these crazy ballots, millions and millions of ballots. Well, we’re leading a lot of places before, we’re supposed to be way down, and then we catch up and we win, we nip them, like a race horse, right?(38:28)
But we’re leading before we get to the race. They’re very worried, and they’re very worried. They said the black community, the Hispanic community, what’s going on? It’s voting for Trump. What’s going on? They don’t get it. What’s going on? They don’t get it. They still don’t get it. People cannot stand the censorship from the media and big tech either. It’s one of the reasons we’re doing well, because they understand. They no longer feel they’re getting the truth from the media. It’s a big factor. They’ve lost confidence in the media. They have no confidence in big tech and they’re tired, very tired, of cancel culture. They’re tired of being told what to think and what to do. And I’ll tell you, it’s having a big impact in this race. People get it. People are smart. The backlash against this censorship is driving more and more people to support our campaign.(39:25)
Who would have thought this was going to happen? This took place two weeks ago, when they wouldn’t look at, where’s Hunter, right? There he is. Where’s Hunter? No, two weeks ago when they wouldn’t look at where’s Hunter, because we’ve officially made his first name Where, right? It’s everyone’s constantly. That is called the laptop from hell, and they didn’t want to look at it. They want nothing to do with it. No matter what they do. Look, the greatest crime, political crime ever in this country, was spying on our campaign that they got caught, right? That was the greatest crime. And let’s see what happens. Let’s see what happens.(40:06)
But this is something that’s really big and they don’t even want to talk about it. They don’t want to write about it. They don’t want to talk about it, but you know what the people understand and you get to see it. You have a small handful of young, arrogant, obnoxious, also brilliant young people. They’re worth a lot of money. Silicon Valley CEOs. And they’re trying to take over our world. Not going to happen. Hey, let’s “So this. They said to me, the first election, they said, “Sir, you can’t fight big tech and you can’t fight the media.” And then we won. And I said, “Oh really?” Now they say it again, “You cannot fight big tech and you cannot fight the media.” I want to win again, if, for no other reason, for no other reason.(40:56)
But you can defeat them. If you have the right ideas, the right policy, if you have the right thoughts and you have people that are smart and they don’t go for fake news because it’s fake news, I’ve been calling it, one of the great terms, I hope they give me credit for fake news. That was a great term. Now I call it corrupt news, because it’s gone beyond fake. It’s totally corrupt. But vote on November 3rd, you vote. We’re going to have an election. And you know, I never thought I’d say, because what we did was incredible four years ago, this is more important. This is going to be the, this could be the most important election in the history of our country.(41:36)
Because if that side gets in, those maniacs, AOC plus three. Ilhan Omar, Ilhan Omar. They’re going to put Ilhan Omar in charge of immigration. She will be in charge of immigration. If these people, they’re maniacs, who don’t like our country. You think Ilhan Omar, that’s one of the reasons we’re going to win Minnesota, because of Ilhan Omar. How the hell did she get elected? I guess she’s got a little group of people.(42:14)
Didn’t she harvest? I heard she ballot harvested, didn’t she? So where is our Justice Department? Everybody’s telling me stories, have a great writer in Minnesota. And he writes stories about her volumes and nothing ever happens to her. Ilhan Omar, she’s harvesting ballots. It’s illegal, right? They have a story. So where the hell? Why aren’t they looking at her?(42:39)
If I did that, they’d be looking at me. They’d be looking at anybody here to disgrace. Honestly, it’s a disgrace. And AOC, right? AOC, didn’t she steal $2 million out of her campaign? Didn’t AOC steal $2 million out of her campaign? So why aren’t they looking at her? Why aren’t they looking at her, Justice Department, the Justice Department, they should be looking at. She stole $2 million out of her campaign, AOC plus three, right? It’s unbelievable.(43:14)
This election is a choice between the Biden depression, because you will have a depression. He’s going to raise your taxes. He’s going to put regulations back in. All of those plants that moved in, they’re going to close up and say, “We’re going back to Japan. These people are crazy,” right? Or you can have the greatest economic boom in the history of our country. It’s a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown, he wants to lock it down and a safe vaccine and you do it without the vaccine too. But the vaccine is going to make it quicker. It’s coming in a matter of weeks, it’s going to be distributed immediately. We’re going to start with the seniors, but it’s going to go very, very quickly, very, very quickly. It’s going to be really fantastic. It’s going to be, I think you’ll see something that’s going to be absolutely amazing.(44:05)
And thanks to our groundbreaking therapies, here I am, therapy. No, I don’t know if it had any impact, but I sure as hell felt good the next morning. I like to say no, it’s because I’m in perfect physical health. I’m a perfect physical specimen and I’m very, very young. I feel young. I didn’t need therapy, but I said, “Give it to me anyway, just in case.” And we’ve already reduced the fatality rate by 85%. Think of that.(44:40)
The Biden Plan is to imprison you in your home. But that’s what you’re going through right now with this governor. This governor, I got to tell you, your governor, your governor is not doing a good job. She is not doing a good job. I mean, think of it. Your state, we have other states, they’re open. Florida, look at Florida. Look at Texas. Look at Arizona, the great job they’ve done there. They had a spike and they wiped, they focused on the elderly and this and that, all the things, and they’re open and they’re doing great. Your state is blocked down at it’s your governor. You know what’s going to happen? On November 4th, she’s going to announce, we’re going to open up the state.(45:25)
See, she thought that the numbers and she, and by the way, North Carolina, right? And let’s see, Pennsylvania is shut down. It’s shut down, locked down. It’s all locked down. On the fourth, which one? Yeah. Well, New York, absolutely. New York’s become a ghost town, sister. What they’ve done, what Cuomo has done to New York is unbelievable. It’s terrible. It’s terrible. What they’ve done in New York, and you take a look at certain things. I mean, and then with crime, take a look at Portland. We want to go into Portland so badly. Our guys would solve the Portland problem in about 12 minutes, right? But we have to be asked because we play nice nowadays. We have to be asked by the governor. We keep asking, “You want us to go in yet?” No sir, let a few more stores burn down. That’s Antifa, that’s anarchists.(46:18)
And you know what? They’re easy. They’re so easy. They’re so easy. Look at what happened to Chicago. Do you know, we’re talking about all Democrat run cities, all run by the left or the radical left. And these are the problem areas. The Republican cities, it’s fact, they’re all doing great. We’re doing great, the Republican cities. That’s why you can’t have a radical left and Joe’s not really radical left. He’s shot, it doesn’t matter. He’s shot. Let’s face it. I mean, let’s face it.(46:53)
Oh, by the way, those slips, those are the easy ones. We didn’t want to go any worse. They’re much worse than that. They’re actually, they’re so bad that they’re not even funny. The Biden lockdown will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings for you, no Thanksgivings, no Easters, no Christmases, no Fourth of Julys and no future. Other than that, I think he’s doing quite a good job, right? Under Biden’s lock down, you will be living in a prison state. That’s what it is. They want to lock it down. Let’s lock our country down for a couple of years and let it go away. And by the way, those are the people that do the worst. They’re the ones doing the worst. Europe imposed draconian lockdowns and cases were surging and deaths were surging. But think of it, draconian. Now they have to do it all over again. What the hell are they doing? I think I’m going to go over and explain it to them. But they’re locking down parts of Europe again.(47:52)
By the way, when you think about it though, in all fairness, look what China has done to the world. Okay? No, no, look, I made a great trade deal with them. They ordered, two weeks ago, they ordered the largest order of corn, the largest order of soybeans, the largest order of beef ever in the history of our country. You know what? It doesn’t matter to me anymore. It’s almost like, it doesn’t matter to me anymore. And obviously they did the big order. It was the biggest order ever. So the farmers love Trump. They should love Trump, with what I did with ethanol.(48:26)
And a great poll just came out in Iowa. You saw that right? De Moines Register. Trump is winning by a lot. I’ve been great. And I got China to give the farmers $28 billion, because China targeted the farm, and all of that stuff. But look at what China has done to the world. Forget us. It’s us and Europe and the world. When you see Europe, is draconian shutdowns, and they’re shutting and they’re surging. This is all, it all came out of China and they could have stopped it. They stopped it from going to the rest of China. If they stopped it at the Wuhan province, they stopped it, but it came to us and it came to Europe and it went to, 188 countries are suffering. I mean, look at what China, just think of it.(49:17)
Look at what China has done to the world. Look at you with the masks and everything else. Look at what, today you should wear them anyway, probably. But seriously. Look at what China, look at what China has done to the world and we’re not forgetting it. We’re not forgetting it. And the reason they ordered the corn and the reason, you know why? Because they now figured out, we’re going to win. We’re going to win.(49:43)
And if Biden ever won, China will own the United States of America. Because he has no clue. He’s not a smart person. And in prime time, he wasn’t a smart person. He was always known as a dummy. He was always known as a dummy and that was 20, 25 years ago. And now he’s a dummy and a half. Biden will trap you in a dark winter. Remember during the debate, it will be a dark winter. Oh, how inspiring, how wonderful. Harry, let’s watch the debate tonight. I want to be inspired by the person running against President Trump. This will be a dark winter. Oh great. That’s wonderful. Harry let’s vote. Let’s vote for Trump, please. I mean, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were beating everybody. China was, we were going like a rocket ship up from China. If you read your books over the last, if you were into this world, for 10 years, they said, 2019, China will eclipse the United States as the number one biggest economy in the world. I was going like this. But then we got hit with the plague from China. We then got hit with the plague, but now-(51:03)
… From China. We then got hit with the plague. But now, when you see the number that was released on Thursday, you say, “Wow, Trump was right.” And that number could only be… I mean, whoever thought of that? 33%, 33.1% increase. It beat the number? You know, second place was 1952, and the number was less than half. So, we got it going, but you know what? We’ve gone through a lot. We’ve gone through a lot. The whole world has gone through a lot. For what? For what? Why have we done it? (51:38)
So, I’m delivering the great American comeback, and we’re not having any lockdowns, okay? That, I can tell you. There’s no lockdowns. Joining us today, your congressional candidate, Lisa McClain. Where’s Lisa? Where’s Lisa. I heard you’re doing well. Do well. Are you cold enough? No, you’re just fine. Thank you. Good luck. And Michigan GOP chairwoman, who’s doing a fantastic job, Laura Cox. Laura? How’s it going, Laura? Good? We’re going to win? I think so. I hear we’re going to win. And Michigan GOP co-chair, Terry Bowman. Terry? Thank you. Thank you, Terry. Good job. We could have picked a little better day.(52:31)
For 47 years, Joe Biden viciously attacked African Americans. We know that. He shipped away your jobs, decimated the black middle-class, and flooded your cities with foreign labor, gangs, and drugs. He opened and he openly called… And I think everyone knows this. He openly called young black men “super predators.” In 1994, the Crime Bill, he devastated black families in places like Philadelphia, Atlanta, Milwaukee, Detroit. I reversed that injustice with a landmark criminal justice reform. And I’ll tell you, nobody else could have gotten it but me. We had a lot of help. Nobody else could have gotten… Obama never even tried. Nobody tried. Biden said that if black Americans don’t vote for him, you ain’t black, which is a famous, famous thing. But that’s not nearly as bad as other things he did. So, I have a message for every African-American voter in Michigan and across America. Tuesday is your chance to show Joe… And you know that, right? Tuesday is our big deal as a country. Show Joe Biden and the Democrat party what you think of their decades of betrayal and abuse.:52)
USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.(54:03)
Tuesday is your chance to show Joe Biden what you think of his decision to mistreat abuse and wrongly imprison So many African-Americans, and that’s what he did. That Crime Bill was a disgrace, and you know that’s what’s happening in Florida? So, we’re doing well with African-American… We’re doing very well, but a lot of them just aren’t showing up because they don’t want to vote for this guy. Typically, they vote Democrat. It’s changing a lot. It’s changing really fast.(54:33)
And by the way, John James is a very good guy. I hope you’re going to be voting for him. John James, a very good guy. And he’s running against the guy… Nobody even knows who he is, Peters. I was there three years. I said, “Who’s Peters?” “Oh, he’s a Senator. He’s a Senator from Michigan.” Nobody knows who Peters is. He does nothing. He’s a puppet for Schumer. No, you should vote John James. He’s a great young guy. The great young man, West Point, a great military background, did well in business, and he wants to do this, and he’s doing us a favor. I think he could be a star. And I hope Michigan goes for John James.(55:20)
To every black American, I’m asking you for your vote. I’m asking you to send a message to the corrupt Democrat establishment, that it is corrupt. We welcome you to the Republican party. By the way, it happens to be the party of the late, great Abraham Lincoln, right? Can’t do better than that. Under our platinum plan, you heard about that, we’ll create three million new jobs for black Americans, increase access to capital, and deliver school choice to every family [inaudible 00:55:50]. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. We also passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, which is incredible for our great veterans. We had a 91% approval factor rating the other day from the veterans, highest ever.(56:11)
We killed the leader of ISIS. You that who that is? Al-Baghdadi. They’ve been looking for him for long time. We took out the mass murder of US troops, and many other troops, and many other people, Soleimani is dead also. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they worked on that. I got it done in two hours. And instead of endless war in the Middle East, peace is breaking out. Countries are lined up. They’re all lined up. We’re signing them one by one. Biden will plunge America- (57:06)
What? (57:13)
Oh. That’s very good. Let me see that. Good. Thank you. Thank you, sweetheart. Thank you. Biden will plunge America and the world into one ridiculous war after another. He thinks he’s a tough guy. Remember what he said a year ago? “I’d like to take him behind the bar.” You know what? Boom. I didn’t even have to close. I just, ding, he’s gone. He’s a tough guy, right? With his sunglasses. His new deal is his sunglasses. His new deal are those sunglasses. He was very agitated, right? See him just [inaudible 00:57:49]. And then, you’d have two cars honks. Honk, honk. We have more in the 10 feet of the front row than he had yesterday. And I hate to say it, Obama doesn’t draw any better. They went as a two-some, and they had less people.(58:12)
A vote for me and the Republican party is a vote for the American dream. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America… It’s getting warmer now. Do you notice? Let’s stay here longer. I don’t want to… I came here for the worst… Now, it’s getting good, and I’m supposed to leave. I’m not leaving. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China. That’s already happening. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assault on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities.(59:05)
We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. January 1st it starts. It’s going to be incredible. Lower drug prices even more. We’re going favored nations. You’ll get them down 70%, 80%, and 90%. We go from the highest to the lowest in the world. Protect social security and Medicare, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.(59:55)
America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first station to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ” In God, we trust.”:00:33)
In God, we trust.(01:00:36)
For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Michigan. You didn’t see me leave, did you? I’m lucky. You better get out there and vote.:00:59)
We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you.(01:00:59)
Thank you very much.:00:59)
We love you.(01:01:15)
I love you too. I do. Two days from now, you have the power, with your vote, to save the American dream, to save our country from what could happen to it. You look at Venezuela, you look at so many other countries. 20 years ago, Venezuela was a strong country. It was one of the richest countries. Today, they have no water. They have no food. They have no medicine. They have nothing. This is the same ideology that you’re seeing, trying to come in. We can’t let it happen. This country, and I’ve said it many times, will never be a socialist country. This will never be.(01:01:55)
But you have to go out and vote on November 3rd. We must finish the job. Drain the swamp. The swamp is deeper, and stronger, and more vicious than ever, but we’ve done a hell of a job, and they cannot believe that we’re in this position. We’re now leading. Look, we’re leading in Florida. We’re leading in Georgia. We’re leading… Forget Texas. We’re leading. So, how about Texas? You go to Texas. This guy says, “Yeah, we’re against oil.” Right? “We’re against God. And we’re against guns.” We’re going to take away your guns. So, now, we’re in Texas. You can’t have any more oil, no more oil wells. Let’s take all the oil wells away. So, no oil, no God, no guns. And then they say, “It’s a very close race in Texas.” I don’t think so.(01:02:45)
They did that four years ago, and I won in a landslide, right? They said, “Texas is too close to call.” The doors close. Donald Trump has won Texas. What the hell happened? They said it with Utah. Remember? They said the guy came in, he came, this character. Nobody ever heard of him. He was supposed to be great. And they kept talking about him. And then, I won by, what, 22 points or something. In fact, crazy Hillary, crooked Hillary came and… Here we go. Watch. Here we go. They always blame me. Whenever that chant starts. All I do is I mention her name.:03:21)
Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up.(01:03:28)
I didn’t do anything. Well, they said, with your governor, every time I mentioned her name, they say the same thing. And they say, “He is inciting.” I’m inciting. On Tuesday, Michigan is going to make history once again. You made history. And by the way, so I came here a lot, and we ended up winning it. It hadn’t been won for many, many years by a Republican. Are you happy with your choice? All right?:03:57)
Yeah.(01:04:01)
All those plants that you have opened and opening, by the way, and you have plenty coming too. You wouldn’t have any of them if I weren’t your president. I can tell you that, and you have plenty more coming. For generations, America’s destiny was made, forged in one in places like Midland, Makena, Lansing, and Grand Rapids. Grand Rapids, that was where I made my last speech, right? I made my last speech. 32,000 people showed up at one o’clock in the morning. And I said, “We’re not losing.” We had a crowd. You wouldn’t believe it. One o’clock in the morning. It was now Election Day because it had gone over. One o’clock, 32,000 people, Grand Rapids. I’ll never forget it. And I said, “This doesn’t feel like I’m coming in second place.” And guess what? We didn’t.(01:04:51)
Battle Creek and Macomb County. Our American ancestors gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come.:05:32)
Is yet to come.(01:05:32)
That’s true. That’s true. Proud citizens like you helped build this country. And together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.:05:54)
Winning, winning, winning.(01:06:01)
We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, with the incredible people of Michigan, we have made America powerful again. Our military, our military, so powerful. We have made America wealthy again. Look at what’s happening. 401ks are doing very well. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again.:06:39)
Make American great again.(01:06:39)
Thank you very much, Michigan. Thank you. Look, it’s warm out here now."
trump_raw_michi_nov2_clean.txt,"(01:20:16)
Thank you very much Grand Rapids, you know, this is … This was our final night prior to a very, very big victory, that was it. Remember? We left at around 1:00 in the morning. I got home, my wife said, now First Lady, said, “You have to be kidding.” We came home late and then we watched the beautiful victory, and we’re going to have another beautiful victory tomorrow. And we’re going to win the state of … You know what we’re going to win, we’re going to win the state so easily. We’re going to win the state of Michigan so easily. We want to do it just like last time. But let’s give me a little bit more margin than that if you don’t mind. (01:21:18)
So we’re going to win the state of Michigan and we are going to win four more years in that very beautiful, beautiful, beautiful house. It’s called the White House. We made history together four years ago, and tomorrow we’re going to make history once again. So this has been really, this was amazing, Grand Rapids, I’ll never forget it though.(01:21:44)
We were called, late in the evening, Ronna, thank you very much, wherever you may be. She kept calling, say, “One more trip, one more trip to Michigan, I’m telling you, one more trip.” And then we heard crooked Hillary was coming back because they were hearing … Oh, you know, Michigan hadn’t been won for a long time, many, many years by a Republican. We heard that Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary, Bill, and Bill was the only one that got it right. Said, “You don’t want to run against Trump,” he said that very early. He was the only one, he’s the only one that understood what was going on actually.(01:22:23)
But they came and they came and they wanted to be in Michigan, which was unscheduled. So I got a call from Ronna, the whole group, and they said, “Could you go back?” We got here at 12:00 in the evening, I started speaking at 12:30, now election day, I’ll never forget it. We had 32,000 people, almost as many as we have tonight. And I said to my team, “We have to … This is it.” We’ve done five, but actually six, because we ended up last night around 2:00 in the morning in Miami, so we can say that includes this … So that would be six. We’ve done six of these big, and every one was just a lot of people. And you know what? There was a lot of love. There was a lot of love. We had a lot of love.(01:23:15)
We had 45,000 people in Florida last night. By the way, we’re doing very well in Florida. We’re doing very, very well in Wisconsin. We’re doing very well in Texas, I hear great things about Texas. You know they’re saying Texas may be even … Well, you know, then you think sleepy Joe Biden’s against guns. That’s not good for Texas, right? He’s against oil. Oil isn’t good. If you’re against oil, that’s not good politics, right Texas? And he’s against god. Right?(01:23:54)
When you have guns, oil, and god, and he’s doing well in Texas, I don’t think so. But I actually know for a fact we’re doing very well in Texas. I think we’re doing very well all over. I think you’re going to have, I don’t know if it’s as much of a … I don’t know what’s a surprise. We fulfilled everything we said we were going to fulfill, and that’s why people are [inaudible 01:24:17](01:24:19)
And we did some things that we never even talked about, right? We never talked about Space Force. We got it. And I said you know what? I looked at Russia, I looked at China, and I said, “We need Space Force.” And we did it, first time in 74 years, not since the Air Force.(01:24:34)
But I want to thank you all. We have a great group of people here. I’d like to show our appreciation for our phenomenal vice president, Mike Pence, and his amazing wife Karen. Did he make a good speech? I saw him on the plane and I couldn’t sort of … Did he make a good speech? Huh? He’s great, I’ll tell you what. It was close, it was close. If I had my choice between Mike and Kamala, I think it’s a very close choice, but I think I’ll take Mike. I think we’ll stick with Mike and Karen. No.(01:25:14)
By the way, how badly did he beat her in that debate? Did you ever hear the expression, if that were a fight they would have stopped it. (01:25:27)
But anyway. No, Mike’s been great from day one, and I appreciate it. I also want to thank Don, Jr., Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany. Words cannot express how proud you make me every single day. No matter what happens tomorrow, I’m very proud of you all. (01:25:46)
But if we don’t win I’ll never speak to them again. They like him. They like them all. No no. I’m very proud. We’re very proud of you. Thank you. Look at these people. There’s a lot of spirit here. A lot of spirit.(01:26:08)
No, it’s funny though, I kept saying we have to finish off here. We have to do it. It’s just we could be a little bit superstitious, right? But you people, you’ve been great, you’ve been great. And I think we’re going to have a tremendous victory in Michigan.(01:26:22)
Don’t forget, four years ago I said, “Why are so many car companies leaving?” You know, you were losing everything to Mexico and to China and to frankly Canada, and you were losing everything. And we stopped it, and now you have many, many car plants that have already been built, are being built, renovations, 17 … You didn’t have a deal in like 42 years. It was always going out. Now they’re all coming in. I want to thank Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I said, “Shinzo, Shinzo, you got to do me a favor, Shinzo. You got to build some plants.” And he said, “No, no, no, we are the government, we don’t do that. That’s up to the private sector.” I said, “No, Shinzo, you got to do it. You got to do it. It’s not fair. You’re sending too many cars and they’re built in Japan. We wanted them built in Michigan, we wanted them built in Ohio, we want them built in South Carolina and North Carolina. We got to do it.”(01:27:17)
He says, “But I do not do that, Donald.” And the next day they announced five companies are coming to Michigan. But he’s a great guy. And he retired. He had some difficulty with his health, but he was a great prime minister of Japan, and he did a great favor to Michigan and to us, all of us, he’s a … We have a lot of activity in Michigan. It would be nice if your governor would open up the state, however. Would open up the state. Open up your schools, open up the state, go back. Get back to business. (01:28:02)
The only one that’s allowed to roam free is her husband. What’s her husband like? Remember? That wasn’t so long ago. He’s allowed to do whatever he wants. But everybody else, you’re not allowed to leave your house or your apartment. No, she’s got to open it up. Well they will. On November 4th, she’ll announce, “Okay, now we’re going to open.” You know, they’re doing that for political … They think it hurts us in the election. Actually it helps us, okay? Who has voted so far? Has anyone voted? Okay, good. Because you’re saving it, right? You’re saving it for Tuesday? Right? No, we’re cool. We’re going to have a red wave, they call it the great red wave like nobody’s ever seen before. Like nobody’s ever seen. So based on just early results though, Florida looks like it’s phenomenal. Just phenomenal. North Carolina’s looking great. I think they’re all looking great. Ohio is looking fantastic.(01:29:05)
You know, we won Ohio last time by eight points, and I said, “Well why are …” These fake polls that they put out, they’re called suppression polls. If they make them bad enough, they hope you don’t want to waste your time and vote, right? We love our president, but if he’s losing by 250 points, let’s stay home and have dinner, darling.(01:29:27)
It doesn’t work, because you people don’t, you don’t go for the bait do you? (01:29:31)
It’s really amazing. And I think we’re winning. I think we’re going to win everything. I think tomorrow’s going to be- (01:29:41)
… one of the greatest wins in the history of politics.(01:29:49)
I want to give the very special thank you also to Jared Kushner, who is in the process of negotiating a little thing called peace in the Middle East. Great guy. Great guy. They like that. They like the sound. Peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand, no blood in the sand, and no cost, just peace. Already three countries, UAE, a great leader, Mohammed, great leader. And three countries have already signed. Bahrain. It’s already signed. Sudan. And we have many, many countries, how many do we have lined up? It’ll be more than 10.(01:30:41)
Now what would happen if sleepy Joe Biden had to take over the deal? You know what happens? That’s the end of that deal. You can forget that deal. The sleepy one.(01:30:51)
Lara Trump, thank you Lara, what a job you do. What a job you do. You know, Lara’s a specialist on a place called North Carolina, I will tell you. She lived there and she grew up there and they love her there, and Pennsylvania, that extends to Pennsylvania next door, and you said that we’re doing phenomenally there, right? So I think that’s right. She said win. I think they’re both wins, big wins. We got to be careful though, because the Pennsylvania deal with that decision, oh, you can count the ballots later on, and count them whenever you’d like. No. No. We have to be very, very careful with that, that causes a lot of problems.(01:31:32)
I want to thank Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly is fantastic, from day one. I’d watch her on The Five, and she always liked me, right from the beginning, so I always liked her. If they don’t like me, I never like them. It’s funny the way that works. But she was their big star, and she did great, and thank you very much Kimberly, I appreciate it very much.(01:31:59)
And Tiffany, thank you for the job you do. She goes around from place to place. She just graduated from law school. She just graduated from Georgetown. She did a great job. Thank you, honey, thank you very much. And Michael, thank you very much. Thank you very much.(01:32:17)
To all of our supporters here tonight, I really want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We’ve worked very hard in four years. We’ve been hit by fake, fake investigations, fake scandals, fake impeachments.(01:32:30)
We’ve had so many things that, the witch hunt, I call it the witch hunt. And it turned out to be a phony witch hunt, and they should have known it the first day. They did know it the first day. But it’s the deep state, it’s whatever you want to call it, but it should have never happened. Think of it. They spied on our campaign. They got caught. They tried to take down a duly elected president of the United States. They got caught. And you know who knew all about it? Barack Hussein Obama and sleepy Joe Biden. They knew all about it. They knew all about it. (01:33:12)
And then I watch the fake news back there, look at all of them. Look at all of the fake news, isn’t that nice. It’s a lot of fake news. Then I watch the fake news saying, “You know, his attitude is a very tough attitude. He’s not very nice, he’s a very nasty person.” No no. We’re defending ourselves, and we’re defending all of these people that voted for us. With these fake …(01:33:38)
And then what happens? It turns out to be that it was them that were guilty of all of these horrible crimes. Including the crime of treason, because when you try and take down a duly elected president, you know, it’s called treason, it’s called big stuff. It’s big stuff. So we’re going to see how that all works out. We’re going to see how that. But that’s another reason we want to go for a long time, frankly. Because you know what? We started something incredible. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We then had to close it down for a period of time. We saved millions of lives. Remember the original estimate was 2.2 million people would die from the China plague, and they could have kept it in China. They didn’t get infected in the rest of China after Wuhan Province. But it came out to the world, it came out to Europe and the United States and 188 countries all over the world. And we can never forget that.(01:34:43)
We signed a great trade deal with China, but it doesn’t mean so … The ink wasn’t dry, and all of a sudden this happened.(01:34:52)
But the job we’ve done, when you see the numbers, and you’re going to hear the numbers because they’re coming out very soon, the job we’ve done has been an incredible job. We had to close it up. We saved millions of lives. We now opened it up. You saw what happened. 33.1%. The fastest in the history of our country. The fastest growth, the biggest growth in the history of our country.(01:35:18)
But you’ve been there right from the beginning, we’ve all been together, and I’ll tell you what, we very much appreciate it. And think of how it could have been different, except I think in a way we would have been less popular. Somebody said, because they would have said just another presidency. This time, you know we had to fight for you. We had to fight. You understood it. You understood the hoax better than anybody. It was a hoax. The Russian hoax. And after spending $48 million, 18 angry Democrats, and smart people, vicious, they were vicious, they were smart. If they could find any little morsel.(01:35:54)
And they went over taxes. And they went over everything you can go over. They spent $48 million, two and a half years. The Mueller investigation scam. And they come up, no collusion, there’s no collusion after all of that. Which makes me perhaps the most innocent man anywhere in the history of the United States.(01:36:22)
Now a friend of mine called me up, very smart guy. He said, “I can’t imagine anybody could go through two and a half years, $48 million, 18 killers, some of whom worked for Hillary Clinton, right? Crooked Hillary. And it turned out they’re the ones dealing with Russia. What a disgrace.”(01:36:41)
So let’s see what happens. It’s too bad it’s going so slowly. There’s plenty of info there, and I try and stay uninvolved. Someday I’m going to have to get involved, maybe. I try and stay uninvolved. Going too slowly. “No sir, we’d rather not do anything before the election.” Well they did it to me before, they did during, before, and after. These are bad people, Comey, the worst director in the history of the FBI. A crooked person.(01:37:12)
Did you leak? Remember? “Chuck Grassley. Did you leak the information to the newspapers?” He choked when he heard Chuck Grassley from Iowa, great gentleman, great gentleman. He looked at that guy, he said, “Did you leak?” And he said, “Yes.” He choked. You know the guy choked like a dog, Comey. He leaked, he lied, he did a lot of things. You saw the report by Inspector General Horowitz, who by the way did a great report. That was a great report, Inspector General Horowitz, and I appreciate it. But you saw that on Comey. Comey should hang his head in disgrace.(01:37:48)
But we had to go through all this stuff. Think if we didn’t have any of it.(01:37:53)
We probably wouldn’t have done as well. It’s true. We might not have done as well. And we might not have these massive crowds, because you saw what was happening. You got it. We might not have had … So I just want to tell you, we appreciate you so much. We really do. We appreciate you so much.(01:38:13)
And now we have to build on what we’ve done. Nobody has done what we’ve done. No administration has done, thank you. (01:38:22)
Wow, I love you too. (01:38:24)
I love you too. (01:38:24)
Thank you very much. (01:38:24)
Thank you. (01:38:33)
That’s really nice. You know, in the history of politics, nobody’s ever heard that expression before, it’s true. Look, Ronald Reagan, we liked Ronald Reagan, right, but nobody ever said, “We love you, We love you.” Nobody’s ever heard it before. Nobody’s ever heard it before. It’s an expression, true, you know they were covering it the other night, they looking back, oh, they want to find it so badly. They want to find somebody so badly. But it’s never been said before to the best of anyone’s knowledge.(01:39:03)
… so badly, but it’s never been said before to the best of anyone’s knowledge, and we appreciate it. I’ll tell you what, when you hear that, I had a nice life. I had the greatest life. But you know what? I’m so happy. This was the greatest decision I ever made, because we have done so much good together. We’ve done it together. We couldn’t have done it without you, and we’ve done so much, from the biggest tax cuts in history, to regulation cuts, the biggest ever. We have cut regulations at a level that nobody believed. It would take 18 to 20 years to get a highway approved. We have it down to two. It’ll soon be down to one, and it may not get approved. It may be an environmental problem. It may be a safety problem, but it shouldn’t take 20 years, it shouldn’t take 19 years, 21 years. And by the time you get it approved, first of all, you start off as a young man on a highway project, and you end up in retirement, and then you get a rejection. ” We rejected three to two,” some board somewhere.(01:40:03)
No, we’ve done a great job, and we’ve rebuilt our military. We just got a 91% approval from our veterans. The veterans just gave us a 91% approval, highest we’ve ever gotten. With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our police, support our great military, protect your Second Amendment, which has gone if sleepy Joe Biden gets … Defend religious liberty, and ensure more products are proudly made with that beautiful, beautiful phrase, right? “Made in the USA.”(01:40:44)
Next year we will be, and I mean this, I think we have such a foundation-1:40:50)
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!(01:40:50)
This group over here. They’re an activist group. Thank you very much. Thank you, fellas.1:41:08)
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!(01:41:08)
It’s a great group. Thank you. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. So you had last year was the best year you ever had. Before that was the best year. You had three of them with me, and then we got hit with the plague, and then we went back to work. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded. 33.1% last week. And if you look at the auto business, auto business, I don’t know what’s going on. It’s at a level that it’s never been at. What is that all about? What is that all about? You wouldn’t think, and this is during a pandemic.(01:41:50)
We’re rounding the turn, by the way. They hate it when I say it, but we’re rounding the turn. They used to say, “Look at the way Europe’s doing.” Well, take a look at Europe. Take a look. And what we’ve done in terms of the economy, we went down less than any major country in the world, or any country. And now we’ve gone up far faster and far higher than any country in the world. It’s not even close. And it should be tougher because of the size, because we’re a big country.(01:42:20)
We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months alone, which is another record. That’s another big record. We’ve never hired that many people that fast. While foreign nations are in a free fall, we’re creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. A recent Gallup Poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under Obama and Biden. And if Biden and Kamala … You don’t have to say it “Kamala.” “Kamala.” If Biden and Kamala Harris, who’s further left by far than crazy Bernie Sanders, right, he’s considered a strict conservative compared to her. How the hell did he ever pick her, Mike? Where’s Mike. How did that ever happen? That turned out … I don’t think that’s going to be a good pick. You’re going to find out tomorrow.(01:43:23)
By the way, she happens to be slightly against fracking. She’s still against fracking. Isn’t that amazing? Isn’t that amazing? Biden goes like, “I’m against …” For a year and a half, he’s running, running. Nobody gave him a chance because he never got more than 1% in prime time, right? 25 years ago, the guy never got 1%. And he never had what it took. He was a glad hander. Not a smart guy. Not a nice guy, either. By the way, not a nice guy. But he was, I used to call him 1% Joe, because he ran for president all the time and he never got more than 1%. Now he’s got half the intelligence he had 20 years ago and he wins. Politics is a strange business. A strange, very strange business. But if Biden and Harris and the radical left gain power, they will collapse our economy and send our nation into a very steep depression. That’s what’s going to happen.(01:44:23)
This is the only man that I’ve ever seen run for office on the fact that he wants to give you the largest tax increase in the history of our country. No, that’s his space. The good news is, he has no idea what the hell he’s saying, so it doesn’t … He goes up. Here’s his line. “Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give you the biggest tax increase in the history of our country. It will be $4 trillion.” They’re going to increase your taxes by $4 trillion. $4 trillion tax increase. That’s his campaign, and they’re going to put the money in the Green New Deal, which is conceived and designated by AOC plus three, right? AOC plus … This was their deal. I think they ever took an environmental course. Did they go to college, by the way? I don’t think they ever took a course on the environment.(01:45:18)
But Biden wants to raise your taxes $4 trillion, massively increase regulations. You know, the regulations may have been more important than even the big tax cuts that you got. The biggest ever. You got the biggest tax cuts ever, and you know it. You know it. You felt that in a very, very good place. You know where it is? Your wallet. You felt it in your wallet. They want to close down your factories, send your jobs overseas, destroy the suburbs. Women of the suburbs, please, okay? Please.(01:45:55)
I wiped out a regulation that would have destroyed your home, to put it mildly. Would have destroyed your American dream. And Ben Carson is a great guy. I said, “Sir, why don’t we just do this? Why don’t we just sort of ease it up?” It’s a horrible regulation. What it does is a horrible thing, and everybody knows it. It would have destroyed the suburbs. I said, “Ben, let’s just cut it out. Let’s terminate it because there’s no negotiating here. Let’s just terminate it.” And I terminated it. And you know one thing I know about? The women of the suburbs, they want two things. They want their home. They want their family night, but they want safety, and they want security. And that’s what we provide.(01:46:38)
And I think this will be like four years ago. Remember? “Donald Trump will do very poorly with women.” At the end of the evening when they’re all crying, and I remember they were crying. Remember? Martha Raddatz. Oh, she was very impartial. She was another one of my debate anchors. I had some real beauties, didn’t I? She was crying, and they all said we’re going to do badly with women. I’m going to do terribly with women. I said, “Why? What’s so bad? Tell me what’s so bad.” And at the end of the evening, “He’s done very well with women. What happened?” No. But this time we’re going to do even better, because we are providing safety and security. And for the suburban women, I mean, we’re saving the suburbs. This regulation was so horrible, what it does to the suburbs. It would have destroyed the suburbs as we knew them.(01:47:30)
And I got to say this, 31% of the people living and moving to the suburbs are minority groups, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American. And they have a great American dream also, and then they want to live in the suburbs and they want to be proud, and they don’t want to live next to a project that somebody puts in because they play games with your zoning and other things. And all I can say is, for the women … I don’t even talk about the men in the suburbs. I don’t care about the men in the suburbs. I only care because they’re all saying … He’s going, “Oh, what about us?” I don’t worry about you.(01:48:13)
But the women of the suburbs are going to vote for President Trump, because we love you, and we’re saving you a horrible, a horrible thing was going to happen, frankly, and it’s been happening for years, and it’s been a very bad situation. So we solved it. We terminated it. It is gone. Now, if they get in, if they should get in, you can take that regulation and quadruple it, just like they want to quadruple your taxes. You can quadruple it. So I think that’ll be good. I think we’re going to have a great … Women, that’s a pretty hard pitch, but that’s the way it is, right?(01:48:48)
They want to dissolve your borders. We complete the wall in a very short period of time. We’re over 400 miles. Over 400 miles, and that’s right, Mexico is paying for the wall. You know, they like to say Mexico is, but we will have the wall completed very shortly. We’re over 400 miles right now. 400 miles, and we’re building 10 miles a week, and we now have the strongest numbers and the strongest border, Southern border that we’ve ever had. And you know what? We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally, and they have to come in through merit. We want people that can help us. We want people that can help us.(01:49:34)
They want to terminate religious liberty, outlaw private healthcare. 400 … Think of this. Think of this. Private healthcare. You work so hard. You have 180 million people that have a great healthcare plan, that love it. Private plans, and they want to end it and put you on socialized medicine. I don’t think so. I don’t think you’re going to be too happy. I don’t think … “We have a cold, let’s go to the hospital and let’s wait for nine days to see a doctor.” They want to confiscate your guns, Second Amendment, and indoctrinate your children with hateful anti-American lies. So you’ll be happy that I just signed on the plane, that’s beautiful Air Force One, and it is a beauty, I have to admit an executive order to teach our nation students pro-American values. That will be taught. Sleepy joe Biden has vowed to abolish and eradicate the American oil and natural gas industries, and he’s pledged to ban fracking. And you saw that. For a year, more than that, he’d get on stage with all these crazy people, radical left people, and they were screaming who could ban it faster. He would say, “Yes, I’d been fracking. I am totally against fracking.” For a year, “I am against fracking.” I could play 100 clips. See the board? Where is the board. I spent a lot of money for that today. He’s going, for a year, “I am against fracking.” Then he lucks out because Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren doesn’t get out, so she takes votes away from crazy Bernie, right? On Super Tuesday. And he loses by a little bit on each state, and Bernie loses again. This poor guy. Crazy Bernie. But he’s running again in four years. Don’t worry about it.(01:51:31)
No, he’s the best loser I’ve ever seen. He could lose … He lost with Hillary and they didn’t treat him too well. And then he lost, but Elizabeth Warren lost. If she would have gotten out, he would have had the votes. He would have won easily. So instead of a Crazy Bernie, I’m running against a sleepy guy, right? I’m running against a very sleepy guy. We can’t let the sleepy guy fool us, though, because he happens to be a corrupt politician, and they don’t want to write it. Biden’s energy plan will send every state into a crushing poverty situation, from Michigan to Minnesota. We’re going to win Minnesota because of Omar, and because we did a great job in stopping the riots in Minneapolis. The National Guard went in. They should have called them a lot sooner, like a week and a half. You wouldn’t have had half of your city burnt down. But Arizona, Pennsylvania. We’re doing great in Pennsylvania, by the way. I just got the word. I just got the word. We’re doing great in Pennsylvania. It’s looking good. I think you’re going to have a very exciting … You’re going to have a very exciting evening or day tomorrow, but evening in particular tomorrow.(01:52:44)
You know, when people see it, I walk in, we do polls, and they do a poll. “We interviewed 73 people, and President Trump is down 57 points.” This is a poll. See, this is a poll. When you draw crowds like this. This is not the crowd of somebody that’s going to lose the state of Michigan. This is not. This is not. And look at this crowd. You can’t even see the end of it. You can’t. This is not the crowd of a second place finisher. Do you agree with that? No. No. This is our crowd, all together. We’re in this together and we’re doing it together. As long as I’m President, we will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on this planet. And for the first time, we are energy independent. You never heard that term before. We’re energy independent, and you know, we have very good relationships in different parts of the world. In some we help. We don’t have to, though. Now we don’t have to do … We do what we want, but we have some very good allies and partners that we’ll help them, but we don’t need their oil anymore. We have so much oil. We have more oil than anybody, okay? And it’s an incredible thing that it’s happened over the last few years. A lot of great things. And you’re paying, what, $2 a gallon for your gasoline? That’s okay.(01:54:16)
You know what that’s like? That’s like a tax cut. That’s bigger than a tax cut. If Biden got in, you’d be paying $7, $8, $9. Then they’d say, “Get rid of your car. We’re going to build some more windmills. Kill all the birds.” Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that most of you have never even heard of, okay? A vote for Biden is a vote to eradicate your auto industry. Somehow I don’t think you want to do that in your particular state. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever made, and now we have USMCA, which is a great deal. What a difference. No, you were sending all your jobs.(01:55:08)
You know, 12 years ago, I was honored, believe it or not, the Man of the Year, and I was never thinking about doing this, the Man of the Year in Michigan. I’m still trying to figure out how that happened, and I got up and I said, “You know, you’re losing all your car business to Mexico, and Canada, too, by the way, and what are you doing? Why are you doing it?” And it was a whole big thing, became quite controversial as usual. But I was right, and it was probably the biggest reason that I ultimately ran for the presidency, because I saw how we were being ripped off. Not only the auto business, how we were being ripped off by every country of the world, friend and foe, on trade. And it just was something that was terrible.(01:55:50)
Now with the USMCA, they said there’s no way I would ever pull it off. “There’s no way you get rid of NAFTA.” You know why? Because Mexico and Canada loved it. I said, “Well, if they love it, that means it can’t be any good, right?” They said, “Sh, we never thought of that one.” So I wouldn’t say they’re exactly thrilled with USMCA, but we’re fine with it. We like it. But he was sending your auto jobs, so many of them, to Mexico, and it was terrible.(01:56:16)
Joe Biden supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which was the beginning of a disaster. It was good for China, but it was sure as hell bad for us. But you know, we won seven and a half billion dollars a little while ago, because we wouldn’t win anything. They had no respect for this country whatsoever, and now they know that if they don’t treat us right, we’ll pull out of that deal so fast. Now all of a sudden we’re winning all these cases, but we just won seven and a half billion dollars, which would have been impossible with a different president. You are so lucky I’ve agreed to be your president. Go out and vote for Trump.(01:56:56)
The seven and a half billion dollars we won, that was nice. Michigan lost half of all of its auto manufacturing jobs, because that was like a Biden and his friends, that was a betrayal to you and to many other states. He supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have eliminated your auto industry totally. I came in and immediately canceled it. I canceled it. I was so happy to cancel the TPP. I ended the NAFTA disaster. Canceled that one too. I’ve been an activist. Despite the fact that every week I’m being hit on all different sides, ” Let’s impeach him for having a perfect conversation with the President of Ukraine.” They were the ones that had the bad conversations, including his son making $183,000 a month to sit on the board of a company. His son. Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? His first name is, “Where.” Where’s Hunter? Remember that? I brought that up. A t-shirt was made overnight. It was the hottest selling t-shirt of the year. “Where’s Hunter?”(01:57:59)
You know where Hunter is? He’s buying vacuum cleaners, because he follows his father and he vacuums in money from every country that his father sees. No, seriously, Ukraine. His father was a judge of Russia, Ukraine, and China. President Obama entrusted him with those three countries. Those are the three beauties, right? Russia, Ukraine. So Russia, Moscow, the mayor of Moscow, his wife gives him three and a half million dollars, Hunter. Now he got dismissed from the military, was unemployed. His father becomes Vice President, and now all of a sudden he’s raking in money like you never saw. Now you tell me, is that honest? And then they say the big guy gets 10%. The big guy in some cases gets 50%.(01:58:48)
And then the last one is he asked China for $10 million here. This is Biden. They asked for $10 million, yeah, $10 million for introductory purposes. That’s what … Introductory purposes. So he’s going to introduce people to who? To his father, for which he gets $10 million a year. I never saw anything like this. And the fake news refuses to report it, because they don’t want it in there, because it’s not good for them. How about the Moscow? Three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Three and a half million dollars to, “Where’s Hunter?” You know, ” Where’s Hunter?” He’s at the bank depositing his money.(01:59:36)
Now think of it. So he gets a billion and a half from China. He goes with his father on Air Force Two, a plane that the great Vice President Mike Pence uses too. Mike, do your kids follow you to the various countries, raking in money? No. He’s got the greatest people, the greatest children, the greatest family. I don’t think they have, right, where they’re flying airplanes for our military. No they don’t. They do it a little differently. They do it the old fashioned way. No. Mike Pence, it’s a holder. I always compare … I say, “Can you imagine with Mike Pence?” How good we have it with Mike Pence compared to that. No, it’s great.(02:00:22)
How about the China, though? So the kid has no investment experience whatsoever. His father and him, they go into Air Force Two. In 10 minutes, like a 10-minute meeting, he walks out with a billion and a half dollars from China. They don’t do this for the biggest investment firms. I spoke to a friend of mine who’s one of the biggest guys on Wall Street. He said, “No, this is never done. They invest their own money. They don’t need people that are much dumber than them to invest their money. They invest their own money. They don’t do that.” Then he said, “Wow. That’s amazing. How long did it take him to get the money?” “About 10 minutes.” Walks out with a billion and a half dollars to invest, which is millions of dollars a year.(02:01:01)
And the fake news and big tech, big tech is getting very dangerous, very dangerous, but it’s one of the reasons we have to win. They have me trending every day on Twitter, Twitter Trending. They make up these stories, phony stores. They put up stories or they’ll take an old story, make it as bad. “Number one trend,” like some really boring story. Trending is like, you got to be cool, right? To trend. I’m trending number one, number two, number three. Everyone, “Negative, negative, negative.” How the hell did I ever win this thing? It’s such a fix with these people. I’m always trending with these stories that are like, either they didn’t happen, or they make them different. And I don’t want to act like a complainer, but it’s a totally rigged deal. And everyone said four years ago, they said, “Sir, you can’t win.” “Why?” “Because big tech is against you.” I said, “What’s big tech?” I didn’t even know what the hell it was, right?(02:01:52)
I learned fast, because I think we’re number one in the world now on social, so we learned very well. We got a lot of people. You know what? If I didn’t have … They say, “Don’t tweet.” Forget the tweet. It’s called social media. If we didn’t have social media, I’d have no voice. We wouldn’t be here. I have no choice. They say, “Gee, we wish she wouldn’t do so much tweeting.” I don’t do tweeting. What I do is social media. And without it, I don’t think we’d be here, because we’d have no voice. There’s no voice with these people. They’re dishonest people, mostly. Not in all cases, but Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who, what he’s done is he’s bled America dry.(02:02:34)
In 2016, Michigan voted to fire this corrupt political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because, thank you, I’m not a politician. Thank you very much. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because it was elected to fight for you, and I fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before. Joe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media, and powerful special interests. That’s why he takes in $300 million. They taken millions and millions of dollars for his crazy campaign, and he’s not going to win.(02:03:28)
I really don’t believe he’s going to win, because of this. Take a look. This is going on all over the country. They have tractors, thousands of tractors. You ever see this? Thousands in Iowa. We’re winning an Iowa very big, by the way, just in case. Thousands of tractors in Iowa on big farms, thousands and thousands. They have thousands of boats, 6,000 boats out in the lake, out in the ocean. They have things nobody’s ever seen anything like it. So I think we’re going to have a very big day, but they say you can’t win without big tech. Well, we’re going to find out tomorrow. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? But they said the same thing, they said the same thing four years ago. The head of CNN said, “You can’t win without CNN.” I said, “Really?” And we won, so now we have to do it again. They’re totally crooked. They’re fake news. CNN is fake. CNN and the others are fake news. They own Biden. They control him, and they know that he will always do their bidding.(02:04:28)
Every corrupt force in American life that betrayed you and hurt you is supporting Joe Biden. The failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars that hurt our country so badly and hurt our young people so badly, they support Sleepy Joe Biden. The career politicians that offshored your industries and decimated your factories and sent your jobs away, they support Biden. The open border lobbyists that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs and gangs and crime, they support Biden. The far left Democrats that ruined our public schools, depleted our inner cities, defunded our police, and demeaned your sacred faith and values, they support Biden. The anti-American radicals defaming our noble history, heritage, and heroes, they support Sleepy Joe Biden. Antifa, and the rioters, looters, Marxists, and left wing extremists, they all support Biden.(02:05:35)
This election comes down to a very simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the corrupt and selfless political maniacs that you’re dealing with? Or do you want to be ruled by the American people? You’re supposed to be ruled by the American people. Do you want to be represented by a career politician who hates you, by an outsider? I mean, just take a look. These people, what they do and what they get away with, and I guess that’s the other reason. I mean, I was in politics and I see what’s been happening to our country. Our country was going to hell, and we’ve turned it. And we got waylaid by this plague that came in, but we’ve done a job like nobody else has ever done a job, and you understand it. And that’s why there’s so many of you here tonight, and that’s why all over the country, this is happening. All over the country. And even they’re just springing up by themselves. I’m not there. I don’t do this. I mean, if you look, they had something today I read where 100 miles of cars all with the flag, the American flag, the Trump, a whole Trump thing.(02:06:49)
But do you want to be represented by a career politician who actually doesn’t like you, or by an outsider who will defend you like you have never been defended before? That’s what I’m doing. And it’s not easy, but there’s nothing I’ve ever enjoyed more in my life, because we are making so much progress. We have to now finish the progress. A vote for Biden is a vote to hand the keys of government over to people who don’t like you, don’t respect you, and who want to rob your children of their American dream. We have a great American dream. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let that happen. We’re going to keep our great American dream. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalists, and communists, and socialists, and wealthy, liberal hypocrites, and all of those that want to silence, censor, cancel, and punish you.(02:07:48)
If you want your children to be safe, if you want your values to be honored, if you want your life to be treated with dignity and respect, then I am asking you to go to the poll tomorrow and vote, vote, vote. Remember what I said four years ago. I am your voice, and we will make America great again, and that’s what we’re doing. For the last four years, the depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me and to stop you, because they know I don’t answer to them. I answer to you. That’s why we’re here. That’s why we’re here. Together we will defeat the corrupt establishment. We will dethrone the failed political class, and we will drain the Washington swamp. And we will save that American dream. That beautiful, beautiful American dream.(02:08:47)
This election is a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown, open up your state, governor, or a safe vaccine that ends up the pandemic and leads to the greatest economy in the history of the world. That’s where we’re going. We were there, and we’re going to get it back very quickly. And that’s going to bring our whole country together, because success brings it together, and it was happening. Before that plague came in, it was happening. People were calling me that you would least suspect, and it was all happening. And then we had to close it down and now build it up, and it’s building … It’s not a V. It’s a super V. It’s a super V.(02:09:28)
We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks. It will quickly eradicate the virus and wipe out the China plague once and for all. And whether we have the vaccine, great companies, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, but with or without it, we are rounding the turn. Just remember that. You know, they don’t like it. They hate it when I say that we’re rounding the turn. And they always use Europe. “Oh, look at Europe. Look at Europe.” Well, take a look at Europe. Look at how they’re doing. And their economy is in tatters, and they have a lot of problems, and we don’t want that. We don’t want that. And that should have never happened. Should have never happened. That should have never been allowed to happen.(02:10:07)
Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state. He’s looking you in the face and he’s locking you in your home while letting rioters, Antifa, the radical left, run down your streets, riot in your streets, burn down your stores, beat you over the head, and they’re allowed to do that. But you can’t go to your church. You can’t have dinner with your family, but you’re allowed to protest and riot. That’s why I call all of these protests, because we’re allowed to protest. You’re not allowed to meet and you’re not allowed to pray together, but you’re allowed to protest, so I call everything that we do a protest. The Biden lockdown will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Easters, no Christmas, no 4th of July, no future for the youth. Other than that, it’s actually quite good.(02:11:11)
A vote for Sleepy Joe Biden is a vote for lockdowns, lay offs, and misery. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, by the way, he would have been so far behind on a vaccine. He would have been so far behind. He did the swine flu. It was the joke of … They didn’t know what the hell they were doing. Now he’s saying, ” He should have acted faster.” Except when I did the ban on China, he said I shouldn’t do it for two and a half months. Then he admitted he wrong too, and then he runs, and now he’s saying I should have acted. I was so early in doing that ban, and we saved … And our biggest critic admits that we saved thousands and thousands of lives by doing it. Thousands of lives. And the ventilators that were made, and all of the things that we’ve done, and all of the medicines that are coming out. And here I am-(02:12:03)
… all of the medicines that are coming out and here I am, right? Here I am. And I’m sure it had nothing to do with the medicine. I used to sort of give the medicine a little bit of credit, now I give it none, because I’m a perfect physical specimen, and I’m a very young person. I’m a very young person. I said that, of course, a little bit sarcastically. I said it a couple of weeks ago. I said, “No, no, I’m better than perfect. I mean, it was very quick, very easy because I’m in perfect physical shape and I’m a very young man,” and CNN went crazy, “He is not in great shape, and he is not a young…” But they went totally crazy. They are definitely, seriously losers.(02:12:46)
Could you imagine if they had a cover of sleepy Joe for four years, their ratings would tank. That’s why football is not doing well. First of all, they’re not going to do well, basketball was down 71%, their finals. You know why? Because our people want to see people that respect our country, respect our anthem and respect our flag.(02:13:12)
And football is way down. But you know, they’re down for that reason, but they’re also down because people would rather watch this stuff than watch football, because this is much tougher. They consider this to be much tougher actually. But can you imagine if they covered sleepy Joe, the ratings are phenomenal for all of these things. And then they cover sleepy Joe, their ratings would tank. They would come to see me, “Sir, I think it’s really important that you run again because we are losing our networks, our ratings are down the tubes.” The failing New York Times will definitely be out of business very quickly. They used to write nothing about me, now I average probably about four or five stories a day on the front page. Someday they’re going to give me a good one, watch. It might be tomorrow. We got to have a big win. We want a big win, not just a wave, we want a big win. Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates said about Biden that he was wrong on nearly every single major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. He’s been wrong on everything. He’s been wrong on everything. But don’t believe me, because you’re Michigan, I spent all of this money on these beautiful, very large television sets. I call them beautiful, large screens. They’re large television sets. Let’s see it for yourself, okay. Go ahead.2:14:41)
Joe Biden. Joe Biden. Joe Biden.2:14:53)
Have you taken a cognitive test? (02:19:19)
Thank you very much. Look, you can’t let this happen to our country. Okay? We know what’s going on. You can’t let this. This was a total fluke. This was a total fluke. In prime time he didn’t work and now it’s really not working. What a disaster. I can’t believe this is even happening.(02:20:05)
It puts much more pressure on me running against a guy like this. You lost to somebody that was good, can you imagine the concept of losing to this guy? You better get out there and vote tomorrow. I will be so angry I will never come back to Michigan, I’ll never come back. I’ll tell Japan to bring all those plants they held back.(02:20:31)
Joining us tonight are some great warriors, great people. Congressman Bill Huizenga. Bill, where is Bill? Thank you very much. Everything good? You’re doing great. Thank you, Bill.(02:20:49)
Congressional candidate, Peter Meijer. Peter, where’s Peter? Where’s Peter? Peter, you don’t have a good location. What happened to Peter? Peter’s here someplace and I hear he’s doing great.(02:21:03)
House Speaker, Lee Chatfield. Lee? Thank you, Lee, great job you’re doing.(02:21:12)
RNC Chair, I’ll tell you what a job she did. What a job she did. Ronna McDaniel. Where are you Ronna?. What a job she’s done. We won this great state with her leadership. Thank you, Ronna, very much, great job.(02:21:34)
State GOP Chair, Laura Cox. Laura? Good job. Are we going to win? Otherwise, we will fire you so fast.(02:21:53)
No, I think we’re going to have a tremendous victory in Michigan. I think we’re going to have a tremendous victory in all of these States they’re talking about, I see all of them. We’re going to have a tremendous evening, I hope so. For the good of our country, I hope so. You see the alternative, I’m sorry. But this is not just an alternative. We’re doing a great job, but we want to keep it going. Okay. We got to keep it going and we’re going to.(02:22:18)
A very special person. Medal of Honor recipient, Jim McCloughan. Jim, where are you? Great job. He’s a very brave one. Thank you very much, Jim. Congratulations, that’s a great honor. Our highest honor.(02:22:36)
Ted Nugent, and he is great. Where is Ted? Great job, Ted. He’s been from day one, right, Ted? Great job. Thank you very much for everything. I appreciate it. I love your sound. I love your music. And speaking of sound, music and other things, one of the big superstars of the world, Little Pimp. There he is. How’s it going? Do you want to come up and say something? Come on. Lil Pump, come on up here, come on up here. Does everyone know who he is? You know how big he is? Come on up here. It’s a nice hat. Come on, say something.:23:32)
Hello everybody, how are you guys feeling? I’ve come here to say, Mr. President, I appreciate everything you’ve done for our country. You brought the troops home and you’re doing the right thing. MAGA 20, 20, 20, don’t forget that. Don’t forget that. And do not vote for sleepy Joe, at all.(02:23:58)
Thank you/ That’s great, thank you very much, I appreciate it. That’s very nice. Big star, big star. That’s very impressive.(02:24:29)
For 47 years, Joe Biden viciously attacked black Americans. He called young black men, super predators. To every black American, I am asking you to get out tomorrow and vote. This is your one and only chance. Thank you. Thank you, man. Thank you very much. To show Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to jail you, to betray you and I’m fighting for you and you know what we’ve done? What we’ve done is really something that nobody thought could have happened. Other administrations, in particular, the last administration didn’t make even a move to try and get it done. We got criminal justice reform done. We got prison reform done. We got opportunities zones all done and complete. Tim Scott. We had funding for historically black colleges and universities completed and done, and it’s an honor to have done it. And I say it all the time, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, no president has done as much for the black community as President Trump. And I’m very proud of that, very proud of that.(02:25:54)
Thank you. It’s been an honor. It’s been an honor. Biden has vowed to increase refugee admissions from terrorist nations by over 700%, including from Syria, Somalia and Yemen. The Biden plan would overwhelm your communities and turn Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the entire Midwest into a virtual refugee camp. I am keeping radical Islamic terrorists, if you don’t mind, the hell out of our country.(02:26:25)
And if you take a look at France over the last week, they’re having a devastating problem. Another problem happened today, a very big problem in Europe and we don’t want it. We don’t want that problem. We don’t need it. We don’t want it. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States military, biggest investment we’ve ever made. We are the envy of every country, militarily, Russia, China, North Korea. Everybody looks at what we have, nobody. Tanks, F35s, super fighter jets, tankers, submarines, missiles, rockets, hypersonic missiles, they go seven times faster than our fastest missile, fastest in the world. All of the things we’ve done in our nuclear plants and our nuclear capability is now at the highest level and it’s all in tippy top shape. And you just have to pray to God that we’d never used it. That’s all we say. Pray to God that we never use it.(02:27:34)
We have the best in the world, all by the way, made in the USA and made a lot of it made right here in Michigan. A lot of it made right here in Michigan. We also passed VA veterans choice and veterans accountability, VA accountability. 91%. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani is dead. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, had been working on that for 52 years.(02:28:24)
And instead of endless wars, we are now forging peace in the Middle East, and we’re getting it done. It’s going to happen very quickly, you watch. A vote for me and The Republican Party is a vote for the American dream. And remember, Abraham Lincoln was a proud member of The Republican Party, Abraham Lincoln.(02:28:47)
In conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all, which is already taking place. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment. Which is under siege, but it’s 100% secure with us in this position, Mike, right? We will never touch it.(02:29:32)
We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which goes into effect on January 1st, bigger than healthcare. Lower drug prices even more. We have signed and done something that’s never been done on prescription drug prices, favored nations. It will bring drug prices down 50, 60, 70%, like you’ve never seen before. And the drug companies, big pharma, does not exactly like your favorite president, I will tell you, but that’s okay. We broke a log jam. Favored nations, nobody thought we’d ever do that, we did. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That’s starting very soon.(02:30:37)
We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Michigan.(02:31:20)
Tomorrow, you have the power, with the power of your vote, but you have a power to save America, for this country will never be a socialist nation. We will never allow that to happen. Together we can finish the job and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. Nobody knew it was so deep and so vicious, but we have done some job. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and get out and vote. Most important election perhaps in the history of our country. I never thought I’d say that. After what we went through four years ago, I said, “There’ll never be anything like that. Never be anything like what we went through.” And this is the most important election, maybe in the history of our country, from Midland to Mackinac, from Pontiac to Battle Creek and from Detroit to right here in Grand Rapids, I love Grand Rapids.(02:32:27)
We inherit the legacy of American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country, our families, and our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. The best is yet to come.(02:33:04)
Proud citizens like you, who helped build this country, together we will take back our country. We’re taking it back at a level that nobody has believed. We are taking it back and we are winning and we’re going to win tomorrow. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God and together with the incredible people of Michigan, we have made America powerful again. Our military, it’s never been like this. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Michigan. Go out and vote. Thank you very much. Thank you."

Wow, what a crowd. What a crowd. Hello, Florida. Hello, Florida. We love Florida. What a great victory we had and we’re going to have an even bigger victory. Get out there and vote. We’re going to have a bigger victory. And I don’t know if you found that you’ve been here a long time. I hope the music was good. I hope life is good. Everything’s good. That’s a good looking crowd. Good looking people, I will say. No, we’re going to have a big victory. I don’t know if you know what’s happening, but… (01:19)
I don’t know if you know what’s happening, but they’re very worried, the Democrats about Florida. They’re very concerned. The vote’s not there. It’s not there for them. They had to get out to that big early lead and it could be that we’re leading, that’s a little problem. Two days from now, we’re going to win, my home state of Florida and we are going to win four more years in the White House. (01:59)
It’s a very vital group, isn’t it? With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, support our great military, protect your Second Amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that wonderful phrase, Made in the USA.(02:28)
Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You see what’s happening. You see it happening right before your eyes. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded in the history of our country. 33.1%. 33.1%. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months alone. Another record, record, record, we got many records. Now we have a chance to do something next year, even greater than last year, we had it the best ever and then we got hit by the plague from China and we will never forget. We’re never going to forget it. And then we’re building it up in a level that nobody thought possible leading every nation in the world by far. While foreign nations are in a free fall, we are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. Nothing and no one in the world is doing what we’re doing.(03:35)
Now, if somebody wants to quadruple your taxes, I can’t tell you what’s going to happen. I think I can. It’s called the depression. A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under sleepy Joe Biden and Obama. And if Biden and Kamala, Kamala, Kamala, most liberal member of Congress, she makes crazy Bernie look like he’s a very strict conservative, and the radical left gain power the economy will collapse and our country will go into a very deep and steep depression. I hate to tell you. Look, we’re not going to have to worry about it. If anything we’re going to win.(04:28)
You know who else thinks we’re going to win? The Democrats think we’re going to win, the Democrats. They’re starting to say, “This is not good.” We’re looking great here. We’re looking great in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Iowa. Did you see the poll just came out in Iowa? First big poll? We’re only up eight. I’m very upset about that, we’re only up eight. We’re looking very strong, looking strong in Georgia. We just left the great state of Georgia. We’re looking strong in Georgia. In fact, they said, “Sir, you don’t have to go to Georgia.” They said a couple of days ago, I said, “Wait a minute, people are waiting for two and a half days. I’m not going to cancel on Georgia.” I’ve been doing this since early in the morning, only for you, I guess I could have canceled you too. Right? But nobody would have the courage to cancel you. Nah, I wouldn’t even think about it. Thank you. (05:46)
Thank you. And I love you too. I love you too. We’re all in this together. We’re all in this together. Because as I’ve said many times, this will never ever, ever be a socialist nation. Sleepy Joe Biden will raise your taxes $4 trillion. Can you believe it? He’s the only candidate I’ve ever seen that campaigns on the fact, “I will raise your taxes,” this guy. “I will take away your Second Amendment. We will not frack.” For two years, “We will not have frack,” then he got to Pennsylvania, he said, “Well, I was only kidding.” Look at all the press at this time. At this… Look at that them. The fake news followed us. They followed us.(06:57)
The man, the man. Now, the only one I’ve ever seen do that… We don’t worry about them. They don’t tell the truth anyway so what difference. Just pretend they’re not here. Pretend they’re not here. They’re having a very bad couple of weeks as you know. They’ve actually had a bad four years when you think of it.(07:21)
Massively increase regulations, we cut regulations more than any administration in the history of our country and they’ll put them right back. Sleepy Joe, it won’t be him because he has no idea where he is, but he’s surrounded by a lot of very far left people. Close down your factories, send you jobs overseas, destroy the suburbs. I say, suburban women, please love me, please love me. Got a lot of suburban women, look at this. Wow. (08:09)
Don’t forget suburban women, men also, but we don’t worry about them [inaudible 00:08:17]. I’m terminating a regulation that has ruined suburbia. You too can have a project next to your house and I terminated. Oh, well we have… Is that the first sign of trouble in weeks? (08:41)
All right. Is that okay? Is everybody okay over there? Is that, somebody went down or is it somebody that’s trouble? Because if there’s trouble, we have somebody right over here that can handle it very nicely. I guarantee, I bet everything in this guy right here. You know the one that make all the noises are people, somebody shouts, they have no voice, they’re week. They have no voice. Their mother’s looking for them, their father’s looking for them. They too live in a basement usually. And nobody can hear them. What they hear is thousands of people going to, “You, watch it.” That’s all right. Just pretend the person doesn’t exist or get them out please.(09:38)
They want to terminate your religious liberty, outlaw private healthcare, confiscate your guns, your Second Amendment is under siege. Don’t worry. As long as I’m here, nothing’s happening. They want to ban fracking, abolish energy, cut your Medicare, cut your social security by allowing millions of people to come into our country and indoctrinate your children with anti American lies. That’s where we are but it’s not going to happen. You’re going to vote and it’s not going to happen. You know, we win Florida, we win the whole thing, you know that, right? We win Florida, we win the whole thing.(10:28)
Our opponents want to turn America into communist Cuba or socialist Venezuela and we’re not going to let that happen. Our opponent’s agenda is a war on workers, a war on faith and a war on our police. Biden says he’s running as a proud Democrat. I’m running as a proud American. Is that okay? (11:10)
Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars. They’re all coming back. They’re all coming home, our great soldiers. We became policemen to the world. Well, for other reasons they could very well do that, couldn’t they?(11:46)
Joe Biden is a corrupt politician bought and paid for by China. You see that? And others. In 2016, Florida voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first. If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. Probably why we won. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody in this place, except one person, perhaps him. He’s the only one that fights harder. Great guy.(12:44)
My opponent is promising a long dark winter. Did anybody happen to see the debate? See, that’s my arena. That was my arena. Right? He didn’t come out too good. He came out like your opponents come out. No, that was not good for him. How about the last question? We talked about energy, right? “Well, I’d like to transition out of petroleum.” I felt like Perry Mason. The last question of the evening, I said, “Whoa, did you tell that to Texas? Did you tell that to Pennsylvania?” Even Kristen Welker, who frankly did not a bad job considering she’s totally on the other side of the plate, she looked and she said, “Why did you say that?” She trying to save the poor guy. “This is what we got. Can you believe it. This could only happen to me.”(13:45)
I don’t care. I’ll say it anyway. Look, this is in the history of presidential politics, this is the worst candidate ever to run. This puts a lot of pressure on me because if you lose to a guy like this, I’d rather really have a great candidate because you feel better. I’m running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. (14:24)
Is there any place you would rather be than at a Trump rally? Got a lot of rich people here. My friend. You got a lot of… Oh, Steve. Hi Steve. We got a lot of rich people, a lot of money, a lot of money in this first row. A lot of money.(14:45)
I built the best economy in history, and now we’re going to do it again. You know that hat. I see thousands and thousands of them. We’re getting 35, 40,000 people all the time. We’d get more, but they don’t have any more room. How about this? You take an airport, right? You take an airport, you don’t have enough room. Did you ever think of that one? We have an airport. We don’t have enough room. This is amazing. There’s never been anything like this has ever happened in the history of politics. Probably on any other history and I don’t have a guitar. You know the truth is… No, it’s true. They don’t get crowds like this. Nobody gets crowds like this. You know what gets crowds like this? Making America Great Again. That’s what it does. It’s the only thing that’s going to get a crows like this.(15:44)
Sleepy Joe had a rally today, they had 12 people in those little circles. It’s got those little crazy circles. It’s the only thing good about his campaign, the guy that does the work, I’m a perfectionist, they’re so beautiful, nice and wide. And they can’t fill them up so they get the media, “Could you please take a circle?”(16:01)
So they get the media. Could you please take a circle? And now he’s got President Barack Hussein Obama comes in. President Obama. (16:28)
You know, the Democrats never talk about it. You know that federal judgeships are like the biggest deal, and then you have Supreme Court justices. Barack Obama left me 142 federal judges. Nothing like that’s ever happened, nothing. Very rarely does it … You know, when you’re a president, every one … You leave; every one of them is filled. Those are the most important things you can have. Federal judgeships, lifetime appointments. It’s such a big deal. He left me 142, and we are going to have … Listen to this. We are going to have, in my first term, record-breaking, approximately 300 federal judges. It’s a very big percentage of the whole federal bench. And we are going to have … We just put a great one on: Amy. Three Supreme court justices.(17:32)
And whatever happened with Biden? He was going to say … Is he going to pack the court? He just keeps tapping. Maybe he’s smarter than we think. Keeps tapping it along. And who are the people he’s going to put on? He was supposed to say who he’s … You cannot vote for him if he doesn’t tell you about packing the court. Therefore is anybody in this audience going to vote for Sleepy Joe Biden? (17:59)
I can’t imagine anyone having the courage. I can’t believe it. Look at those people. They go … Does anybody have the courage to even raise your hand? That wouldn’t be a very good thing to do. Who is going to vote on election day for President Trump? (18:19)
Who has already voted? (18:27)
Has anybody here … Seriously, we don’t mind. Not going to matter. Not going to matter. Has anybody voted? With all those people that have already voted, we have a lot of votes going out, and I think we’re leading. Can you believe? In early voting. Has any … Oh, that’s a shock. Oh, that’s the big story. They’re saying we have to get more people out. We have … Maybe I shouldn’t say that. People are watching. No, we’re doing good. No, but anybody here vote for Sleepy Joe Biden? (19:01)
Okay, good. I believe you. I believe you. This election is a choice between a crippling depression or a historic boom. It is. You have a depression. All that money, all those 401Ks, they’re got to go right down the tubes. Throw it out. It’s a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown. He wants to lock down the country. (19:29)
I just left the country … I just left a state that locked down. I left two of them, and they’re not happy about it. I’ll tell you right now. You know what’s going to happen to them? On November 4th, the day after, they’re going to say, “All right, we’ll open up now.” That’s why they’re locking down. But we’re going to have a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic. Without it, it’s rounding the … I say it. It drives them crazy. It’s rounding the turn, because all they want to do … You turn on the news: COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID. We’d like to talk about COVID, and then the next time, here’s what happens. November 4th, you won’t hear too much about it. You won’t hear too much about it. (20:27)
Don’t tell anybody, but let me wait till a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice. I appreciate it. No, he’s been wrong on a lot. He’s a nice man, though. He’s been wrong on a lot. “Do not, under any circumstances, wear a mask,” he said. “Do not close up to China,” he said. Then he said later on that President Trump saved tens of thousands of lives because I closed early. But how about this? How about Sleepy Joe? I close and he calls me xenophobic. I said, “Give me a definition of that, Joe. Give me a definition.” He didn’t know how. He had no idea what it meant.(21:10)
You know, 25 years ago, he was not smart. He was never considered smart, and now he’s considered about half of that. This is not what you want for your president. We’re doing too well. Our country’s doing too well. We will mass-distribute the vaccine in just a few weeks. We have all the vaccines. It’s all set. Our military is going to deliver. They’re going to take care of our seniors first. Is it okay if we take care of our seniors first? (21:46)
You know, I got it. I knew you didn’t hear this story, but I got it, because I got better quickly, but I got it. The First Lady got it, and a very young, tall person, 14 years old, named Barron Trump, got it. And I got better. They gave me something called Regeneron, but I’m sure I didn’t need it, because I am a perfect physical specimen and I’m very young. I’m very young. Perfect physical specimen. You know, I said that a little sarcastically, and I said … Although I actually think I am. No, I’m only kidding. No, I said that sarcastically. CNN, right over there with the red light, just went off. Any time I mention them, that light goes off. We have to cut to a commercial. You know, in one way, they need the ratings because they don’t get good ratings. (22:54)
No, they hated it when I said it. They said, “He is not a perfect physical specimen. It’s a disgrace. He’s lying to the American public, and he is not young. He is not young.” They went crazy. They went totally crazy. They went crazy. They spent two days on that one.(23:13)
Joe Biden, well, he’s very threatening all the time. He’s so agitated. Did you see him today with the glasses, the whole deal? But you don’t see the bad surgery. I put on those … What do they call them? Aviators? But they’re too small. They got to be bigger, right? They’re mirrored. You don’t see anything going through it. No, he’s very agitated, so angry. Everything’s screaming and shouting. It’s like crazy. But he’s a weak person. You know, he challenged me. Do you remember? A year-and-a-half ago? “Oh, I’d like to take him behind the barn.” And I said, “You know … ” I said, “Of all the people in the world that I could fight, that’s probably the one I’d like to most fight.”(24:06)
Those legs have gotten very thin, not a lot of base. You wouldn’t have to close the fist. And by the way, he brings it up. You know, when he brings it up, the press says nothing. If I ever said, “I’d like to take him behind the barn and beat the crap out of him,” you know what? They would say, “Our president is inciting evil.” I’m inciting. Every time you shout, “Lock him up,” or every time … Did you see the cars today? All over the place. Cars, trucks, and boats, all organic. They just formed, 5,000 boats. They have tractors in Iowa, thousands and thousands of tractors in this massive farm. They came from all over farm country. They had the thing with these … Really, I’d say very good people.(25:01)
They were riding along the highway, and you had Sleepy Joe’s bus. So they escorted the bus, and the radical left said, “Oh, what a horrible thing that is to escort the bus.” They don’t tell you about Antifa that go around burning down your cities. Democrat-run, only Democrat-run. (25:21)
They don’t talk about that, bopping people over the head, killing people, setting everything on fire. They don’t tell you about that. They tell you about people that are driving down a highway with an American flag and a Trump flag. Don’t worry; they’ll be just fine. They are going to be just fine. If they’re watching, I guess they were in Texas, right? Oh, Texas will be just fine. We’re doing great in Texas, by the way, really good. You know how? Is this the greatest? You know, I’ve had really six of these, because I had them here, but let’s say five, okay? Do you know what it is to do five of these? I start early in the morning. No, think of it. Start early in the morning, but you know what’s the nice part about this one? This is the last one of the day, so we can stay all night. (26:16)
All night. I was rushing. I was rushing. They said, “You’re going to be late for Florida, Sir.” I said, “How much?” “About an hour-and-a-half.” “Oh, that’s not so bad.” I hope everyone’s having… You know how many people we lost? I’d say zero. We actually gained. People heard about it. They said, “Let’s go.” No, it’s great to be with you. It’s great. Tomorrow, I have five more. Can you imagine five? Five. Five more, and then normally, they’d say, “Five more and let’s crash,” but I don’t know if I can crash. I think it’s going to be a very exciting day. Tuesday is going to be a very exciting day. Make sure you get out. Tuesday is going to be a very exciting day. The most exciting day in the history of television was four years ago, right? (27:20)
Thank you. No, but it is nice that we can take our time. I can tell you stories about some of the things that happen in government. You don’t want to hear them. You wouldn’t even believe them, the level of stupidity, the things that we saved. Like we saved a couple of billion dollars on the embassy in Israel. We built it for slightly less. We built it for slightly less. First, I picked the site that we already owned. You know, that’s better than paying millions for a site, but I picked one that was a better location, bigger, better. Then they were going to build the building for anywhere between one billion and two. This is like a two-storey building, right? One billion and 2 billion, and we built it for $500,000, a slight saving.(28:08)
We had an existing building that we fixed up. We used Jerusalem stone, very expensive when you bring it to New York or Washington. But when you’re building in Jerusalem, it’s a very cheap material. I said, “Use Jerusalem stone. It’s great stuff.” And we opened it for $500,000, instead of two billion dollars. That’s one of many. We could tell you about them all night, but let’s get back to the point.(28:34)
Isn’t it nice when you have a president that doesn’t need a teleprompter? You have a president … It is a nice thing. I had a couple today, though. It was so windy. It was so unbelievable windy, you wouldn’t have believed that the teleprompters were going like this. And then I finally gave up on the teleprompter, so we just talked for an hour and 20 minutes. I said, “This is not possible to read those things, going, “Wah.” You know, the winds were like 30 to 40. The press knows. They couldn’t hold onto the camera. That was a positive event. They know. They never saw. It was probably minus something, if you talk about wind chill. I think it was 30 degrees with a 30-mile-an-hour wind, and it was blowing right in my face. These people that set this up …(29:21)
It was blowing so hard, and I had a whole section on illegal immigrants pouring into our country, and I left it out, because I said, “If they would have had to suffer the cold weather that I was, they would never come in. They would have stayed. They would have stayed right where they came from.” They had some rough … We had three. The first three were freezing. So I go from freezing, and today was like 98 degrees. I said, “How warm is it?” “Sir, it’s about 97 degrees.” This is wonderful for not catching pneumonia.(29:58)
Biden’s cruel lockdown would be especially devastating for Florida’s tourism and hospitality workers, for the services industry, and for millions of Latinos in Florida, Arizona, and Nevada, and all across the country. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life, then you have no choice but to cast your vote for a person named President Trump. It’s very true.(30:35)
But I don’t have to talk too much about Sleepy Joe, because I spent a fortune today to give you a beautiful … Look at the size of that screen that we put up. Where do you have two? You have two of them. This must be Florida. Look at that. You have two of them. Take a look. Here’s a video. Roll it. (34:14)
Thank you. I don’t even have to say … I could say, goodnight, everybody. That can not be your president. The Biden lockdown would cripple Florida. My plan will lift Florida to record highs, we’ve already been doing it. So joining us tonight, we have some wonderful people. You have a wonderful, great governor, loves your state and loves our country. Governor Ron DeSantis, Ron? A man who’s become a really good friend of mine. We went to war and he’s a tough guy, he’s a smart guy. But he really he’s doing a fantastic job for you and for everybody, Senator Marco Rubio.(35:27)
Good to see you, Marco. You have great senators. This is one that happened to be your governor also. And Ron would be the first one to say it, Rick Scott did a great job as governor doing a great job as your Senator, Rick Scott. Where is Rick? Thank you, Rick.(35:53)
And a great job on television today, Jeanette Nunez. Thank you very much, Jeanette. Wow, what a good job you did. What a job you did representing your state and said nice things about a lot of people. The only one I really cared about was me. So I was very happy. It did a great job today. Thank you very much, Jeanette.(36:14)
Chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis Jimmy. Thank you. Thank you, Jimmy. Great. Doing great, Jimmy. And we have some warriors with us, real warriors, Mario Diaz Balart, Congressman. Thank you Mario. Fantastic job. Fantastic job. He’s become a friend of mine. He had the China plague and he got better pretty quick, right? Got better quick. And now he’s immune. Until I came along, they said, “If you’re immune you’re immune for life, everybody’s immune.” When I got it, I said I was immune. They said, “Yeah, but it’s only for four months now.” Mario, they only now give us four months, okay? What a terrible thing. I’m sorry I did that to all of those people.(37:04)
And another warrior, tough guy, smart guy. And really my friend, Brian Mast. Thank you, Brian. Congressional candidates, they’re fantastic. Byron Donalds. Where is Byron? You are doing great, Byron. You are doing great. Good job. Fantastic job. And another man, I’ve known him for a long time, he’s terrific. He’s going to win he’s up in the polls by the way, Carlos Jiminez. Where is he? Carlos. Thank you, Carlos. Good job.(38:01)
And the next mayor of Miami Dade County, Steve Bovo. Hey, you’re a popular guy, Steve. You’re a popular guy. (38:32)
Former attorney general and a fantastic talent and my friend for a long time. Oh, we’re going to look for something for her. She had to go out and make a couple of bucks and I’m sure she’s doing great. She’s always done great, and she was an incredible representative of your state, a very special woman, Pam Bondi. Pam, great. You’re doing a great job. Great person. Another great person. She was so tough in California. She was the DA, right? The DA. And she was brutal. I think she’s like 471 to nothing. You never wanted to get in trouble with this one. And she’s a very special person to me and to my family. Kimberly Guilfoyle And I have respect for champions. There’s a reason you’re a champion. And whether it’s Jack Nicklaus, who gave us a beautiful endorsement the other day. So many champions, right? Actually, not too many champions. Usually they tend to choke in the end. In the end, they’re not champions, but we have one of the greatest fighters anywhere in the world. In fact, I was willing before, when there was a little trouble back there, I was willing to pit whoever that poor person was against the greatest fighter, Jorge Masvidal. The greatest.(40:13)
I went to a UFC fight. I went to a UFC fight and this gentleman, and he is a gentleman. Great guy, actually, hard to believe. How the hell are you such a nice guy? I have a feeling I don’t know. He was fighting a young superstar, right? He was a young, handsome guy. Really good looking guy. Maybe that was the problem with him, he looked too good. And I was Dana White, the great Dana White. You know who Dana White is, what a job. And he said, “Let me tell you something, Jorge has been around for a little while.” He’s won most of his fights. I hear he’s got a very big one coming up. I’ll be watching that one. I’m going to be watching it, he’s a fantastic talent.(40:59)
He fought as a very young guy. Used to fight at eight years old, had beat up people that are 16 and 17. And then one day they said, “Let’s take this guy to the gym.” And you know what? He beat up all these guys in the gym. And he’s a total champion. He’s a total champion, and I do want to take that bet. Is that person still here? No, he went back home to mom? Went back home to mom. But we had this young, handsome, really, he looked like a male model. And Dana white said to me, “This is the future of the UFC. Watch how great he is. He’s tremendous.” And wasn’t he like 12 and 0, and he walked in the ring and he was full of stuff. And this guy walks in and the fight lasted. What was it? One and a half seconds, I think. Five seconds. It was the quickest knockout in the history of the UFC.(41:56)
No, it was like, ding. He runs across the ring, kicks the hell out of him, right in the face. And I looked at Dana. I said, “Dana, what happened? What happened?” He’s a great fighter. And he’s a great guy. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. Champ, he’s a champ. He’s got that heart. He’s got that heart. Thank you, man. We need more people like him, I can tell you. We need people like him in our government that have guts and courage and smarts too.(42:27)
For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars, rebuilding foreign nations, fighting ridiculous foreign wars and defending our foreign borders that we didn’t defend our own borders. But now we do. And now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong. It’s enough.(42:57)
For 47 years. Sleepy, Joe Biden, betrayed Hispanic Americans. I’m not going to let you meet him, champ, you may get angry. That’d be one 10th of one second. Now he wants to close your small businesses, eliminate school choice and attack our Hispanic law enforcement heroes at the border, you know that. The radical left will assault Catholic organizations, ban prayer in school and fund extreme late term abortion. I will always stand with the incredible Hispanic American community, you know that.(43:44)
Well, that’s one of the things that’s going wrong with the vote. I’ll tell you. You’ve been here so long that some of you have been here since like yesterday. I know you’ve been on line. But you’ve been here a long time, but I’ll tell you, so one of the problems with Florida for the other side for sleepy, Joe and the Democrats is that they say, “What happened? The Hispanic Americans are not voting. They’re not coming out for sleepy Joe?” Who the hell can vote for this guy? They’re saying that’s one, right? The other one is the black community. What’s going on? They’re voting for Trump. They’re voting for Trump. Look at you. They’re voting for Trump.(44:25)
They’re voting for Trump. Did you see it, 18%? The old days, they’d get 4%. You want 4%, you needed 4%. 18 or 19%, I think it’s going up to 20%, whatever it is, it’s about three times what anyone’s gotten. Thank you very much. Thank you to the black community. Thank you to the Hispanic community. And we’re returning the pharmaceutical industry back to Puerto Rico. Biden is the one that took it out. So I don’t know if we have anybody from Puerto Rico. Do we have Puerto Rico? Puerto Rico? Yes. We’re bringing those jobs back. That was Biden. Oh, that’s right. Oh yes. We’re bringing the pharmaceutical industry back. It was doing great and then Biden and his group of clowns, they didn’t know what the hell they were doing. They moved it. You know where it moved to? China. We’re bringing it all back.(45:27)
Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure Southern border in the history of the United States. And the wall right now, it’s over 400 miles. It’ll be finished very shortly. And it’s everything that the border patrol, I listened to them. They wanted steel, concrete, and rebar. I said, “What about just concrete plank?” “Sir, we want it this way.” I said, “Okay, I’ll do it.” I don’t want to give them any excuses. But it’s incredible what’s happened with that and we have the most secure border we’ve ever had. And by the way, we want people to come into our country, but we want them to come in on merit and we want them to come in legally and that’s what happens. That’s what we’re doing. We want them to come in. We need people to come in because of the jobs, we need people. The Biden Kamala plan. How about when she introduced herself? And they said the Harris, the Harris-Biden administration, and then Joe Biden said the same thing two hours later. He said, “Under the Harris-Biden administration.” This is twice in one day.(46:37)
I love Mike Pence. I think he’s great, don’t we? But I have a deal with Mike. I said, “Mike, I will never say it’s the Pence-Trump administration.” But Mike has done a great job. He’s done a great job. He’s done a great job with NASA. NASA, the space center, we have done a great job with that. Mike has led it. The Biden- Harris plan would increase refugees from terrorist regions by a staggering 700%, including from Syria, Somalia, and Yemen. And I am keeping radical Islamic terrorists out of our country, if you don’t mind.(47:18)
We’re keeping them the hell out. If you don’t mind, if Florida doesn’t mind, we will. I put a ban on, everyone told me what a horrible thing to do. Ask France, whether or not that would be a good thing for them. Have you seen what’s happened in France over the last week? No, thank you. We want people to come into our country who love our country.(47:43)
For instance, we’re going to win Minnesota. You know one of the reasons why? Ilhan Omar, She loves our country very much. She loves our country. It’s unbelievable. Yeah.(48:01)
Yeah. Yeah. She loves us very much. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military, the most ever. And you know what? I said, we got to break the budget for this one, because all built in the USA. We have the best missiles, the best rockets, the best fighter jets, have 35, submarines, nobody even close to us, we have submarine technology that nobody’s even close. We have things that nobody, we are the envy of the world militarily. And when I took it over, it was a depleted, broken military. One of the most overrated generals anywhere in the history of this country came up to me and said, sir, we have no ammunition. This was my first week in office. I was getting a little bit frisky with a certain country. You know that right? You all know about it. And he came and he said, sir, we have no ammunition. I became much less frisky with that contract. I said, it will have to wait.(49:01)
Now we have so much ammunition, we don’t know what the hell to do with it, okay. We also passed VA choice and VA accountability for our great vets. Right? Right? Yeah. They said it couldn’t be done. Just got a 91% approval rating from our vets, the highest by far that we’ve ever had. At my direction, the United States military conducted a successful operation to rescue an American hostage kidnapped overseas just 96 hours ago. Last night… He was kidnapped 96 hours ago, we went in last night, the US special forces, brilliantly executed a daring, nighttime operation. [inaudible 00:49:56] They wanted to do it so badly. [inaudible 00:02:01].(50:06)
They kidnap this young, in a far away land. They kidnap this young American, kidnapped him and they were negotiating for a, they wanted money. Once you give money, once you do that, you’ll have it hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times. So we had some people that are the best in the world. These are the best fighters in the world, except for him, maybe. I don’t know, different kind of fighting, right? Different, different kind of fighting right? But these are the best in the world. Incredible people, smart, brilliant in so many ways, and great. They wanted to do it. I said, do they want to do it? You couldn’t hold them back.(50:45)
And they went in there and they went in by night and it was over very quickly. And we didn’t have anybody even injured slightly. We got the hostage and unfortunately they are gone. They are gone. Now, if you pay them, they’ll be doing just over and over. So I’d like, it would be wonderful, let’s say, but once you do that, even if it was a small amount, it’s no good. And they didn’t want a small amount. They wanted a lot of money. Over the last four years, we’ve rescued a record 55 hostages and detainees in more than 24 countries. And some of them were very tough countries, but we were able to get them out. That’s a lot. That’s a record too. And what do we have?(51:33)
Robert O’Brien, is he around here? He’s fantastic. Where’s Robert? Where is Robert? He is so good. What happened to him? He’s out negotiating a hostage deal. That’s all he does. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? Robert, look at him. I’ll tell you. He’s a little, he’s a little tired. This is his fifth rally today too. He’s fantastic. He’s fantastic. What a job he does. Thank you, Robert. Great job too. Congratulations. That was brave. I said, Robert, do you want to do it? It was like, yes before I finished the question. You want to do it, Robert? Yes. So anyway, good job. Thank you very much.(52:21)
The operation should serve as a stark warning to terrorists and thugs who try to kidnap our people. You cannot escape the long reach of our American military or American justice. You can’t do it. We obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate and it was a mess. Let me tell you, when I took over, it was a mess. It was all over the place. It’s gone, 100%. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. They were looking for him for 14, first day in office, I said to our people, great people. I said, where’s al-Baghdadi? That’s all I heard about, al-Bag, every time I’d say where’s al-Baghdadi. And one day they came in, they said, we have him, sir, what do you want us to do? I said, I’ll tell you what, let’s go. And we got a bad, bad guy, founded ISIS. And he was trying to rebuild it again. We eliminated the mass murderer of us troops, and many troops and many people. Soleimani is dead.(53:29)
I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. Iran is not doing well. They had a 27% GDP decline. It was like the opposite with all the sanctions. I’ll tell you the first call I get, if we win, we got to win. First call I get will be from the Supreme Leader, as he calls himself, the Supreme Leader. I refuse to call him the Supreme Leader, but he calls himself the Supreme Leader. The first call will be from the Supreme Leader. And you know what? I’d love to make a deal with him. You know why? We don’t want to do anything bad, but we just can’t let them have a nuclear weapon, if that’s okay. Can’t let them have.(54:10)
Obama paid him $150 billion, 150 billion, 150 million would be a lot, but 150 billion. It’s not even, it’s not even conceived. This is people that don’t have any clue about life. Gave him 1.8 billion in cash, in green. Can you believe it? Cash. Five plane loads, big planes. Exactly, where is that beautiful plane that we came in? Where the hell is it? Oops. Somebody stole Air Force One. Planes like that. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they’ve been negotiating. People would fly in, fly out, fly in, fly out, have dinner, have lunch, fly in, fly out. 52 years. I did it in two hours, a little bit less.(55:09)
And instead of endless war, we are now forging peace in the Middle East. We have the countries aligned, [inaudible 00:07:18]. No blood in the sand, no costs, no nothing. They want, you know what? After all these years, frankly, we just said, what did Obama do? And I heard, and you know what I did? I did the opposite. I said, what did Obama do? And then I did the opposite, and it worked. Biden and Barack Hussein Obama made a pathetic one-sided deal with the Castro regime on Cuba. That was the other thing I did. I said, who made the deal? Obama. I said, we’re going to go the exact opposite way. Okay. We only have a 96% approval rating with Cuban Americans, 96. 96%. Who the hell are the 4%? Champ, who are the 4%?(56:15)
Now the Biden campaign has said that they will work closely with socialistic dictator Maduro in Venezuela. Not the way you do it. My opponent embraces socialists and communists because he has no choice, because that’s who he’s dealing with in government. I stand with the proud people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, in their righteous struggle for freedom. And we’re making a lot of progress. A vote for me is, we are making, by the way, we’re making a lot of progress. A vote for me in the Republican party is a vote for the American dream. That’s what it is. So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all, it’s already started. We will expand opportunity zones, increase vocational education, and provide school choice to every family in America. We will hire more police. Increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Your second amendment. [inaudible 00:58:08]. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we’re doing. We will end surprise medical billing. Require price transparency, lower drug prices to the lowest levels they’ve ever gone. And we will always protect patients with pre existing condition. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars very soon. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust.(59:24)
For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great, incredible, wonderful people of Florida. You better vote, vote, vote, vote. Two days from now, America’s fate is in your hands. And as I said, we win Florida. We win it all. Your vote can defeat the Washington swamp. We’ve done a good job of it, but it’s deeper and more vicious than we ever thought. And the corrupt media right there, once and for all. So you must get out and vote. We have never had in the history of our country, I really believe this, a more important election. We will never, ever be, [inaudible 01:00:19] wants to start a conversation with me. Can you believe? That’s okay, darling. Yes?:00:24)
[inaudible 01:00:25].(01:00:24)
Oh, good. Joan Miller from the Brooklyn Club. Hi, Joan. Joan, let me finish up. Joan, thank you very much. From Tampa to Tallahassee, from Orlando to Jacksonville, and from Pensacola to Miami, we inherit the legacy of American Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come.(01:01:23)
Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Florida, we have made America powerful again, our military. We have made America wealthy again, wealthy, wealthy, wealthy. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Florida. Go out and vote. Thank you."

Wow. This is a big crowd. This is a very big crowd. Look at all those cameras over there. Can you show the crowd? Can you show this crowd? They never talk about a crowd. And in reverse, they never talk about Sleepy Joe’s crowd either. It’s about 12 people just showed up. 12. Look at this crowd. Maybe you could take those cameras to just show over there and over there. This is great. Hello, Pennsylvania. Hello, Pennsylvania. We love Pennsylvania. Great education. And also, hello, Reading. We know it well. We know it well. Three days from now, we are going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we are going to win four more great years in the White House.(06:39)
I will tell you they’re getting a little nervous back there, the Fake News, because Florida is looking very strong. And these are not suppression polls. These are voters they’re coming in. Florida is looking very good. North Carolina is looking very good. Ohio is looking beyond good. Ohio. You never hear, “You can’t win unless you win the great state of Ohio.” Did you ever hear that? Well, Ohio is looking real good. They’re all looking good. You know what’s looking good? Pennsylvania is looking good. Real good. That great red wave is going to be very beautiful to watch. We’re looking good. And if we win Pennsylvania, it’s over. It’s over. But be careful. You’ve got big tech. You have the Democrats and they play dirty. You have the RINOs. The RINOs are not good people. You’ve got them all.(07:45)
But we’re here and you have your Second Amendment. You have your tax cuts. You have your regulation cuts. You have your fracking. You have your fracking. How about Joe? He goes for a year, “There will be no fracking. I tell you, there will be no fracking.” He comes to Pennsylvania, listen, we have a million jobs for fracking. We like $2 gasoline. It’s nice, isn’t it? We’ve got a lot of things. “Well, in that case, let me just change my …” And he never even gets asked about it by the fake news. Can you believe it? With your support, we will continue to bring back your jobs, cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful term, “Made in the U.S.A.” And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You see it’s already going. You saw what happened. You saw those numbers come out. You have to look very closely.(08:44)
A man got on television yesterday and said, “This is probably the greatest economic day in the history of our country,” and the papers barely even put it in. It’s called suppression, suppression. And Joe Biden will shut down your economy. Well, you’re already shut down in Pennsylvania. Hey Governor, you’ve got to open up. You’ve got to open up the state, Governor. You’ve to open it up. And don’t cheat in the ballots, Governor. Don’t cheat. Don’t cheat. We’re going to win. We’re going to win. The only way we can lose this state and the numbers are in, you see what’s going on, somebody’s going to play games. And they just got an extension. What’s the extension all about? Wouldn’t you like to hear, “November 3rd, we win. We lose. We win. We lose. Whatever.” November 3rd, now you have more time, more time. What’s going on? That was a very disappointing opinion, but I’ve had many disappointing opinions from the Supreme Court. I will tell you. Many, many disappointing opinions from the Supreme Court. They talk about we control the Supreme Court. We don’t control the Supreme Court. That was a terrible decision.(09:53)
Joe Biden will shut down your economy, wipe out your factories, and shut down your state. Ship your jobs to China. Raise your taxes $4 trillion. The biggest tax increase in the history of our country. And I gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of it. He’ll eliminate your private healthcare. 180 million people have the best healthcare. They work so hard and they negotiated with many great companies and have the best healthcare. They want to knock it out. They want you to live on socialized medicine. I don’t think you’ll be too happy. “Darling, I have a call.” “Oh. Go to the hospital room.” You’ll wait in line for about four days. That’ll be nicer, right? And send your state into a deep and catastrophic depression.(10:49)
And if you look at the stock market, we’ve done great. The only headwind in the stock market, it’s an election, things can happen. We’re doing great. Much better than anyone understands. They’re starting to get very depressed. You talk about a depression. They’re having a hard time. They’re having a hard time with it. But you know what? There’s a headwind. Do you know what the headwind is? That there’s a possibility if Biden wins you’re going to have a stock market collapse the likes of which you’ve never had. You will have a collapse. So that’s our headwind. If we win, if we win on Tuesday, or thank you very much, Supreme Court shortly thereafter, if we win, let me tell you, if we win, you’re going to see a stock market that’s going to go like a rocket ship. 401ks, your 401Ks. (11:40)
Thank you. (11:40)
Thank you. (11:57)
This is a very enthusiastic group, isn’t it? This is great. Wow. This doesn’t seem like someone who’s going to come in second, do you agree? I don’t think so. Did you see Biden and Obama before, they made a thing? Honk, honk. Honk. Honk, honk. And actually most of them are our supporters trying to cause a little havoc, but that’s all right. We don’t want that. Biden has vowed to abolish the entire U.S. oil industry. No more fracking, no mining, no heating, no clean coal, and gas prices going up at $5, 6$, and $7 a gallon. So when you pull in with your car, you say, “Darling, I think we’re going to sell this beautiful SUV. Let’s get a compact.” Do you remember the compacts? “The gas is too expensive. What has this guy Biden done?” And the bad part is that Biden doesn’t have a clue. He’s gonzo. We all know it. They just don’t want to say it.(13:22)
Biden’s plan, I don’t think he likes me too much, is an economic death sentence for this great commonwealth. It’s a death sentence. He’ll eradicate your economy. Kamala Harris. Did you ever hear of Kamala? You have to pronounce it Kamala. She makes Bernie Sanders look like a strict conservative. Do you know that? Bernie is a conservative member compared to her. I mean, how that choice was made. And did our great Vice President win that debate easily? That was a big one. Mike is doing a great job. The most liberal Senator even sponsored the Green New Deal, $100 trillion. It started off at 100 trillion then 106. Now they have it down to six trillion. No, it’s not six trillion. And by the way, if it was, you couldn’t afford it. But you can afford 100.(14:18)
A vote for Biden and Harris is a vote to ban, and you know this, ban fracking, ban mining, close up your individual plants. They’ve got plants all over the place. I grew up here. They have plants all over. When I say grew up, let me be exact, during college, because they’ll say, “He misrepresented. He said he grew up.” But Biden represents it. “This is my home.” This is not his home. They left. They abandoned you. It wasn’t his fault. He was nine years old or something. It was not his fault. But it’s not like he’s a big Pennsylvania guy. No, he’s a Delaware guy. And Delaware is a good place. In fact, it’s really good. He likes it so much he never leaves. He never leaves. He made the mistake. He came to Pennsylvania three days ago, because I was here. I was doing three of them. Three in Pennsylvania. Hey, I’m devoting a lot of my percentage of time to Pennsylvania. What do you think? I must like you.(15:18)
No, we win Pennsylvania. We’re going to win Florida. If we win Pennsylvania, it’s over. Let’s do it. I felt very badly, I felt guilty, because if you remember four years ago, we were at 98% of the vote. If I lost every single vote, there were X number of votes left, if I lost every single vote, every vote, take them all, I still win. They refused to call it. They refused. They wouldn’t call it. I said, “Wait a minute. They have to call it.” Because I was at 98, not 99, I was at 98. It stood there for an hour and a half. And I kept saying, “That’d be nice, Pennsylvania. That’d be nice.” They refused. And then they said, ” Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin.” And then they said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan.” And we won. And then much later, they just refused to give you the credit. So let’s turn it around on them, okay? They didn’t treat you.(16:21)
I kept waiting. I said, “Look at Pennsylvania. Why aren’t they going to call it? Why?” They waited for hours and hours. I said, “I’ll concede every vote. I’ll concede every one and we win.” They wouldn’t do that. But we won it, and we won it pretty easily. I think we want it pretty easily. And what I’ve done from the time we won and what I’ve done since then, what we’ve done for this state has been incredible, or to be perfectly accurate. For this commonwealth. But what we’ve done for Pennsylvania has been incredible. You had the best year you’ve ever had last year and you’re heading to the best year you’ve ever had period, and it’s going to be this coming year. Biden would completely destroy Pennsylvania. A vote for me is a vote to remain energy independent. Do you believe it? We can say that. Did you ever think you’re going to hear those beautiful words? We’re energy independent.(17:16)
Our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded. That was what was announced yesterday. The only problem is, a very, very brilliant gentleman called me up. Not a nice man at all. In fact, he’s ruthless and vicious. I love that guy with the beard back there. He goes to a number. Thank you. He’s so distinguished. He’s so distinguished. I see him at so many rallies. I appreciate it. I think he’s great. He’s going, “Four more years.” Yeah. He’s great. But you know what? He got up and he said, very smart, very successful guy, he said, “This could be the biggest announcement in 50 years. 33.1% GDP.” That’s growth. He said it broke the record. It’s the number one in history, of the history of our country.(18:03)
… it broke the record, it’s the number one in history, in the history of our country, and probably the history of any country, if you want to know the truth. But 33.1% which is far greater than people were anticipating, anybody. So what happens is that this is the biggest announcement but you watch, they won’t give you any credit, they’ll try not to mention. It’s true, the press is playing it down so much. Just like for different reasons they refuse to talk, they refuse to talk about where’s Hunter. They refuse to talk about the corruption in Biden’s family. We’ve learned more about the fake news, but this is no longer fake news, this is now corrupt news. This is now corrupt news. We’ve learned a lot. But we had the greatest number we’ve ever had.(18:52)
I thought I heard that from over there. See, I don’t participate in this because look at all the cameras back there, look at them all. You know what they’re going to do? “He’s trying to incite them.” No, I don’t have to incite them, they’re like intelligent people, they know. They know that when you get thrown out of the military and you have no job for a long time, and then your father becomes Vice President, and then you get $183,000, right? $183,000 to sit on a board, probably never went to a board meeting, and supposedly 3 million upfront. And then the mayor of Moscow’s wife gives you a check for 3.5 million, and then… And then, you go in Air Force Two and you go to a very nice place known as China, that should have never, ever done what they did. They should have never done. We just signed a great trade deal and the ink wasn’t dry, and the plague came in. They should have, they could have stopped it.(19:57)
But they go to China, father and son goes to China, and he walks out with $1.5 billion to manage, which is millions of dollars a year. And then he goes for the big play, 10 million a year, you saw that one? He wants 10 million a year. This is a guy didn’t have a job a year before. Goes to China, “We want 10 million a year for introductory,” in other words, he’ll introduce people to his father. And then you see his father, the big guy, the big guy, they call him, he’s not a big guy. He’s not a big guy… He’s not a big guy. No.(20:34)
Do you remember like a year ago, year and a half ago, he said, “I’d like to take him to the back of the barn…” A slight slap. You don’t have to close… you didn’t close your fist. Now they said, “He’s inciting violence.” No, no. But when Biden… I thought it was a terrible… Remember that he actually like, “I want to take him to the back of the barn.” They didn’t say the thing. If I said that, they’d say this is a terrible human being, right? It’s all right.(21:15)
You know what? In the meantime we have the White House, right? We have the White House. We have the presidency. We have fracking. We have energy. We have manufacturing that they totally gave up. Remember, you’d need a magic wand. In the past five months, we’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs, there’s never been that many jobs produced in that short a period of time. While foreign nations are in a free fall, and they are, unfortunately, I feel badly for them, but they are. We are creating the world’s greatest economic powerhouse. We are going to be more powerful than ever before. We had to stop. We had to close. We saved 2 million lives. Remember they, they don’t want to ever talk about that. The model was 2.2 million. That’s what they said. We saved 2 million lives, we closed it up. How would you like to be, ma’am, sitting there, we have the greatest economy of the history of this country, in the history of the world.(22:12)
We were doing so much better than China, I was throwing tariffs on them, they were paying us billion dollars. I gave $28 billion to farmers because they were targeted by China. Iowa, Nebraska, they’ll remember, they’ll remember. I gave them 28 billion with a B, farmers, farms, and ranchers because they were targeted by China because they thought China thought they could use the farmers to get the deal that they want because I said, “I’m not going to let you rip off the United States, you’ve done it long enough, for years and years.” And I’m not just talking about Obama. I’m talking about other presidents too, they allowed this to happen. They allowed this to happen. So we gave our farmers 28 billion, that’s not… all from China. I said, “Please write a letter, say thank you very much, President Xi.” A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under… Think of that. And that’s during, we’re rounding the turn, they hate when I say it. You know we’re coming up with the vaccines, the therapeutics are incredible. Here I am, I mean, you know. I’m sure I would have been here without the therapeutic because as you can see I’m in perfect physical shape and I’m extremely young. So I’m young and I’m a perfect physical specimen… No, so I’m sure I could have beat it without… But something happened when I took that sucker and it was gone. It was gone. I woke up the next morning and I ripped off my shirt. I said, “Doctor, let me the hell out of here.”(23:56)
And I was campaigning like… very… Oh, the other side, were they happy? Oh, were they happy? But you know what? When you’re President of the United States, you can’t lock yourself into a basement at the White House. Got to be President and meet people, right? I can’t lock myself into the basement, and they have a very good basement, I can’t lock myself into a beautiful bedroom and stay there for a year and a half. The President of the United States is locked in the most magnificent bedroom on the third floor of the White House because we have a pandemic and he’s afraid to go out, he’s your President. No, no, you got to go out.(24:35)
And the doctor came up to me. Great doctors. One thing if you’re President you get good doctors, that’s the one thing I can tell, and you get plenty of them too, they got more doctors. But they came up, “Sir, you’re positive, you just tested positive.” I said, “Doctor, tell me something. For what?” “Sir, you have the China plague.” He didn’t say that, he said, “COVID, sir.” COVID, you know it’s got about 24 different names, most of them should start with the word China because that’s where it came from. They have a word corona, right? The coronavirus. Well, I say what is this a place in Italy? Sounds like an island in Italy. Corona. No, I don’t want it, it’s the China, it’s the China virus, that’s what it is.(25:21)
But he said, “Sir, you just tested positive for COVID.” I said, “Ugh, that’s great. Wait a minute, I got about four campaign stops to make in the next couple of days because we got to win this, this is the most important election in the history of our country.” And then our great First Lady tested positive. Well, at least those rumors that we don’t live together turned out to be false. She lives in a house someplace in Virginia. No. No. She lives with me and she tested… I said, “That’s the only good thing about her testing positive because…” But she’s strong and knocked it out. But then they said, you know that they said, “Sir, Barron,” now, Barron’s my 14-year old boy who’s very tall and strong, he’s very strong, all right? And Barron, they said, “Sir, Baron tested positive.” I said, “Huh, that’s not good.” About 12 minutes later, I said, “How’s Barron doing?” “Sir, he’s shed it, no problem, he’s fine.” Get back to school, Governor, tell them they have to get back to school. Got to get back to school. Those young kids they have that strong, we feel strong, they have that very strong immune system. “How is he?” “He’s 100%.” “Barron, was it bad?” “I don’t think I had anything wrong, Dad.” That’s one of those things, right? That’s the way it is. They’re young and they’re strong and their immune system is good and they should go back to school immediately. Sleepy Joe Biden is a diehard globalist who spent the last 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that most of you have never even heard of before. They’re all coming back to soldiers are coming back, you know that. 19 years. So now 19 years and they were policemen, they policed areas, but it’s ridiculous what they were doing in this country. Ridiculous. Biden is a Washington vulture who decimated your steel mills, annihilated your coal jobs, clean coal, and supported every disaster sellout trade deal for over half a century. I mean, I know it’s the reason why I’m President.(27:48)
The real thing that bothered me more than anything else, I thought the wars were crazy. I thought so much was bad, but I saw these trade deals we were making with countries, both ally, and foe, and our allies in many ways treated us worse than the foe, okay. We were treated horribly on trade and we were treated horribly on the military. We had to pay for their military. By the way, those days have ended very substantially you know. Very, very substantially.(28:17)
Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever made, maybe the worst, and China’s entry into the world trade organization. That’s where China was flat-lined for years and years and then they went up like a rocket ship. You know they’re considered a developing nation. As a developing nation, they get a much better deal than we do. I said, “China is not a developing nation. Or you can let them be, then we’re a developing nation also.” When you think of it, we are a developing nation. And then we won $7.5 billion recently, we hadn’t won anything because the judges within the world trade, the judges treated us with disrespect. But with me, they’re respected because I’ll say, “We’ll pull the hell out of there. We’ll pull out.” And we won 7.5 billion, all of a sudden we’re winning cases.(29:06)
I wish our Supreme Court treated us as well, frankly. That was some decision that was made, right? Let’s not, let’s not listen to the decision, this most important election in the history of our country, November 3rd. Let’s not wait November 3rd, let’s extend the date. Let’s give people more time to put in ballots, right? Why can’t they put their ballots in earlier so you have plenty of time, and so we can have a decision on November 3rd, the evening of November 3rd? And you know what’s going to happen? Especially with Pennsylvania, man was on television yesterday, “We allow five points for cheating,” he said in Pennsylvania, right? Think of that. One of the best pollsters in the country? The one who got it right four years ago. He said, “Trump’s going to win Pennsylvania but you have to allow five points for cheating.” You know when the cheating is going to take place? From the 3rd to whatever the date is that they gave. No, that’s very disappointing. That was a very political decision, I have to say, they have not treated me.(30:10)
Pennsylvania lost half of its manufacturing jobs to these calamities of Sleepy Joe Biden. How do you like his new sunglasses? You like them? That’s so you don’t see the bad surgery on the eyes. No, they’re terrible, those… They got to get a little… If you going to use that kind, what are they? Aviation, right? He’s got to go at least one or two sizes larger that don’t look like… I don’t like it. I don’t know, he’s got the silver deal going, the whole deal. And he’s very angry, right? You ever notice? You know what, the word is a… It’s agitated. You know why he’s agitated, right? Because he’s got a problem. “We’ve got to…” And you just hope he can keep it going, but it’s not going to go much longer. That’s why crazy Nancy was trying to get the 25th amendment so if he ever got in, we’d get him out.(31:05)
And then you have Kamala, that should never be your first woman president. But based on the numbers, the way I look at them, in Pennsylvania I don’t think we’re going to have to worry about it too much, okay? And Florida and Ohio and lots of others. North Carolina is looking pretty good, did you see that? And this is no longer the fake suppression polls. You know we had a thing, Wisconsin is great and we won it last time, and we had a poll come out, I’m up one, then I’m down one, then I’m up one, then I’m even, you know what this is crazy stuff. But it’s, you know, it’s within this area.(31:45)
I think we doing much better than that, you know. I think, I think we’re way ahead. You know, I mean, I don’t know if I should be happy or sad, people say, “I don’t want to talk to you about it.” Then they go vote for Trump you know and we end up winning by a lot. But that’s what happened last time. They thought I was going to lose because everyone walking out the exit polls, they’d walk out. “Who are you voting for?” “None of your business.” Everybody that said, “None of your business,” they were Trump voters.(32:10)
Remember at five o’clock in the afternoon, they said, “Trump lost.” Well, they forgot to say, you know, they had the largest numbers of it’s called something else, but I’m trying to be nice because there’s so many young people here. It’s not “none of your business”, it’s a much better word. It’s two words that they say. But all those votes were votes for me. So they don’t count them. So they said, “Oh, it looks like it’s going to be a rough time for Trump.” And they were happy as hell. And then the votes came in. It was, that was a brutal evening for a lot of anchors that were crying. “I don’t know how this could have happened. Yes, I’m an impartial anchor. I’m an impartial, I go, how did this happen?” The tears are…(32:51)
At every turn, Biden twisted his knife into the backs of Pennsylvania workers. While Biden was giving China your jobs, his family was raking in millions of dollars from China, millions and millions of dollars. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, China will own the US. Just remember that. And with me, it went just the opposite. I will tell you one thing, I can name many countries that would like me to lose. You know they said that Germany, that in Germany, and I have a heritage with Germany, I mean they should like me, but they like Obama much better than they should like Obama. There’s no way they can like me. I said, “Pay up.” They don’t pay their, they’re delinquent in NATO. They owe us billions and billions of dollars. Obama never said, “Pay up.” I said, “You got to pay up otherwise we have to take our troops out.” And then I hear that they like him better, well they should. You know what? If they ever like me better, I’m not doing my job, okay?(33:53)
When we win, when America wins so we’re going to have winning like you’ve never seen before. In 2016 Pennsylvania voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as President who is finally putting America first. Is that okay, Pennsylvania? And you don’t have to take my word for it because on Biden’s record of economic treachery, and I only do this for places I like a lot. Thank you. They going to get it started. Is there any [crosstalk 00:34:37]- (34:40)
You said it on tape. (34:44)
I’ll put it on. (35:25)
Would he close down [crosstalk 00:35:25]- (35:31)
Oh, that’s a big statement [crosstalk 00:35:31]- (35:32)
In terms of business that’s the biggest statement. (35:35)
Because basically [crosstalk 00:00:35:36]- (35:37)
… what he’s saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that, Texas? Will you remember that, Pennsylvania? (39:27)
Thank you, thank you. Well, that was quite interesting watching. A little truth to that. Nah, nah, can’t… we can’t do that to our country. We can’t do that to our country. If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician is because I’m not a politician. And if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than any president has ever fought for the people of this country.(40:07)
One of the most important issues of this election is law and order. You know very well in Pennsylvania what’s going on. Joe Biden and his party have spent the entire year inciting violence and hatred against our great police officers. And remember this, it’s all Democrat-run cities, radical left Democrats, Democrats. You look at what’s going on, all Democrat-run cities. Republicans have no problems, our cities are doing great, but it’s all Democrats. This week the City of Philadelphia, I know it well, was ransacked by violent mobs and Biden supporters. More than 50 great police officers were injured and they weren’t allowed to do their job. They were standing… You have great police. I know the police departments, everybody’s endorsement. Remember the debate. I said, “Name one law enforcement agency or establishment, Joe, that endorsed you.” He couldn’t name one. Couldn’t name one.(41:22)
Our opponents stand with the rioters, they stand with the anarchists, they stand with the looters. We stand with the heroes of law enforcement, okay? Got to let them do their job. I’m not just running against Sleepy Joe Biden, I’m running against the left-wing media, the big tech giants, these people back here, and the Washington swamp. I’m also running against some rhinos, we still got some of them left, they’re on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. They just about gone but you don’t want them to come back. The rhinos, the rhinos are worse than the angry, angry sicko Democrats, the ones that have gone off the ledge. But you can save your country by voting in record numbers on Tuesday. You got to get out and vote. Look again, it’s the most important election, you got to get out and vote.(42:15)
The great red wave we talked about, right? Red wave. And you can send a message that they will never forget. This election is a choice between a Biden depression, that’s what you’re going to have, or a Trump super boom. You’re going to boom. You’re going to boom. We were there. And even now look through all of this, your 401Ks they had a little hiccup because… Look, they think if he had a chance it’s a disaster. You watch, we’re going to win.(42:49)
First of all, the first call I’m going to get are the people, the leaders in Iran, let’s make a deal. Let’s make a deal. China they’re dying to do something. They all want to talk. I don’t want to talk to them. I said, “We’ve got to get an election over with,” and they have to take the chance. Can you imagine Iran, the worst deal, $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash, and they said, “Let’s wait till after the election.” I said, “I agree with you.”(43:15)
It’s a choice between a Biden lockdown or a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic and it’s ending anyway, it’s making the turn anyway, but we have the vaccines are coming and they’re coming soon. They’re coming very, very soon. We’re going to have an incredible economy. Next year. You know last year was the best year that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has ever had. I could almost say it with every state, I could say it with any state, it was the best year. We had it closed it down, we saved all those lives and now we opened it and I said, “Super V,” right? I actually said V. “ell, now I can say it’s a super V. At 33.1 which you won’t read about… we will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks. We have our military all set up. They do soldiers, greatest military in the world. We’ve totally rebuilt our military in three and a half years.(44:10)
The pandemic will quickly be eradicated, and wipe out the China plague. We’ll get rid of it once and for all. We’re going to get rid of it. Look at what’s happening in Europe how bad that is that’s so terrible. And they’d always say, “Look at Europe, look at Europe.” Well, they’re not doing too well. And if you look at our numbers, our numbers are so incredible. And our economy went down much less and it’s come back much, much faster. Biden opposed the China travel ban, he opposed the Europe travel ban. I closed it very early and he said I shouldn’t do it. Think of this, “He shouldn’t do it, he’s xenophobic.” I think he called me a racist too which I don’t like. Look, “He shouldn’t do it, he’s xenophobic. He’s in a xenophobic.” He was saying this two months later. Now he runs he said I should have closed it sooner.(44:58)
This guy between the fracking and the ban and everything else. And he wants to delay the vaccine and impose a year’s long lockdown. Nope, you got to open up, got to open up. We know the disease. We’re going to have all of the different things, including the therapeutics which I think might be a cure because something happened to me, I’ll tell you what. Something happened. It might be a cure, but the… they call it therapeutics. But what we’ve done and what we’ve done in terms of mortality rates are incredible. And we’re going to go over that. The Biden lockdown will result in the deaths of Americans from suicide, drug overdoses, deferred medical care, abuse. I mean, you can’t do this. You got to open them up. The families have to, the families can’t live like this any longer. You can’t live like this, we want to open up our country.(45:50)
Now, part of the reason they’re doing it, a big part probably is political. They want to keep it closed. New York… What’s going on with my beautiful New York? I left… I left three and a half years ago and what’s happened to New York in terms of crime and all of the problems. It’s like a ghost town. What’s happened to our great New York? Chicago, what’s happened to Chicago? Portland, look at that. We could solve Portland, they’re anarchists. We love the anarchist because we can knock them out in about 20 minutes, okay? All the governor has to do… “Call, Governor, call,” I’ve been saying to her, “Call, Governor, just call.” Speak to them all the time. We’ll come in, we’ll take care of the problem. We were going into Seattle. We informed them we’re going in, we’re just going in. They took over a part of Seattle, can you believe this? They took a… This is the radical left, they took over a part. We said, “We’re going in.” You know what happened? The night before they held up their hands, they said, “We’re leaving now. Thank you very much.” We had no choice.(46:48)
Biden will imprison. Your people, your families, in your house while letting rioters roam free and loot your streets and loot your store. Under Biden, there will be no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, no Easter, no 4th of July. There will be no future for our country. Other than that, he’s going to do a great job. I guess a total disaster. Everything he’s touched has been bad. He’s a disaster. Biden will trap you in an endless nightmare of deadly lockdowns and lay-offs. He wants to lockdown. You know the virus is coming back a little bit. What slows up our country. No, can’t do that.(47:34)
We understand that. We understand we have to protect our elderly. We know exactly what to do. I’m delivering the great American comeback. It’s going to be one of the greatest comebacks of all time. And the numbers are far better than we thought. The numbers, you heard the numbers, 33.1. And again, they don’t talk about it. If this were Obama, they would say 33. 1, he’s the greatest president of all, he’s so great. He’s so great he gave us 142 federal judges to fill. If I were in his… If I were a radical left or a liberal and a president left office and gave 142 federal judgeships, including Court of Appeals, for Donald Trump to fill, who has a very different philosophy, you’re no longer a good president, nobody mentions that. But we’re going to have, by the time the end of our first term, just our first term, 300, approximately 300 federal judgeships and three Supreme Court Justices.(48:43)
And Amy, everybody loves Amy. She just got under the [inaudible 00:12:46]. Just got on. Think of that, three Supreme Court Justices, and think of that. 300. But I say, “Thank you, President Obama, for allowing us to have 142.” Because that… you know, usually when a president leaves zero, their nuggets of gold. People want that, you know, it’s such an important position, nothing much more important. People say it’s the most important thing a president can do. I would say the military maybe, but it’s okay. They say it’s the most important thing. We’re going to have 300. I mean, think of it, it’s never happened before.(49:21)
You know the job we’ve done, you are so lucky that I’m your President. So lucky. You are so lucky that we took this journey together. This wonderful, this beautiful journey together. You are so lucky. Pennsylvania, you are so lucky, you better get out and vote on Tuesday. Get out and vote.(49:42)
That’s very nice. That’s very nice though. That’s a chant that nobody’s ever heard politically. That’s really nice, we love you and I love you too, I do.(50:07)
I had an easy life before I did this, but you know what? I would never change it because we have done more in the first three and a half years than any administration has ever done for our military, for so many different things. But I appreciate. But you know that’s a chant, nobody’s ever heard that chant. Even these characters back there, there’re a lot of them back here. But that’s a chant nobody’s ever heard, we love you, we love you. I mean, two guys are back there, they look like they’re from the UFC, UFC, and they’re crying when they’re saying it. They haven’t cried in 20 years. They haven’t cried since they were a baby and maybe didn’t even cry then, but they were crying. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. I do appreciate it.(50:57)
If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your great family, and freedom to live your life, you must vote Republican. You have to vote Republican.(51:12)
So we’re joined today by some warriors and I really like them and they’ve been incredible. Congressman Dan Meuser, Dan, thank you, Dan. Great job. And Congressman Lloyd Smucker. My campaign state chairwoman, someone who’s really good, well, let me ask her. How are we doing, Bernie? Where’s Bernie? How are we doing? Our Bernie, great, Bernie Comfort, great job you’re doing. I’d be… Let me just hold that. I’ll let you know about great job within a couple of days. Hopefully, not much longer than that.(51:56)
And a man who… I know, I tell ya, he’s just… He and I grew up, I like the Yankees, I like the Mets and this guy was some player. Mike Piazza. Mike. Mike, you look good, Mike. They could use you. This guy was great. His father was great. They were… Man, he could hit, he was a natural hitter, he was just a natural-born hitter, and a great catcher, by the way. We forgot that, right? We forgot that he was a great catcher and a great athlete, a great… Thank you, Mike, it’s an honor. Thank you, man.(52:33)
We have a lot of great champions that are on this campaign. Tremendous champions. Brett Farve was there yesterday. I was in… Yeah. I was in a place called Green Bay, they like him in Green Bay. And we love Mike. Thank you, Mike, very much. What an honor.(52:51)
For decades our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations and now we’re finally rebuilding our nation. I think it’s… I think it’s time. Biden is a hateful man. You can see it in the way he angrily shouts his speeches. Great agitation. He can never unite us because he’s spent five decades in Washington trying to divide us. For 47 years Joe Biden betrayed black Americans and viciously attacked their communities. In 1994 and that crime bill, that horrible crime bill, he devastated black families, and they know that. And one of the things we’re seeing from other states is he’s not doing very well with African American votes. They don’t like him. I signed landmark criminal justice reform and I announced the platinum plan, which will create 3 million new jobs for black Americans. And deliver school choice for every family in our country. And then he went around in 1994-(54:02)
And then he went around in 1994 and around that time, and started calling young black people super predators. Right? Super predators. You can’t do that, and they remember that, and that’s why he’s doing terribly with African Americans. He’s doing very badly. He’s trying to figure it out. I could say, “Joe, I can figure it out for you, Joe.” I achieved the most secure border in history. Our opponents want open borders. Open borders. If you don’t have borders, you don’t have a country. By the way, the wall is almost complete. 400 plus miles, it will be complete very soon and it’s made a difference. We have the most secure southern border we’ve ever had by far. To protect our security, I suspended the entry of foreign … and you know what this is all about. You’ve been seeing what’s going on in France lately. It’s been terrible. I called up President Macron and I extended our sympathies and best wishes, but they had terrible terrorist attacks over the last few days, and more than one.(55:06)
I suspended the entry of foreign refugees from terror afflicted nations. If you don’t mind, I don’t think … Biden has pledged a staggering 700% increase in the manifesto that he agreed to with … I call it the manifesto because that’s what it is, with crazy Bernie Sanders. He’s a crazy guy. Mike, this guy is one of the greatest loses, Bernie Sanders. He loses with Hillary. He goes back to voting. He loses again. Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren, all she had to do … no. All she had to do was get out two weeks earlier. He would have won … Bernie would have won everything. Similar ideology, not a good one, but similar. But Bernie goes back and he’s supporting now Joe. I don’t know. He’s a great sport. He’s a great loser.(55:57)
Mike wouldn’t be doing that. Mike would be ripping people apart, wouldn’t you, Mike? 700% increase. Think of that. He wants a seven … they’ve agreed to it. Not once. They’ve agreed to it with AOC plus 3. You know what that is? AOC plus 3. One of the three is in Ilhan Omar. That’s we’re going to win Minnesota.(56:20)
700% increase in refugees from those violent terrorists hotspots all over earth, including Syria, Somalia and Yemen. No, thank you. Do I have your approval, Pennsylvania? Do I have your approval? I think so. I think so.(56:38)
He vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. In other words, “Come on in, everybody. Enjoy the United States. We love you very much.” Biden will open the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism and I am keeping the terrorists the hell out of our country, If you don’t mind. If you don’t mind. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States military, the biggest investment ever made. Our military was totally depleted when I took over, right? It was depleted. Our planes were old, our jet fighters. They used to go to the desert, the graveyards, airplane graveyards, to take parts out of old planes and bring them in. Now we have brand new F35 fighter jets and tankers and submarines and missiles and rockets, and our nuclear has been fixed to a level that you wouldn’t believe, and we have the super-duper missiles that go very quickly.(57:43)
We were very, very … hypersonic, they call them, right? Hypersonic. They go rather quickly, seven times the speed of our fastest missile right now. The best in the world. We saved the Philly shipyard and Biden shut it down. Biden shut it down. We also passed VA Choice and VA Accountability for our veterans and we just got a 91% approval rating and he’s got a 91% approval rating as a great catcher. He might have higher than that. Hey, you might be 99%. We killed the leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. We took out the mass murder of U.S. troops and many troops all over the world. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. “Here’s a $150 billion. Make a short term deal. It’s almost expired.” If I didn’t terminate it, it would have been … it’s getting close to expiring. Short-term deal, basically. Countries, not like you’re leasing a store. It’s a country. Made a short term deal. $150 billion and 1.8 billion in cash. You ever see 1.8 billion in cash?(58:59)
I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and presidents have wanted to do that for many, many, many decades and they never had the guts to do it. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’d been working on that for 52 years. I did it in two hours. It took two hours. Instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East. You see what’s happening? That coming in? No blood in the sand. Did it the opposite way. I said, “How have they done it?” And I said, “Good. Let’s do it the opposite way.”)
[inaudible 00:05:39].(59:36)
That’s very nice. So I’ve been nominated for … Now I hear it’s four. Nominated. But think of it and not just the Middle East. So we had a case, we’re making trade deals with Kosovo and Serbia. Kosovo, Serbia.. They’ve been killing each other for decades. They fight. That’s what they do. They kill each other, so many years. So we’re doing one deal, another deal, and they come in and tell me they’re doing a deal with Kosovo, deal with Serbia. I said, “Wait a minute. They’ve been killing each other for decades and decades. I don’t want to do the deal. Tell them I’m not doing the deal unless they make peace. They have to come in and make economic peace. They have to make peace. They don’t have to kill each other.” I’m saving lives. You could say, “What does that have to do with us?”(01:00:32)
You know how long it took me? About three minutes. I said to my guys, I said, “Tell them I’m not …” They want to make a deal. Everyone wants to do with us. Everyone now, especially, but everyone wants to do with us. So I went to them, I said, “No, tell them they got to stop killing each other. And good people. Good here, good there. Stop killing them.” You know what? Within a short period of time, we made a deal, right? That way we were nominated for a Nobel peace prize. I said, “That one took me about 15 minutes.” We made a deal and the leaders came into the Oval Office and they were hugging and kissing and they was so happy with each other. I said, “isn’t that nice?” So smart. You say, “Hey, we’re making deals. Let’s tell them they got to get along.” And it was great and a lot of people … we saved a lot of lives and you know what? Cost us nothing. It didn’t do anything. We’re saving a lot of good people, lives.(01:01:24)
So we got that little … but they won’t give [inaudible 01:01:27]. They won’t give it. They just probably talk. But I hear it’s an extraordinarily left organization, but if they do … Somebody said, “You definitely deserve them,” and that’s true. Obama got one. Remember? He had no idea why. He got elected president, immediately after his election, “We have nominated you for a peace prize,” and it was a massive story. When I got nominated, I got nominated for peace in the Middle Eastern, right? I said to my wife, you heard this story. I said, “Darling, I’m going to come home a little early tonight. I’m going to watch the news. We have big news today. I’m going to get the greatest publicity you’ve ever seen, darling.” She said, “What happened?” I said, “Well, it’s peace in the Middle East. I got a Nobel peace prize nomination. This is going to be really something, darling.” I turned on the fake news.(01:02:14)
They talked about a hurricane and they talked about a couple of fires where they should manage their forest much better and you wouldn’t have to … All you have to do manage your fires, you won’t have any fires. Right? Then they talked about a couple of other things and they talked about this and that, and after about 15 minutes, the first 15 minutes, it was a half an hour show, free airways from the government, even though it’s fake news. I don’t know. We have to look at that. Right? But think of it. Look, the cameras are shaking now.(01:02:43)
So 15 minutes go by. No mention. Now when Obama got his for no reason, he still doesn’t know why he got it. He’s walking around, “Why did I get it?” No, it was the biggest story. I remember it now. He was nominated. The guy didn’t even do it. He just got to the office. So 15 minutes go by, there’s nothing. It’s a little embarrassing. I have our great First Lady there. I’m trying to show off. Right? Right? You understand that, Mike. It’s a little embarrassing. Now we go into the second 15. She said, “Darling, I don’t think they’re going to mention it,” because they started talking about something for kids, something kids should do in the spring. I said, “I don’t think they’re going to mention it darling.” Then the next day or the next week I got another one and another one but this time we didn’t go back home to watch. Too busy. So it’s one of those things, right? I’ve done more in 47 months, then sleepy Joe Biden has done in 47 years.(01:03:44)
A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American dream, and remember Abraham Lincoln, the great Abraham Lincoln, was a Republican. Please remember that. Abraham Lincoln, over the last … long period of time, we’ve done a job. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China. It’s already started. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. Right? We will defend the right to life, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will defend your second amendment. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we’re doing. Bring them all in. We will end surprise medical billing, which is a disaster, require price transparency, already signed, and that’s bigger than healthcare. You watch. Already signed. January 1st it goes into effect.(01:05:05)
Can you imagine this goes into effect, so hard to get, and we have Biden as a president? They’ll say, “What a job he’s done. What a job he’s done.” And they go to him, “Sir, you’ve done a great job on transparency.” He says, “What is that?” I did it. I said to my people, “You have to start in January 1st?” But because of statutory provisions, et cetera, so it’s January 1st. You remember what I said, price transparency, bigger than healthcare. Wait until you see what I’m talking about. Lower drug prices even more than we already have, but it’s going to be favored nations. We have the highest prices in the world and we now will match the lowest prices of the world. The drug companies hate me. They don’t like me. Big pharma is not a big fan of mine.(01:05:47)
They’re spending more money on ads than sleepy Joe. They want me out. They want me out, but … China wants me out, Iran wants me out, Germany wants me at. They all want me out, but here we are, right? Here we are. We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Remember that. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That’s where we’re going. NASA, again, is the great space center of the world. It was closed and in disrepair when I took over. Now it’s the hottest place there is to space, and we get all these rich guys, right? We’re getting all these guys, very rich guys. They love sending rockets up. I say, “Go ahead. You can use our property, pay us something.”(01:06:37)
So they give us a little rent and they pay and they spend a lot of money and those rockets are good. Elan, Bezos likes rockets. They all like rockets. I don’t know what it is. I don’t know. What about you? Would you like to send a rocket? You made a lot of money, I know. One or two rockets is all you can manage, right?(01:06:57)
We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust. For years, you had a president to apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Pennsylvania. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your boss. Come on, boss, and get out and vote. You got to get out and vote on Tuesday. Get out and vote. The red wave.(01:07:53)
On November 3rd we must finish the job and drain the swamp once and for all. It’s a vicious swap. It’s deeper and darker and worse, but we’ve done a hell of a job and we’re still here and we’re doing it and it’s driving them crazy. For generations America’s destiny was made, forged, and won in places like Bethlehem, Bristol, Allentown, Altoona, Scranton, and Redding, all names we all know for a long time. Our American ancestors gave their blood, sweat and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, And the best is yet to come. The best is yet to come.(01:08:58)
Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.(01:09:28)
We one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America powerful again, our military. We have made America wealthy again. Look at what’s going on. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Go out and vote. Thank you very much."
trump_raw_rome_ge_clean.txt,"(00:00)
Thank you. Thank you very much. What a crowd this is. Wow! Well, thank you very much. Hello Georgia. Hello Georgia. Two days. Can you believe it? Two days from now we’re going to win this state again. And we’re going to win four more great years in the White House.(02:14)
We have done a lot. We’ve done a lot together. It’s been a great relationship with Georgia. Thank you very much. With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our police, support our great military, protect your second amendment. [inaudible 00:02:35] Defend religious liberty, and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase “Made in the USA.” That’s happening.(02:46)
Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. And it’s heading that way. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded, 33.1%. The fake news did not like talking about that number. We’d beat the number from 1952 and more than doubled it; much more than doubled it. They don’t love talking about numbers like that. They can’t believe it. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months. And while foreign nations are in a free fall, we are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world.(03:34)
A recent Gallup poll, just out, found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than four years ago with Sleepy Joe and Obama. If Biden and Kamala. How about Kamala? I don’t think so. That’s not going to be your first woman president; that’s not going to happen. She’s further left than Crazy Bernie. He’s like a conservative compared to her. And the radical left gain power, the economy will collapse, and our country will go into a steep, mark my… well, we’re not going to have to worry about it okay. Steep depression. We don’t have to worry about it.(04:22)
I shouldn’t even be here, they say I have Georgia made, but you know what? I said, “I promised we have to be here.” David. No, they said, “Sir, you don’t have to come to Georgia. We have it made. It’s won, it’s well.” By the way, just go out and vote. Okay. Just go out and vote. (04:56)
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. No, they said this morning, “Sir, honestly, we can skip Georgia…” I’ve done four of these, I’m going to Florida for another one. You believe this? Wonderful. Oh, and I had such an easy life before this. It was so…(05:10)
But you know I’m happy, you know why? No administration, no president has done anything near what we’ve done in the first three and a half years. How about it? We’re helping our country. We’re rebuilding our military. It’s rebuilt. Two and a half trillion dollars. We’ve cut your taxes. The largest tax cut in history. His is going to be the… Explain this to me. His campaign is “We will raise your taxes more than any administration has ever raised it.” I don’t know. Somehow, David, that doesn’t play very well, does it? Huh? He wants to increase your taxes by 4 trillion dollars. Massively increase your regulations again. We cut your regulations more than any administration has ever done. More than any, whether it’s four years, eight years or in one case, more, closed down your factories, send your jobs overseas, destroy the suburbs.(06:10)
Will the women of the suburbs please vote for President Trump? [inaudible 00:06:15] And I keep hearing from the fake news, “The women of the suburbs don’t like Donald Trump.” And I’m saying to myself, “Well, I’m giving them safety, protection, and I terminated a regulation that will ruin the suburbs and ruin the value of your house. And you’ll be fleeing the suburbs. And no, I did a lot for the suburbs, I’ll tell you.” Thank you. (06:46)
That’s what I thought. That’s what I thought. That’s what I thought. I made a speech a couple of days ago and I said, “Women of the suburbs, please love me.” And they took it on CNN, they said, “He is begging for their support.” Women of the suburbs, I’ve done a lot. You do not want to have a project built next to your house. No, we’ve done a lot.(07:14)
They want to terminate religious liberty, eliminate school choice, outlaw private health care. Would you say it’s windy enough tonight? Would you say? It’s wonderful. I said, “Is there much wind?” “No, about 25 or 30 miles an hour, Sir.” Oh, that’s wonderful.(07:31)
Shred the second amendment, take away your guns and indoctrinate your children with hateful anti-American lies. Biden has vowed to abolish American oil, fracking, natural gas. You ever see a guy fracking? For a year and a half, he’s going, “There will be no fracking. There will be…” Then he goes to Pennsylvania. They say, “What about fracking?” And he goes, “What should I say?” Well, they say, “You’re going to have to totally change your stance because they have a million jobs, right? It’s a big part of Pennsylvania. It’s a big part of Texas. It’s a big part of this country. And you’re going to have to change.” So now he goes, first speech, he goes, “No, we are in total favor of fracking.” And the fake news doesn’t even ask him a question about it. I don’t think I could get away with it. I don’t think so.(08:19)
How about the other day? He walks past the press, the media, the fake news. And he walks past, “Sir, what flavor ice cream is that?” He’s walking out of an ice cream store. “It’s vanilla and chocolate.” They don’t ask me questions like that.(08:38)
It’ll cause massive layoffs, exploding energy prices and crippling blackouts, just like they have in California. They’re doing great with California energy, right? They have brownouts; they don’t want to call it blackouts, but it’ll end up being blackouts very soon. Biden’s energy ban will send every state from Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania into crushing poverty. And you know that, the whole thing is ridiculous. The Green New Deal AOC plus three, I don’t even think they ever took… Did they take even an environmental course? Ilhan Omar is a part of that deal. No, no, no. She loves our country very much. As luck… that’s why I’m going to win Minnesota because of her.(09:29)
As long as I’m president, we will remain number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We are now number one. And something you haven’t heard very much of for ever, we are totally energy independent, isn’t that nice?(09:48)
I don’t think we’re going to let them turn that around on us. People that have no clue, especially Biden, he truly doesn’t have a clue. Our opponent’s agenda is a war on workers, a war on faith, and a war on our great police. Biden says he’s running as a proud Democrat. Well, of course he said, “I’m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate.” And I said, “He’s kidding, isn’t he?” But then he did it a second time. And I’m running as a proud American, okay? (10:39)
Thank you. Thank you very much. This is a lot of people here, I’ll tell you. We always have a lot of people, we really do. It’s like the spirit… wait till you see what’s going to happen with the Great Red Wave. And you know, I don’t know if you’ve been watching the results, but if you look at Florida, we’re looking very good. If you look at Iowa, we’re looking very good. If you look at North Carolina, we are looking great. If you look at Pennsylvania, we are looking very good. Oh, they’re going to be, they’re going to be some heads that are exploding.(11:26)
It would have been nice as… You know what would have been really nice though? If our Supreme Court could have ruled that everything has to be counted by the evening of our election, our grand election day. Wouldn’t that be nice? Instead of waiting around six days, eight days, nine days, giving them more time. If they want more time, let them put their ballots in early. They don’t have to wait till the end. Let’s give them an extra three days, and let’s take all the time you want. People want to know and you know, bad things happen in places like Pennsylvania and Nevada. We loved Nevada, but you have a governor there. Bad things can happen. That little intervening… Let’s take plenty of time. No, that’s a terrible ruling for our country. I don’t care. It’s a terrible ruling. It’s a shame.(12:20)
Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign Wars. Don’t worry, they’re all coming home. They’d been coming home; we’re down to very low numbers. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. That was another great deal we made. What a deal. China was flat-lined for years and years. And then they went like a rocket ship because of that stupid deal. Biden shipped your jobs in factories to China while raking in millions of dollars for him and his family, we find out. The only problem is the news doesn’t want to report it, and big tech doesn’t want to report it. (13:07)
No, big tech doesn’t want to report it. Do you ever see where they have trending? You know what they do? They take stories about me, if they can find anything bad, and then they make it worse. Trending Donald Trump did this. Trending… The most boring stories, I mean, with all the things happening. With affairs and this and that. They don’t want to hear trending Donald Trump. It’s a whole big hoax. It’s a big tech hoax, but we have some senators right here that are doing a lot about it. A lot about it. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who is bought and owned by China, okay? I mean, how is he going to… and by the way, we’ve taken in billions and billions of dollars.(14:03)
I mean, how is he going to do it? And by the way, we’ve taken in billions and billions of dollars. And you have farmers, a lot of farmers, I found that out with David, with David Perdue. We went down and they were affected a year and a half ago, very heavily affected by a hurricane. We took care of those farmers. Nobody else would have done it. We took care of those farmers. But you know what I did? $28 billion from China went to farmers, because they were targeted. Can you imagine Joe Biden saying to China? In fact, he actually said he’d take off the taxes and the tariffs that we charged. He said, “We’ll take them off.” But now we know why, because his son walked away with a billion and a half dollars in management fees.(14:47)
About how about where the son said he wants 10 million a year for recommendation purposes? You know who he’s going to recommend? His father. His father is going to be recommended. Or the son, who was out of a job, had no money, and then the father became Vice President, and all of a sudden the son is going to be put on the board of Burisma from Ukraine for $183,000. $183,000 a month. Who would not take that job? Who would not take that job? We said, “What’s your experience?” He said, “I have none.” “What do you know about energy?” “I have none.” There’s a young person right here, probably seven or eight years old, has more knowledge of energy than, where is Hunter?(15:39)
Then he said he wants a $3 million upfront payments also. But how about Russia? So Russia, you know “Russia, Russia, Russia”? The laptop from hell. Russia did a Schiff, watermelon face, Schiff, Adam Schiff. He said the other day, “Here we go again.” He said the laptop was created by Russia. This is, we are so screwed up. And he always says it in the halls of Congress, because you can’t be prosecuted for lying. You ever notice? He doesn’t say it outside. No, he got three and a half … Man, is it windy? Whoa. I wanted to show you how great my hair was. I was having a great hair day. But this is a lot of wind. And besides that, everyone else has a hat on. Everyone else has one. So if you can do it, I can do it too. Then he got three and a half million cash from the mayor of Moscow’s wife. She very generously gave him three and a half million dollars in cash.(16:47)
So when I asked during the debate, did anyone see the debates, by the way? I felt like Perry Mason. It is absolutely incredible. Look, the last question I said, “Wait a minute, does that mean you want to get rid of energy? You want to get rid of it all?” “Yes, I’d like to transition out.” I said, “This is the biggest moment.” That was like Perry Mason, the last one. And even anchor, Kristen Welker, who actually treated me fairly compared to Chris Wallace, who wouldn’t let us answer a question, actually, Chris Wallace came in third that evening, we won, no, I would say that Sleepy Joe probably came in second, Chris Wallace was a deep third, but Kristen Welker, who did, I mean, her inclination is not for us, but she looked up and when he said that stupid answer, she said, “Why did you say that?” Because she’s on his side.(17:49)
Did you see that? “Why did you say that? Oh, you ruined my evening now.” Nah, she was fair to me. She really was. I called her, I said, “That was very professional. I appreciated it.” No, most people said she didn’t treat me well. Relatively speaking, she treated me fantastically. In 2016, Georgia voted to fire his corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as President who is finally putting America first, If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician, thank you. That’s right, right? If I don’t know is played by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you. And I fight for you harder and meaner and stronger than any President has ever fought for you. That I can tell you. That swamp is deep and it’s vicious and they keep coming at you. But we’re there and we’re going to win. We’re going to win.(19:06)
Deep swamp. It’s a deep swamp, but we’re winning, and I’ll tell you what, we’re going to win. I mean, I wish they didn’t delay the whole deal, but maybe we can win by enough they can call it on Tuesday night. I just came in, and the beautiful thing about Air Force One, good looking plan, isn’t it, the beautiful thing about Air Force One, you have more televisions than you have in anything. They have televisions on the floors, on the ceilings, and one of the shows had very strongly, they said, “Do you see what’s happening?” And they go, “What? What’s happening?” “Trump is way up with African Americans, way up with Hispanic Americans.” He goes, “What’s happening?” And the votes came in, because you people are going to go and vote mostly on election day, which is good. That’s called the red wave. Don’t let anything stop you. Nothing. That’s called the red way.(20:06)
But these people, they send in their ballots and we’re practically even. We’re supposed to be 20, 30, 40 point points behind. And then we make it up and at the end we get it over the line, right? So, in Florida, we’re practically, even. They’re in big trouble. They’re saying, “This isn’t good. This isn’t good.” There are those that have already projected that we’re going to win Florida, that we’re going to win certain. This is not working out like they thought, I think we’re going to do even better than we did four years ago. And you know what? I never thought I’d say it, but this is even more of an important election. Thank you very much. I love you too. I don’t know who you are. I don’t know, male or female, I can’t even tell. But whoever you are, I love you too. This is going to be the most important election in my opinion, because our country can never be a socialist country. And that’s what they want to do.(21:15)
This election is a choice between a depression and a boom. It’s a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown … He always talks about locking down, “I want the lockdown. I want to follow science.” Some guy walks in, I think he should lock it down. No, let’s knock down a $12 trillion economy. No, we’re not going to do that. It’s also we come up a safe vaccine that is ending the pandemic. By the way, it ends with or without. We’re rounding the turn. But we have the greatest companies in the world and they’re all set and we’re coming up. We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks and it will quickly help us to eradicate it. It’s going to go anyway. It’s going anyway. We are rounding that. And by the way, they have therapeutics that work. Look what they do.(22:04)
I don’t know. I like to think I did it, because I’m in perfect physical shape, but I’m a young man. Like Baron Trump, he had it. “Sir, Barron tested positive.” White House doctor, Sean, a great doctor, he said, “Sir, your son, Barron,” 14 years old, very tall young man, Hi, Barron, how you doing? He’s great. But he’s strong. And Sean came in to see me, “Sir, Barron tested positive.” I said, “That’s not good.” “Oh, he’ll be fine, sir.” I said, about 12 minutes later, “Sean, how’s Barron doing?” “Sir, he’s fine. It’s all gone.” See, they have a strong … I don’t mean 12. You know what they’ll do? They’ll say, “He’s exaggerating. It took a half a day.” The fake news, everything you say. When I talked about illegal immigration, Joe Biden wants to give everything you can give to illegal immigrants, which will bring millions and millions of people in.(23:06)
So I said, “You can’t give them healthcare. You can’t give them education.” But Joe Biden promised them, every one of them, a free Rolls-Royce. CNN said, “This is a terrible thing. That’s not a true statement.” No, they can’t take a little bit of fun. But you know what? We’re in a position, we’re doing so well, we could afford to have fun. The one thing that happened, the one thing that happened that we can never, ever forget is what China did to our country. We can never forget. We shouldn’t have one death. But we closed it up. How would you like to be in my position? I just created, with a lot of people including yourselves, the greatest, strongest economy in the world, and now I had to shut it down. And we did the right thing. We shut it down. We figured it out. We have to protect our senior citizens. We protect, we know all about it, and we now have all these therapies and in my opinion cures.(24:07)
I mean, I think it’s cures, I think frankly. But we’ve done a great job. But how would you like to be shutting down the greatest economy ever? And now we’re building it back up, and we’re not talking about a V, we’re talking about a super V, based on all of the numbers that you see. Housing numbers, automobile numbers. 33.1, the highest ever by more than double. Joe Biden is promising to postpone the vaccine, delay therapies, and turn America into a prison state, lock it down, locking you in your home while letting Antifa and other far left rioters look letting Antifa, Antifa is bad news, you do know that, right, bad news, let them run free. You can’t go to church, right? You can’t go to your schools. You can’t do any of this stuff. By the way, your Governor, I don’t know if he’s here. Is he here? Brian? Where is he? Because Brian did a hell of a job. He said, “We’re going to let it stay open.” And Georgia is doing very well.(25:15)
The Biden lockdown will mean no school, no graduation, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, no Easter, no 4th of July, no future for American youth. Other than that, he’s doing quite a good job, right? Sleepy Joe Biden. You know what? In prime time, he was never a smart guy. Everybody knows it. And he was never a nice guy. And if he was a nice guy, I wouldn’t talk the way I talk about him. But he is definitely not the guy. He was in primetime, we called them 1% Joe. He always got 1% when he ran. Now, he’s got half left. He’s got about a half at best. And he wins. Is this a screwed up business you people are in or what? What a crazy business. A vote for Biden is a vote for lockdowns, layoffs, and misery. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family well, and freedom to live your life, then go cast your ballot for a man named Trump. We’re doing a job. We’re a job together. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I wish they’d show. Could the camera’s please span this crowd? They never do it. They never do it. And they never show Joe. So today he did a conference with Barack Hussein Obama. And you know what? The crowd was actually smaller. They’re not drawing flies. They’re not drawing. And they never show that crowd. But they should show these crowds, because in the history of politics, I think in the history of anything, including music, and I do this without a guitar. That’s very tough. We don’t have a guitar. Look at these crowds. It is one of the great phenomenons. They don’t like talking about it. They said, “Is he a great public speaker?” “Oh, I don’t really think so.” Well, what the hell am I getting 35,000 people? Today, I said to the great Hope Hicks … does anybody know Hope Hicks?(27:36)
Or Kayleigh? Where’s Kayleigh? Kayleigh’s great. We have such great people. Or our Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, do you know him? He loves these rallies. Took me three years to get them out of Congress. I tell you what, he’s doing a great job. So easy, it’s such an easy job, because we’re dealing with such nice people on the other side. But you know what? It’s going to all come together with success. I tell this, it was coming together.(28:03)
… success. I tell this, it was coming together. We were getting calls. It was coming together. Believe it or not, we were getting calls from the other side, people that you wouldn’t believe we’d be getting calls from. You know what? Let’s sit down. And then all of a sudden we got hit with the China Plague. And now we’re back to the drawing boards and next year is going to be one of the greatest economic years and all of that. But I’ll tell you what. Success, great success like we had best, if you look, African American numbers, Hispanic American numbers, women, Asian American numbers, high school diploma, no high school diploma, MIT, first in your class. Everybody was doing good and it was coming together and we would have unified, I’m telling you. And we’re going to have another chance at it because we are going to have a stronger year next year, because we have a great foundation and you see the kind of numbers coming in.(28:57)
You had your best year last year ever. You’re going to have an even better year next year. And like all these caps, Make America Great Again, we’re going to change them. We’re going to say, “Make America Great Again, Again.” But you don’t have to believe me on Biden. I brought a very expensive little tape for you to watch. Where is it? Lot of money. (31:41)
We saved so much time. We could run another couple of minutes. I could just say, “Bye-bye, I’m going to Florida.” I’m doing another one of these in a little while. The fake news can’t believe it. They’re exhausted. Look at all of them back there. Those cameras, they’re sagging. This is their fourth one, and all the crowds are big and strong and they love our country. They all love our country. We have a movement the likes of which this country has never seen before. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you, everyone. So joining us tonight. No, we have a movement the likes of which this country has never seen before, never seen. And you thought it was big four years ago, this is much bigger. This is much bigger. You know why? Because I’ve really lived up to what we said, and even more so.(32:34)
One of them said, he’s actually the only guy I’ve ever seen, “He’s done more than he promised,” which is true. That’s not a typical politician. But joining us tonight are warriors. Great people, people that I work with all the time, people that I like and people that I respect. Actually, a couple of them I don’t like that much, but I respect them and they do a good job, which is much more important. But one I do like and respect a lot, he’s respected like you wouldn’t believe all over Washington. People go to him for advice and he gets it done, Senator David Perdue. Stand up, David. Will you please make sure he gets in without a runoff? Do you mind? The guy he’s running against is nothing. I beat him running, he was running for Congress against somebody I’m going to introduce in just a second, but we beat him and we beat him easily. Now, he’s running for the Senate. You’re supposed to win at a certain level before you do this. David’s one of the best there is in the whole country. And you’ve got to make sure that David Perdue wins, okay?(33:40)
A woman that I got to know a little while ago, and she is strong and tough and wonderful, and she’s done a really great job, but I want to thank her very much, Kelly Loeffler. Great job, Kelly. Great job. A man who is very close to Kelly, thinks she’s wonderful, admits that she’s great, and she admits that he’s great, and I’m stuck right in the middle, and he’s somebody, and he really is, he’s a warrior, he was a warrior with the fake impeachment witch hunt deal. And you couldn’t have asked for better. He’s an incredibly talented guy and a good guy. And I’m just sitting back and watching these two, and whoever it is, you have two winners, you have two winners, Doug Collins. Thank you, Doug. You think it’s easy being me, right? We’re going to have two winners. We got two winners there. Go out and vote and let’s see what happens. But whoever it is, we got to two really talented people.(35:02)
Representative Rick Allen. Great job, Rick. Great job. These are warriors. Barry Loudermilk. Barry. Oh, I liked that, Barry. I like that. Thank you, Barry. Great job you do. We appreciate all that support from these guys. They really are, they fight hard, and they win. They know how to win. We were 197 to nothing, right? 197 on the fake impeachment. I’m the only guy in the world that got impeached over a very good phone call. Can you believe? I think you’re supposed to do something wrong to get impeached, but they took care of it. Former Governor for eight years and a very, very popular guy and so good at the farming business I made him Secretary of Agriculture, and we gave the farmers $28 billion, thank you very much, China, Sonny Perdue. Thank you, Sonny. And Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan. Hi, Jeff. Good, Jeff. Good job, Jeff. Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black. Thank you. Great, Gary. Good job you’re doing. Oh, here’s a guy. I love this guy. And I guess he’s not at least yet a Republican. Can you believe it?(36:23)
But he’s the hottest guy in politics. I see him on television. Everyone loves him. The ratings go up. I shouldn’t say Democrat. So I refuse to say it. State Representative Vernon Jones. Man, oh man. Great job. I love this guy. He’s got guts. He saw me a couple of times. He said, “That’s what we need.” I mean, we can’t have Sleepy Joe. Thank you. And he’s long before Joe. He’s a great gentleman too. He’s a great person. Georgia GOP Chair David Schaffer. Thank you, David. How are we doing, David? Are we winning? Are we going to win big? Can you imagine where they say, “Don’t come tonight”? Can you imagine? I’m going to call them out? You had people in line for two days. Let’s call them up and say, “We don’t need you because we’re going to win Georgia.” But you’ve got to go vote. You never know. It’s called politics. You never know. Got to be careful. Get out and vote. Let’s really send a resounding note to Washington.(37:27)
And a friend of mine and a great woman, and I hope she wins because she deserves it. She works hard and her opponent is absolutely terrible. She’s a total puppet for Nancy Pelosi, Crazy Nancy. Congressional candidate Karen Handel. Karen. You’re doing well, Karen, got to win. Opponent is zippo. Rich McCormick. Rich. There’s Rich. Good luck, Rich. I heard it’s good. Angela Stanton King. Thank you. I heard you’re all doing well. Somebody that gets a little more publicity than I do, Marjorie Taylor Greene right here from Northwest Georgia. Oh boy. I don’t want to mess with her. No, she’s great. Every one of them has my full and complete endorsement. Go out and vote for them and let them all come into Congress. Really great. That’s great. For 47 years, Sleepy Joe Biden viciously and repeatedly attacked Black Americans. He decimated the Black middle class and called young Black men “super predators”, and they never forgot it. They never forgot it. To every Black American, I’m asking you to go out and vote. You can send a message on Tuesday to the corrupt Democrat establishment. This is your one and only chance to show Sleepy Joe what you think of his decision to attack you, insult you, jail you, and betray you. And that’s what he did. That’s what he did exactly. Some people won’t say it like I say it, but I’ll say it. And you know it. You know it. I’m fighting for you. And I got approved things that they never thought, that Obama didn’t even try. They never had a chance. And we had to twist a lot of arms, didn’t we, David. We had to twist a lot of arms. Criminal justice reform, prison reform opportunities zones, and funding for historically Black colleges and universities.(39:43)
I always say that with a possible exception I like to keep the word possible in, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, I have done more for the Black community than any other President. I say it. I said it during the debate. I say it, I say it proudly. And very few people can dispute it. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history, including over 400 miles of completed wall. And it’ll be finished very soon. Strongest border we’ve ever had. And by the way, Mexico is paying for the wall, so we get that one clear. It’s all done. Joe Biden wants to open borders, he wants mass amnesty, and he would make every community in America into a sanctuary city. I believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal alien. The Biden-Harris plan would also increase refugees a staggering 700%. This is Crazy Bernie, one of the greatest loses in the history of politics.(40:59)
No, he keeps losing and then he goes back and he says but he’s running again in four years, don’t worry about it. He’ll be back. One thing about him, you can’t get rid of him. I like that about Crazy Bernie. Opening the flood Gates to radical Islamic terrorism. No thank you. I’m keeping the terrorists and jihadists and violent extremists the hell out of our country, if it’s okay with you. If it’s okay with Georgia, if it’s okay with Georgia. Well, I’ll tell you what. Thank you. I saw some very good numbers today. I appreciate it. But get out and vote. So, in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. And we’re doing it. We’ve already started. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help, we will …(42:03)
With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment. We will defend your second amendment. We will maintain Americans and rivaled military might. We are the envy of the world with our military. We had an obsolete, exhausted, tired military. We have totally rebuilt our military and we will ensure peace through strength. Greatest equipment in the world, all made in the USA. And a lot of it, I hate to say it’s made right here in Georgia. We will end surprise medical billing, require prices transparency, already approved and signed. January 1st that kicks in. Lower drug prices even more. We’re going to favorite nations where we get the lowest price in the world. And the drug pu… They do not like me too much is big, they call it big pharma, big pharma is not a big fan of Trump. They don’t like what I did.(43:07)
But you know what? It’s the only way you break that whole cartel. You have to break it. You’re going to have drug prices going down 50, 60, 70%. And they’re going more commercials on me than sleepy Joe Biden. In fact, he keeps saying, who’s doing those great commercials. It’s the drug companies. All right, now you’re going to have tremendous price guts on drugs and prescription drugs. We’re going to protect your social security and your medicare, which they won’t do because when they allow all of these illegals to come in, it’ll destroy your social security and your medicare. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will add the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars.(43:59)
NASA is the talk of the space world. And we also have space force by the way. I never even used to talk about that. I never talked about that during, I realized after I was president that we needed it when I saw what was going on with Russia, China, we needed it. Space force first new, if you think, first in 75 years. Last was the air force, right? Brand new, brand new, and it’s doing great. And everybody wants to go into space force. 75 years since air force. And now we have space force and it’ll be one of our most important. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust.(45:06)
For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Georgia. Better believe it. And I want to thank Herschel Walker because I think he’s great. I used to watch him when he was in college, he was like a man playing with children. He would catch, he would carry that ball for 10 or 12 yards. That was what he had a bad day, right? 10 or 12. He made a lot of quarterbacks look genius. Here Herschel, here’s the ball. Here Herschel here’s the ball. He’s the greatest. One of the greatest. Where is Herschel, is he around here?(45:56)
I think I love Herschel Walker. He’s been out there and he is one of the greatest athletes. I think he said he does a thousand pushups a day and he is just something special. He’s been a great friend of mine for a long time for, I don’t want to tell you how long, but, so I just want to pay my respects because he loves this part of the world. He loves Georgia and Georgia loves him. You know, they did the ballot. Remember they did a ballad to Herschel Walker. You just hand him the ball, you win the game. Here Herschel 10 yards, 12 yards, 40. What did he average today? He averaged 11 yards of carry. Well, that’s pretty good. Hard to lose those games. So thank you very much Herschel you’re watching. Thank you very much. Thank you.(46:44)
And Georgia loves your Herschel and I do too. Two days from now, America’s fate is in your hands. Your vote can defeat the Washington swamp and the corrupt media right there. Once and for all. They have to get out to vote. You’re going to probably want to get, I always say early vote, early vote. But our people love to vote on election day, Tuesday. So go out and vote. That red wave is going to be all, it’s going to be the darker the world. It’s going to be the talk of the world.(47:18)
It’s going to be the talk of the world. From Atlanta. You know it, you feel it, you see it and you know, organically, these things are just rising up. 5,000 votes all over the place. And I mean, nobody’s ever seen thousands of cars. What do they have? Something 90 or a hundred miles long of cars, trucks, tractors. In Iowa they had thousands of tractors on this massive farm. Now it’s something’s going on. Never happened before. Nothing like this has happened before. By the way, crowds like this have never happened before. This never happened before.(47:54)
My competitor, he’s got those circles, those crazy circles. And he can’t fill them up. There’s five of them. So he has to press please come down and take one. From Atlanta to Augusta, from Savannah to Columbus and from Athens to right here at Rome, we inherit the legacy of red blooded American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and our freedom. Great people. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, right? Raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. The best is yet to come.(49:12)
Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.(49:39)
We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Georgia. We love Georgia. I love Georgia. We love Georgia. Thank you. That’s really an honor. Don’t keep doing that. You’re going to make me cry. I said, they’ll put up, the President broke down in tears tonight as they chanted we love you. No, we don’t want, I mean, I guess it’s okay, but somehow we don’t want to, we don’t want to have a crying president I don’t think. Right now we don’t want, we have too many things to do. But I do. It’s never been heard. That chant has never been heard politically so I appreciate it very much. Believe me. We have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Georgia. Go out and vote."

Thank you very much. Thank you. (03:06)
Thank you very much. Thank you. This does not look like a second-place finish. I saw Sleepy Joe. He had about 12 people and unable to fill up his circles. Thank you. Thank you very much. (03:42)
Thank you very much. Ah, Pennsylvania. We love Pennsylvania. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. This is a nice rowdy crowd, isn’t it? Only in Pennsylvania. We win Pennsylvania, we win the whole deal. You know that. Just like last time. We want to have the same result as we had last time. Hello, Scranton. Hello, Pennsylvania. Thank you very much. Tomorrow, we are going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we are going to win more four more years in the White House. With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, support our magnificent military, protect your Second Amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. Right? More and more. (04:57)
Thank you. Thank you. Remember, last time they said, “No, no, Pennsylvania hasn’t been won by a Republican for many, many years, many, many years,” and then we won. It wasn’t even close, when you get right down it. Thank you very much. Thank you. (05:42)
That’s really nice. Don’t make me cry. I’ll cry with that whole thing. I’ll cry. Then they’ll have it on, they’ll say the president broke down and cried in front of his fans. I don’t know. Hey, maybe would lift you up, right? You pick up 10 points for crying. I say, I still don’t want to do it. Thank you very much. It’s really nicee. (06:21)
Thank you. Nobody’s ever heard that chant before. It’s never a chance that anybody’s ever heard in a political way. We like Ronald Reagan, we like people, but nobody’s ever heard of that chant and we appreciate it. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. We have the foundation, it’s already done. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded. Last Friday, it was released. 33.1%, the fasted. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months, while foreign nations are in a free fall. You see what’s happening all over the world. We are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world.(07:11)
We went down less and we’ve gone up much more. Nobody close. A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago. If Biden and Kamala … You know Kamala, right? Kamala. Remember it’s the Harris-Biden administration, when he said that? The Harris-Biden … No, no, Joe. You’re supposed to go first, Joe. But Harris and the radical left and she is radical left. She’s further, I guess you could say Bernie is a conservative by comparison, right? No, she’s the most far left. The radical left gain power, they will collapse our economy and send Pennsylvania into a steep depression.(08:06)
Don’t worry about it. It’s not going to happen. I don’t think it’s going to happen. We’re going to win. We’ve got some big surprises. Oh, look at all of the fake news. Look at all of the fake news. Hey, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin. Kevin, turn the mic on them. Turn the mic on them. (08:39)
Biden will raise your taxes $4 trillion, massively increasing your regulations. They’re going to increase your regulations, may be more important than the tax cuts. We gave the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and maybe more importantly, we did regulation cuts, which were also the biggest in the history of our country. Whether it be four years, eight years, or in one case more. Shut down your economy, close down manufacturing, send your jobs overseas, destroy our suburbs and he will destroy our suburbs. I say to the women of the suburbs, “Love me, women of the suburbs. Bless you.” I terminated the regulation. Dissolve your borders, terminate religious liberty, outlaw private healthcare. 180 million people outlaw. They’re going to have socialized medicine. That’s what they’re going to have. Somehow, I don’t see Pennsylvania liking that too much. Confiscate your guns. Second Amendment in big trouble, and indoctrinate your children with anti-American lies. I just signed an executive order to teach our students pro-American value.(10:04)
Biden has vowed to abolish, extinguish and eradicate American oil, all fracking and natural gas. I say this because, we’ll give it an extra little time. This is Pennsylvania. This is a state, that’s a wonderful state. I went to school here. I went to college here and I’ll tell you what, and I know it well, a big part of your livelihood or your money, your income, your low taxes is fracking. He spent over a year saying he will not allow fracking. (10:35)
The first time he came into Pennsylvania as the nominee, which was a shock to everybody, everybody, all Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren had to do is leave two days early, and it would have been Crazy Bernie, instead of Sleepy Joe. I would have had a crazy guy instead of a sleepy guy. But he came in and after going for one year and she, forgot it, she still can’t say it. She can’t say it. But he said, “No, we will ban fracking. We will ban fracking.” That’s what he said many, many times. Once he got the nomination, he came to Pennsylvania. They said, “You’re going to have to do something because you have a million jobs and it’s a massive part of your wealth.” He walked in and he went from, we will ban fracking to, of course, we can have fracking. What’s the problem? Just remember this, it’s always … Yeah, that’s right. He said, play the video, and I might not have that one in the video today. But you know, he immediately changed. The fake news, the fake news, where is Hunter?(11:46)
Where’s Hunter? Hunter’s in a foreign country taking in 25 million today. He’s at a country that his father just left, picking up about 25 million. Now, that’s total corruption. But he went out, and he started talking about fracking. He said, “We will absolutely allow you, but not on government land,” and the press never held him accountable. They never held him accountable for all of the corruption that he’s a part of. Biden’s plan to ban fracking, is an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania. Biden’s energy shutdown will wipe out your jobs, decimate your towns, eliminate your factories and send your state into a nightmare of crippling poverty. You’ve been there. You’ve been there. You had the best three years that you’ve ever had, under President Trump. The best three years. The best three years.(12:51)
Next year will be the best of all. Watch. You see it happening. If you look at housing starts, you look at automobile manufacturing, you’re going to have your best year next year, unless somebody decides to come along and quadruple your taxes. Then, you’re going down here, which is what he’s going to do. A vote for Biden is a vote to ban fracking, outlaw mining, explode energy costs, and totally destroy Pennsylvania. You know that right? It’s going to destroy Pennsylvania and it can happen. It can happen very fast. You take a look at a country, take a look at Venezuela, same ideology. This was unbelievably wealthy, rich country, one of the richest countries, and now they don’t have water. They don’t have food. They don’t have medicine. It’s a very sad situation and it can happen here, just much, much bigger, but it can happen here with these maniacs. It’s one of those things. Joe Biden is a globalist, who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure on ridiculous, endless foreign wars. Most of you have never even heard of some of these countries. He shuttered your steel mills. I got them open. I got them open.(14:09)
I tariffed, very nicely tariffed dumped steel. They were dumping steel. China was dumping steel all over the place. You ask the heads of your steel companies. You wouldn’t have any steel companies right now. Annihilated your coal jobs and supported every disastrous trade deal, for a half a century. He was a cheerleader of NAFTA, which was one of the worst trade deals ever made. We have a very good one now, thank you. China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which lifted China into a great power, a great economic power, except they were going to catch us. For 10 years, if you study, China was going to catch us in 2019. Guess what? We were going so far ahead, and frankly, if you have somebody smart, real smart in this position, they’ll never catch you. They will never ever catch you.(15:06)
But, if you study The history, you’ll see, 10 years ago, 2019, they will catch, and they would have. If I didn’t come along, they would’ve caught you. They would’ve caught you. Then, we had the plague. We built the greatest economy in history, and then we had the plague coming from China. Came in, we closed it down. We saved 2 million lives. We saved 2 million lives and nobody gets it. The projection was 2.2 million modeled out. We saved 2 million lives. We understand the disease and now we opened it up. By the way, Pennsylvania, get your state open. Get it open. Terrible. Terrible. The governor has to open your state, Pennsylvania, has to open your state. (16:11)
Terrible. Wow. Get it open. Get it open, Governor. Get it open and count the votes, honestly. Governor, count them honestly. There was a very good poster last night, actually a good one. He has us winning everything, but he was on last night. How’s he going to do in Pennsylvania? He was on a show called Sean Hannity. Have you ever heard of it? He said, how’s he going to do in Pennsylvania? He’s going to win Pennsylvania, except for the cheating. We figure we have to leave 5% for the cheating that takes [inaudible 00:16:48]. Can you believe it, for the cheating that takes place in Pennsylvania? The guy meant it. A very great pollster, but he predicted he would win the whole election. But the question was, “What about Pennsylvania?”(16:57)
He said, “Well, you have to leave 5% for the cheating.” When the Supreme Court gave you an extension, they made a very dangerous situation and I mean, dangerous, physically dangerous. They made it a very, very bad … They did a very bad thing for this state. They did a very bad thing for this nation. You have to have a date. You can’t extend dates. The danger that could be caused by that extension, and especially when you know what goes on in Philadelphia, and it’s been going on for years. Governor, open up your state and please don’t cheat, Governor. Please don’t cheat, because we’re all watching.(17:38)
We’re all watching you, Governor. We have a lot of eyes on the governor and his friend. Couple of other governors out there too. Pennsylvania lost half its manufacturing jobs after- (18:04)
Thank you. Thank you. Pennsylvania lost half of your manufacturing jobs. Think of it. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who sold out to Pennsylvania, to China and also sold out for personal gain and family gain. Where’s Hunter? Is Hunter in the crowd? Where is Hunter? In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this corrupt political establishment, and you elected an outsider as your President, who is finally putting America first. If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. Probably, why, I’m here.(18:56)
If I don’t know always play by the rules of Washington or the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you, harder than anyone has ever fought. I will tell you that. Now, think of everything we’ve been through. Look, from before I came to office, from before I came … whatever, we’ll do that in a second. Boy, you are an enthusiastic bunch. You are something. Well, first of all, first of all, you’re known as a late-voting state. That means you’re smart. How about all the things, hashtag, how do I change my vote? Did you see that? After the debate, the number one trend was, How do we change our vote?” That was the debate. Did everybody see the debate? Yeah. They wanted to change their vote. A lot of people went, “Is this a Change the Vote state? Not so much, probably. I don’t think your governor would let you do that. No, we have some states that change-(20:03)
… I don’t think your governor would let you do that. Now we have some states, they’re changing the votes and it was started with the debates. And then they see the rallies, the biggest rallies, by the way. And I’ll say this to the fake news. In the history of our country, there’s never been anything like this. And this is at a pretty early part of the day. I wouldn’t say it’s exactly primetime. You had to see last night in Florida. It was amazing.(20:28)
But think of this. They write from before I even ran. I mean, I announced. Maybe before I announced, they said, “I hear Trump is … oh, let’s go in and do it.” But think of it. We were under investigation for three years and it turned out to be a phony hoax, and it was a phony impeachment. And based on the laptop from hell, the impeachment should have never been. It should have never happened. In fact, it should have happened against the other side because it was the other side that cheated. It was the other side that dealt with Russia. But think of it.(21:05)
And then they say, “President Trump, we don’t know if we like his personality. President Trump, he’s too rough. He’s too tough.” Let me tell you something, if we didn’t have a certain type of personality and if we didn’t fight, we wouldn’t be here right now, because we caught them spying on our campaign and trying to take out a duly elected president of the United States. And I fought like hell, because we don’t know any other way. We have to fight. But we caught them and they turned out to be the people that were corrupt. No collusion. They spent $48 million, they found no collusion. They had 18 angry Democrat prosecutors. I have friends that say there’s probably nobody that … and he was is one of the smartest. There’s probably nobody that he knows that could have withstood that.(22:05)
So we had 18 angry crooked Democrats. You had Bob Mueller that didn’t have a clue. You had all of this stuff. Think of it. We went through that for two and a half, three years, and then they say, “Oh, we don’t like the way he acted.” We were under siege illegally. They committed treason. They tried to take out a duly elected president and we caught them. We caught them. And then they say … I see it today. Then they say, “Oh, wouldn’t it be nice … ”(22:42)
And then I say … I see these guys on television and all of the big tech stuff, which is probably worse than them, right? They’re the new boss in town, right? Not the media. They just showed up, the big tech. And we gave the power to the big tech. But now I see it, I look at it, and I say, “Gee, they’re saying, ‘Tough administration, chaos.'” They created the chaos. All we did was fight back and we fought back well and we caught them and they’re all caught and now let’s see what happens, okay? Let’s see what happens.(23:29)
But we caught them. It’s treason. They spied on our campaign. Nothing like that’s ever happened. That’s a bigger event … I would rate Biden second. His family and him took millions and millions of dollars from countries that he deals with. He became vice-president. He had a son that didn’t have a job, he got thrown out of the military, and he went years with no job. And then he signs with Burisma for $183,000 a month. And then he wanted $3 million upfront payment. “What’s your experience? What do you know about energy?” “I don’t know anything about energy.” “Oh, that’s okay. We’ll put you on the board anyway.” And then he gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow’s wife, three and a half million. Well gee, Hunter, what did you do? You gave her some big advice I guess, out there, right?(24:25)
And then they go to China, he takes out one and a half billion dollars to manage, which is millions and millions of dollars a year. And then the big one, I guess he had to stop that one because they found the laptop from hell. But the big one was a request to China to pay them $10 million a year for recommendation services, for services. No services, it’s a payoff. Hey, you know what it is? It’s a payoff. And the big guy gets 10%. He’s not a big guy. He’s a little guy. The big guy gets 10%, and there was another one where the big guy gets 50%, right?(25:11)
But he wanted $10 million a year, and the tech and the media will not … wait, the media will not … this is actually a very big moment in the history of our country because we have freedom of the press. But we don’t. We have suppression by the press. It’s suppression. And if anybody even mentions that story … you don’t see that story in the New York Times. You don’t see … that is the second biggest scandal in the history of our country. First is that they spied on my campaign, that’s the biggest scandal. And they’ve got everybody scared, but you have a president that wasn’t scared.(25:48)
And I see it with Twitter trending. I know what trending is better than anybody in the world. I’ve been trending my whole life. From the day I was born, I’ve been trending. I know trending. They take a story, they make it worse. Boring story, boring stuff. They’ll take something and they’ll say, “Number one trending, Trump this. Number one trend … ” it’s not trending. What trends is stuff that you don’t want to talk about right now, not having to do with me either by the way. Look, what we have, and what’s happened, and you’ve seen it all over the last two weeks, is a horrible, horrible thing. The media is fake and corrupt. Big tech controls the media and they control the politicians.(26:39)
And you know what? You have a president that’s willing to say it. And it’s a very, very big event. And let’s say … and I’ll tell you what. I give Tucker Carlson and I give Sean Hannity and I give Laura … I give all the people that are willing to talk about it. No, the Tucker reports have been phenomenal. I give all of those people that are willing to talk about tremendous credit, because people don’t have any idea how dangerous this is for our country.(27:09)
They won’t even think about … a guy walks away with millions of dollars. He’s vice president, his son’s like a human vacuum cleaner. He follows his father and he takes the scraps. But the scraps are hundreds of millions of dollars. And we can’t let this happen. We’re putting a corrupt man up for possibly being elected. But here’s the story. I don’t think that’s going to happen. I think we’re going to have a tremendous day tomorrow.(27:41)
And when he announces his speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he said, “I live in Pennsylvania. I was born in Scranton.” He doesn’t say that his father left him. There’s nothing wrong with that. I went to college in Pennsylvania, right? But I don’t make the biggest deal of it. But he’s … “I’m a man from Scranton. I’m from … ” He left at nine years old. And that’s okay. That’s okay. But this guy is a stone cold phony, and honestly, he’s not equipped mentally to be your president. He really isn’t.(28:16)
You know it, I know it, everybody knows it. I have foreign leaders calling me saying, “Are they serious?” I say … One of them called, said, “I see that you’re down a little bit in the poll.” I said, “Can you believe this could happen to me?” I’d rather run against somebody that was good or even outstanding. But I think what we’re going to have is one of the great days. When he comes to Scranton, then he gives a speech, he’s got the six circles. He can’t fill them up. So he said, “Could you please move over here to the press?” He puts the press [inaudible 00:28:48]. And look at this crowd. I don’t know how many people are here, but there’s a lot of people here. And it’s windy as hell and it’s cold, but I couldn’t care.(28:58)
Look at that flag. Oh, it’s so beautiful. Look, I’ve never seen a flag blow like that. You know what that means? That means it’s windy as hell. That’s what it means. Wow. Look at that. That’s sideways, but it’s our American flag and we love it, right? Yesterday, I was thrilled to be endorsed by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. Can you believe it? Pittsburgh Post Gazette, and it’s the first time I’ve ever really liked that paper. And then once you get rid of the first one or two paragraphs, it was great. He said, “You might not like his tone. You might not like the way … ” and again, I’m a nice guy. I have to fight. I have to fight to protect me and to protect you. Because once I’m not here, there’s nobody else to protect you, that I can tell you. But they gave a beautiful … you have to understand, everything’s relative. They gave a beautiful, beautiful editorial, and I appreciate it. (30:04)
It’s the first time, thank you. I’m telling you, you’re going to make me cry with that. Stop. The president broke down in tears as they screamed, “We love you.” I don’t know if president Xi of China wants to hear that. Yeah, he probably worked like that. The first time the papers endorsed a Republican for president in over a half a century. So to the people of the Post Gazette, I would like to thank you. I will forgive you for your first one or two or three paragraphs, because they said, “However, he’s done a great job.” And I have, I’ve done a great job.(30:44)
But he said, “Put his personality aside,” but I’m telling you, the assault on this office has changed my personality. I can’t … it’s just one of those things. Joe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media and powerful special interest. They own him, they control him, and they know he will always do their bidding. And when he raises 300 billion like last month, I could raise much more than him. I’m president. I could call all these Wall Street guys, most of them I know. I could call the oil guys, I could call them all. I would be … I would blow his numbers apart. Give me two hours. I say, “Send me 10 million … we don’t need it. How many commercials can you buy?” We raised a lot of money.(31:31)
We raised enough money. Crooked Hillary last time outspent us four to one. And I actually got criticized. I said the other day, even against Hillary Clinton, he didn’t raise that much money. And you won the race, right? They don’t care if you won or not. They said they always have to find something. But I would be the greatest fundraiser of time. “This is the president of the United States calling for the head of Goldman Sachs.” “Hello? How are you, Bill? Is everything good? Now listen, I’d like $25 million within the next five minutes. Send it to the White House, please.” What, do you think he’s going to say no? I would be the greatest, but you know what? I chose not to do that.(32:18)
And when you see he raised $300 million, his people are making deals all over the place. Every corrupt force in American life that betrayed you and hurt you, they’re supporting sleepy Joe Biden. The failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars, they support Biden. The career politicians that offshored your industries and decimated your factories and you got it worse than anybody else just about. New England was hit hard too. They support Biden. The open borders lobbyists that killed our fellow citizens and gave them illegal drugs destroyed our families and so many people, the gangs and crime, they support sleepy Joe Biden. The far left Democrats that ruined our public schools, depleted our inner cities, defunded our police and demeaned your sacred faith and values, they support Joe Biden. And I see where they wanted to defund your great Philadelphia police. And you have great police. They want to defund your Philadelphia police. Have you seen that? They actually wanted to defund. (33:41)
They wanted to defund your police. I read it this morning. I don’t know. I don’t think that’s a good idea. I don’t think people should take it. You can’t take it anymore, right? You can’t allow it to happen. And every place we’ve got into within a half an hour, it was over. But they have to ask the federal government. They’re embarrassed or they’re afraid or they think they’re going to lose support. We want to go into Portland, we’ll settle that in two minutes. We were the ones that did the whole thing in Seattle. We told them we were going in the following morning. That night, they raised their hands. They said, “Well, I think we’ll leave now.” They took over a big chunk of Seattle. Now we can’t allow this stuff. If you look at what’s going on in Philadelphia, you look at what’s … that can’t be done. And they can’t tell the police to stand] back.(34:22)
They can’t tell them. They stand back and they watch people walk out with washing machines. A guy’s pushing a washing machine. That’s a disgrace, it’s a disgrace. And the world watches that. They’re all Democrat run cities and states. New York, Chicago, unfortunately, Pennsylvania, and many of them are closed, right? Because you know why they’re closed? Because they thought it would hurt our numbers, and then they saw 33.1. That was a big number. The anti-American radicals defaming our noble history, heritage and heroes. They support Joe Biden. Antifa and the rioters and looters and Marxists and left wing extremists, they all support sleepy Joe Biden, sleepy Joe.(35:17)
And by the way, just so you understand, because look, Joe has no clue. Joe’s not calling the shots. And I guarantee you, he won’t be calling them for very long. This election comes down to a simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the corrupt, selfless political class, or do you want to be ruled and governed by the American people? Which is what we’re doing, which is one of the reasons I’m here. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalist, communist, socialist, the wealthy liberal hypocrites, who want to silent, sensor, cancel, and punish you. If you want your children to be safe, if you want your values to be respected, if you want to be treated with honor, dignity, and respect, then I am asking you to go tomorrow and vote for Trump. Come on.(36:14)
Well, it’s up to you really. You got to get out. I’m telling you … again, I’ll say it again and again, Pennsylvania, I’ve done very well. You’ve had your best years ever. Pennsylvania. It’s going to be up to you. Such a big deal. Big state, everything … and we’re doing great in Florida. Florida’s been great. You notice they’re not talking about Florida anymore. Florida has been great. We’re doing great in Florida. So we get Florida. We get Pennsylvania. We’re going to get North Carolina. We’re doing great in North Carolina. You saw the poll come out yesterday in Iowa, way ahead in Iowa. We’re way ahead in Ohio, except we get sometimes a fake poll. We’re way ahead. We won Ohio by eight points. They say we’re further up than that this time, because everything I talked about, we have done, and more. We’ve done more than I talked about. Remember what I said four years ago? I am your voice and we will make America great again, and that’s what we’re doing.(37:42)
For the last four years, the depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me because they know that I don’t answer to them, I answer to you, and it’s true. We did this together. This is a movement, the likes of which this country … in a way the world probably, but this country has never seen. You take some of the things that have happened over many, many years. A politician runs and comes in second in New Hampshire, becomes famous for the rest of his life. We won … well, we won everything this time. We won 100% of the states and the primaries, right? But we won 34 states against a crooked person, a very crooked person. By the way, how crooked it Hillary? She deleted 33,000 emails. What’s happening with that? But we won. We won like nobody’s ever won. Nobody’s ever won like we’ve won. No, the likes of which nobody’s ever seen anything like it.(38:45)
And just to get off that subject for a second, 2016, we had a campaign, nobody’s ever seen anything like it. Can I be honest? There is much more enthusiasm for this campaign than there was four years ago, because four years ago I came and I was a successful guy, and I said, “We’re going to do this. We’re going to cut your taxes. We’re going to get rid of regulations. We’re going to rebuild your military. We’re going to this or that or that or that.” And I did everything and more than everything.(39:18)
We’re going to take care of our vets. We just got a 91% approval rating from the vets on the VA. Okay. No, but think of it. We did everything we said we were going to do, but there is much more. And you know what? That was a record. There was never a campaign … nobody’s ever seen a campaign like that. That and Brexit … look at him. We have Nigel. I spotted Nigel. Ah, Nigel. But I actually did see a list, Nigel. They said the victory of President Trump was number one. Brexit was number two, but it was a distant number two. And even Nigel agrees with that. No, Nigel has been fantastic. What a voice. Great voice.(40:03)
Nigel’s been fantastic. What a voice. Great voice. Great guy. Thank you. Thank you. It’s an honor to have you. It’s an honor. They know Nigel. Brexit, Mr. Brexit. But the level of enthusiasm and I think you’re going to see a great red wave tomorrow. And I think it’s going to blow them away and we get Florida and we get Pennsylvania and we’re going to get New Hampshire. We’re going to get New Hampshire. Get New York. Can you believe that? See the disadvantage we have, the disadvantage we have, because I think in certain ways you campaign totally differently. The disadvantage we have with the electoral college, you automatically lose, automatically. I don’t care if you bring back Abraham Lincoln and George Washington as his running mate, you lose New York, Illinois, and California. Okay.(41:06)
So now you got three of the biggest and the biggest, but you have three monster states. That’s an automatic loss. So you’re starting off so then you have to run. And so we ran Florida then we got Georgia. By the way, we’re doing very well in Georgia. We got Georgia, we got North Carolina, we got Pennsylvania. That was a very important deal. We got Pennsylvania. We got everything. Then we got Wisconsin and Michigan. We said, “Whoa.” Remember they wouldn’t give you the credit. We were two points short. We were at 98% of the vote tabulated, 98, and it stayed there for hours.(41:43)
And if I lost every single vote, right, every and I still went in. So I said, “Why aren’t they calling Pennsylvania?” They wouldn’t do you the honor. And then they called Wisconsin, great state. And they called Michigan, which hadn’t been won in years and years. And they took the glamor. So will you please give yourself the glamor this time? Give yourself the glory. Okay. And make sure your governor doesn’t cheat, okay, if you could because they’re known for very bad things, very, very bad things here. Can you imagine the pollster saying you have to allow 5% in Pennsylvania for cheating. That’s a terrible thing to say. Of course, everybody knows it’s true, but no. But we have a lot of eyes watching. They never had eyes watching. We got a lot of very powerful eyes watching them. They don’t want that to happen to themselves. Together we will defeat the corrupt establishment and we’ll dethrone the fail political class.(42:37)
We will drain the Washington swamp and we will save the American dream. We’re going to save the American dream. This election is also a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown or a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic and we build the greatest economic country that we’ve ever had. There’ll be nothing like it. We will mass distribute the vaccine. We’ve done such a great job with this whole thing. You look at Europe, they’re spiking, and it’s everybody that say, “Look at the way Germany is doing. Look at the way France is doing. Look at Spain, look at now, Italy, right.” Italy in a really rough patch. Then it went well, they’re all having a lot of problems. I said, “Well, they don’t use those examples anymore,” but we have better numbers than all of them.(43:28)
You look at our numbers, they’re better, and it’s bigger and a lot of the numbers you don’t get because believe it or not, there are some countries that don’t give you an honest kick, right. You know that right? It will quickly eradicate. The vaccine will quickly eradicate the virus and wipe out the China plague once and for all. And let me tell you we’re rounding the corner anyway, but we have the vaccines coming very shortly. They didn’t want to give me the credit. They were saying, “No, don’t.” Whoa, they fought me like crazy. Did you see that? They didn’t want it to happen before the election, but everybody knows. So we have the vaccine. It’s going to be very quickly delivered by our military. Our military is ready to go logistically. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state locking you in your home, but you’re already locked in your home.(44:17)
So I hope that doesn’t take away any of your incentive. You’re already locked in your home while letting far left rioters roam free. Isn’t that something right? You can’t go to church. You can’t take your family to dinner, but you can let people riot down the middle of your beautiful shopping streets, knocking the hell out of people, burning down your stores like in Minneapolis, burning the hell out of the place until we sent in the National Guard. That ended in 31 minutes. It was amazing when they started getting whacked with tear. I hope they weren’t aiming. Did you see Ali Velshi? He went down, Ali. I don’t even know who the hell he is.(44:59)
I just know he does a very nice job of shaving his head. This is Ali Velshi and this is a friendly protest. And behind him, the entire city is burning. It’s like Berlin on its worst day, right. They don’t report. If you have a bad in a Democrat run city, they don’t report it. I don’t watch CNN actually so I don’t know about it, but I did see the clips. And then the Allie Velshi then get hit on the knee with tear gas from our great National Guard. No, he got hit. He went down. I’m down, I’m down. What a group of people. CNN, how dishonest is CNN. But you know what? I think NBC is more dishonest than CNN.(45:51)
I think NBC and ABC. I think ABC is terrible. I mean, ABC is absolutely. How about where they interview me and every question is a kill. They go in for the kill and then they interview Sleepy Joe. And it’s like, “Oh, the most boring interviews.” They don’t ask him anything. They don’t ask him whether or not he’s corrupt. Are you corrupt? Hey, Sleepy Joe, are you corrupt? Remember I asked him that question and Chris Wallace of Fox wouldn’t allow it. I said, “Why? Why? Why won’t you?” Well, I don’t think it’s appropriate to ask right now. Chris Wallace, he is not Mike. He will never be Mike. He tries hard, but he will not be Mike. You know why? Doesn’t have the talent. The Biden lockdown will be no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Easter, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, no 4th of July, and basically no future for American youth.(46:44)
Other than that, actually, it’s quite a wonderful thing. A vote for Biden is a vote for lockdown, layoffs, and misery. You’re going to have a miserable time. You know what the fake news doesn’t know? They’re getting the highest ratings in the history of television. When Trump is gone, they’re all going bankrupt. They will go down. They’re going to say, “Oh, I wish…” They’re going to be calling we want Trump to run again. We want him to run again, the fake news. The New York Times, the failing New York Times will be out of business. Can you imagine? Yeah, four more years. It’s true though, right. Can you imagine these people, they’re getting the highest ratings on television. They’ve taken over for the NFL. People don’t like. How about basketball? How about LeBron? I felt badly for LeBron. I felt very badly. Down 71%. And that’s for the champion. I didn’t watch one shot. I get bored. Back, forth, back, forth. You know why? When they don’t respect our country, when they don’t respect our flag, nobody wants to watch. Nobody. And the NFL is way down.(48:03)
The NFL is way down. You got to stand for our flag. You got to really be great to our flag and to our anthem. And if you don’t do that, we’re not watching. (48:12)
What a crowd. (48:22)
What a crowd. (48:26)
Hey, I have three more of these to do. Do you want me to stay with you all day? Yes. So yesterday I did five. I actually did six because I did one early for some people, but I actually did six, but I did five. I got home at two o’clock in the morning in Miami. I got home two o’clock in the morning and I said, “Good, what time do we start tomorrow?” Eight o’clock sir. I said, “Great. Let’s go.” But you know what it is? I’m doing a run, a great, great marathon, everyone. One thing I’ll say, they say I can’t believe because Sleepy Joe will go out. He’ll talk for 10 minutes. He’s very agitated. You notice? He’s so angry. He’s got the shades on now. They should be a little bit larger. The aviators, right. Are they called aviators? He’s got the aviators on and he’s so angry. And he’s reading every word. He never goes off teleprompter because he gets lost.(49:24)
He can’t go off teleprompter. He gets lost. No, but the anger, but it’s not really anger. It’s agitation. You know what that means right? That’s what happens is when you lose it, it can happen to all of us someday, but you can’t let it happen to your president. I’m sorry. But he was so angry. He was so agitated this morning. The glasses were pouring off. The mask kept on, off, on. There’s nobody around him. The closest person’s about 60 feet away, a reporter that’s can’t believe he got this good location in the inner circle that’s supposed to be for VIP’s, right. Now he’s got Lady Gaga. Lady Gaga is not too good. I could tell you plenty of stories. I could tell you stories about Lady Gaga. I know a lot of stories about Lady Gaga. And Jon Bon Jovi, every time I see him, he kisses my ass. Oh, Mr. President. He’ll get something out of it just like everyone is. But you know what happens? You bring in some of these, they don’t draw. By the way, we draw much bigger crowds than these people. But you know what happens?(50:38)
He’ll sing a song or two and then he’ll leave and the crowd will leave and Sleepy Joe’s up there talking. That happened to Hillary too, right. They got Beyonce and they got Jay-Z, right, Jay-Z. And he started using the F word, do you remember, in front of this crowd. And it was unbelievable. He was using the F word, F word, F word, and the crowd is going. And then they laughed and the crowd laughed. And Hillary was standing on the stage with an empty place and she was talking and she lost and people were surprised. Let me tell you something. When you look at these crowds that we’re getting, there’s never been anything like it. This is just not the crowds. This is your ultimate poll. This is not the crowds of a second place finisher.(51:24)
They said yesterday, they said, “Well, some people are here since, Nigel, they’re here from 24 hours, 48.” We have people in line for three, four days, and then the press says, “But will they vote?” Well, wait a minute. They’re willing to go. They’re willing to wait four days, three days, two days, one day online. Will they vote? Will they send there for an hour and vote? I think they’re going to vote. Who is going to vote? Okay. And seriously, is there anybody here who’s going to vote for Sleepy Joe? No. No. Is there anybody that would have the courage to put up their hand? No.(52:11)
Ah, but he was born in Scranton. What a phony he is. He was born in Scranton. I’m a Scranton boy. Did you see I’m tired of the smart people? Did you see where he said he is. I’m tired of those smart people. But we want a smart person as president. You got to have a smart. No, he said it. He made a lot of bad moves yesterday, didn’t he. He was having a bad day yesterday. He’s tired of smart people. No, can’t get too tired of them. To me, that’s an amazing statement. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life, then go cast your ballot. You cast your ballot. We’re changing. We’re changing things too. You could say what it used to be, but maybe it used to be a little bit like this, but it was never like this. Things change I think with big tech. I think it really changed. Joe Biden personally ran the swine flu, right. He ran H1N1. Remember he can’t remember that. He always goes no, N1H1 isn’t it? No, H comes before N Joe, just remember it that way. H1N1 swine flu. Remember he said the what was that called? Who was that governor from I think it was Utah? He’s a Mormon. What was his name? His name was Romney. Oh great. He’s another beauty. He failed horribly and he was the laughingstock of Washington so he ran the swine flu operation. He was the laughing stock of Washington. Now, when something much more lethal that we have done a great job on except with public relations. I would say if I had Nigel handling my public relations, I would have been much better. We have done a great job on this and you compare us to other places and you see and bringing back the economy, opening it up except in public relations.(53:59)
But his own chief of staff said that he was absolutely terrible. He didn’t have a clue. He didn’t know what he was doing. And he told us, right, that I was xenophobic because I closed it to China, which was highly and heavily infected. And hen he runs it and he says I should have closed it earlier. I said, “How does he get out of that one?” You know how he gets out of that one? The press doesn’t report it. They refused to report it. The only way I can do that is look, I got all live television, all the lights, and the only way they can’t keep it off only for one reason, I get very big ratings.(54:32)
If I didn’t get big ratings, there’d be no way of communicating. Oh, and they’re going to miss those ratings someday. Someday, they’re going to miss them. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said that Biden has been wrong on nearly every single major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four years. Now, he with Biden. He worked with him and he said he was wrong on everything, and he is. And he is, but you don’t have to take my word for it because this happens to be a state that allow, I spent a fortune on building these screens. You’ve got two of them. Wow. Usually I bring one. It’s a lot cheaper. Roll the video, please. Roll it. (59:37)
All right. All right.(01:00:00)
All right. We shouldn’t be laughing. Don’t let that happen to our country. By the way, that was just a small… We could keep you there all day watching that. No, we can’t let that happen to our country. We’re joined by some real warriors, Dan Wowser, [Mouser 01:00:27]. Where’s Dan? Where are you, Dan? Dan, Congressman? Where are you, Congressman? Where’s Dan Meuser? Meuser?(01:00:39)
Thank you very much. Thanks, Dan. Fred Keller, GT Thompson. That’s good. With you, with the three of you, what warriors you’ve been. What warriors you’ve been and thank you very much. They were there at the beginning and they have been with me all the way. And you have a couple of former members that we love that we think are great, Lou Barletta and Tom Marino. Thank you very much, Tom, Lou. Thank you. Thank you very much.(01:01:07)
How are your elections going by the way? Dan, how are you guys going? You’re doing good? We’re going to win Pennsylvania. It’s a guaranteed [inaudible 01:01:17]. That’s good. [inaudible 01:01:22], you got to vote for those guys. That’s a great group. So your districts are looking good. You need an extra tweet or anything? You don’t need? This group doesn’t need anything. And also thank you fellows for coming. When are you going to re-run for office, Tom and Lou? Do you have anything you’re thinking about? Look at them. They look healthy as can be.(01:01:44)
Congressional candidate, Jim Bognet. Thank you, Jim. Thank you.(01:01:54)
And a woman who is doing an incredible job, campaign chair, Bernie Comfort. Bernie, thank you. How’s it going, Bernie? We’re going to have a big victory tomorrow I think, huh? We’re going to have a big one. We better, Bernie. I’ll fire you so fast.(01:02:11)
Another great friend of mine, a great guy, David Urban. David. David, thank you, David. And somebody that I know very well. He’s a tall young gentleman. His name is Eric Trump and he’s been great. He’s done great. Oh, and I see Jared Kushner right over here. Middle East peace. Middle East peace. Wow. Jared usually likes to stay in the plane and work. He’s working on Middle East peace and doing a great job. You wee what we’re doing. Thank you very much.(01:03:05)
For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders, but not defending our border. But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong.(01:03:29)
For 47 years, Joe Biden viciously attacked black Americans. He called young black men super predators all the time. To every black American, go tomorrow and vote for Trump.(01:03:49)
This is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, jail you and betray you, which is what he did. I’m fighting for you. And I got criminal justice reform, prison reform, Opportunity Zones with Tim Scott. Tim Scott, the Senator from South Carolina who is great. And funding for historically black colleges and universities. We got them the funding, long-term funding. And I say it all the time, I say it like this, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, a lot of people like me to leave the word possible out. There is no president that has done more for the black community than Donald Trump. It’s true.(01:04:38)
And you’re seeing that by the way… You see what’s going on in Florida? The numbers are very high, like nobody’s seen before, with the black community and with the Hispanic American community. Oh, the Hispanic American, they’re liking Trump. I’ve done a lot for them and they like me and I like them. I always have actually. And they are voting for us very big. They’re coming out in Florida in numbers and the Democrats are very worried. They say, “What’s going on? What’s going on?” You know what’s going on? I’ve done a good job. That’s what’s going on. So I want to thank… We have to see what the final numbers are, but I think I can say in advance, African American community, Hispanic American community, it’s been incredible what’s gone on in Florida. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You notice they’re not talking about Florida too much, right? They’re not talking. We get Florida, we get Pennsylvania. You watch.(01:05:35)
Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. You know the wall, the wall is over 400 miles long. It will be finished soon. And they don’t talk about that one anymore either, do they? Don’t talk about it. When you have success, they never talk about it. And you know what’s happening, you know what’s going, right? I mean, other countries are coming in. They’re studying what we’re doing. All over the place, they’re studying because what we’ve done, nobody’s been able to do. Joe Biden has pledged open borders, free healthcare for illegal aliens. No, not for you. No. See, I delayed that a little bit. Free healthcare for illegal aliens. They want to give them more than they give us and deadly sanctuary cities. We believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.(01:06:29)
The Biden-Harris plan would increase refugees from terrorist nations by a staggering 700% flooding into your towns and cities. I am keeping, if it’s okay with Pennsylvania, I am keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. Is that okay?(01:06:51)
I passed a ban early on and it ultimately got approved by the United States Supreme Court. But I passed a ban because we want people coming into our country that could love us and come in through merit and all sorts of things. We don’t want people coming into our country that hate us, can’t stand us and want to do harm to our citizens. Okay? So the ban was quite controversial, but it’s had a big impact. It’s had a big impact.(01:07:20)
And one of the reasons we’re going to win Minnesota? Ilhan Omar, Ilhan Omar. Although she loves our country very much. She loves our country very much, doesn’t she?(01:07:34)
We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States military. We have the finest military, the finest weaponry in the world, all made in the USA with the envy of Russia and China and North Korea. We have the best equipment in the world, rockets and missiles and submarines and everything that we’re building. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. $2.5 trillion made in the USA. We also passed veterans, we passed for our veterans, VA Choice after 44 years and VA Accountability. Okay. VA Account… That’s where you say you’re fired, get the hell out of here. You’re not treating our vets right. I told you we got the highest rating, the highest approval rating that has ever been given by our vets. 91% approval. Who are the nine percent? Oh, they’ll find somebody within the nine percent. They’ll be on television.(01:08:28)
We obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. we eliminated the world’s top terrorists. Soleimani is dead. I recognized the capital of Israel and open the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they worked on it for 52 years. And instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East. Good job he’s doing. Good job [inaudible 01:09:08].(01:09:11)
A vote for me and the Republican party is a vote for the American dream. And who was a very distinguished person within the Republican party? The late great Abraham Lincoln. Please remember that. He was very presidential. He’s the only one I said, “Maybe I can’t be that presidential,” but he was very presidential when he wore the hat especially, right?(01:09:38)
Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. That’s already happening. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. You’ve got them, you’ve got them.(01:10:01)
With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. Your Second Amendment is gone if I don’t get in. If I don’t get in, your Second Amendment, wave goodbye. And I’ll be sitting home and I’ll be saying, “I told the people of Pennsylvania, you better vote for Trump.” No, your Second Amendment is under siege. That’s right. We put [Amy 01:10:37] on. You’re happy with Amy? Everyone loves Amy. Thank you. You know we do. They don’t talk about that enough. They say it’s the most important thing a president can do.(01:10:47)
So at the end of my first term, I will have approximately 300 federal judges, which is a big a big percentage of the Judiciary and three great Supreme Court justices. That’s a lot.(01:11:02)
Many presidents have gotten to choose. Hey, whatever happened to packing the court? This guy’s running, he never gave an answer. Maybe he’s smarter than we think. Whatever happened? He never gave the answer. He never said. He said he was going to tell us. We’re running. People are casting votes. You cannot elect somebody that’s going to pack the court and he’s going to pack the court. And he didn’t give us a list of the radical left judges who wants to put on either. So he got away with it. So he got away with it. He just did because the press never pressed him. Right? See, there’s a case. If that were me, I could never, ever get away. He got away with it because the fake news wouldn’t press it. He never talked about packing the court and we’re voting right now. He shouldn’t get a vote unless he tells you because he will destroy this country. That’s a big thing, packing the court. Can you imagine? But they never picked it up.(01:11:52)
We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, lower drug prices. We’re doing favored nations. We’re going to have the lowest prices anywhere in the world. The drug companies hate me so much, ai-ai-ai. They are spending more money on ads than sleepy Joe Biden. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will add the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. NASA. NASA was like an abandoned place, to now it’s the hottest. It’s the hottest place in the world for space. And that goes along with Space Force, doesn’t it? We did Space Force. We never even talked about Space Force on the campaign, but we needed it. When I saw Russia, when I saw China, we needed and we got it approved.(01:12:51)
We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.”(01:13:18)
For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania. I know you well. I know you well. You’re a rowdy bunch today, but that’s okay. It’s rowdy, but it’s rowdy with love. It’s rowdy with love. [inaudible 00:13:44].(01:13:53)
Tomorrow, you have the power with your vote to save America. We will never be a socialist nation. That’s what we’re talking about. You’re going to be a large scale version, very large scale, of Venezuela. That’s what happens. It happens every single time. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers. Even grab your boss by the tie and say, “Come on, boss, let’s go. We got to vote. We got to vote.”(01:14:25)
For generations, America’s destiny was made, forged and won in places like Bethlehem and Bristol, Easton and Allentown, Pittsburgh and Scranton, right here in Scranton. Our American ancestors gave their blood, sweat and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. (01:15:28)
Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.(01:15:53)
We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, go out and vote tomorrow. We have made America powerful again. Our military has never been as even close to what it is right now. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you, Pennsylvania."

Oh thank you. Oh wow. This is a big crowd. We have a lot of big crowds, but this is a big crowd. This is great. Thank you very much. Hello, Traverse City and hello Michigan. We want the same result as we had four years ago from Michigan, right. And we fulfilled all our promises. You have auto plants. So many, you didn’t have one in 42 years, and now you have 17 and going up and they’re going so fast. I don’t know. Nobody’s complaining. I can tell you that, but we want that same result. We’re going to get out and vote because tomorrow we are going to win this state and we are going to win more years in the White House.(54:57)
And I want to thank you to our great Vice President Mike Pence. He works so hard. I will take him over Kamala every day of the week. We will take Mike. He’s great. He’s great. He’s done a great job. He works very hard and he had a good debate. Didn’t he have a good debate against Kamala from a different world? With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our police, support our great military, protect our 2nd Amendment, defend religious liberty, and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful term made in the USA, right. Made in the USA.(55:45)
Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You had a great year last year, the year before, the year before, three great years, the best you’ve ever had, and you’re going to have the best year you ever had next year. We’re all set. You saw what happened. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever, ever, ever recorded, 33.1%. You saw that on Friday. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months. That’s a record, while foreign nations are in a free fall, sadly in a free fall. And you look at what’s happening with Europe and other places. Very sad. We are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. You look at our numbers, look at the auto numbers. Look at what’s happening with that business and so many other businesses in this country, but that business because we happen to be in a place that likes automobiles, right.(56:47)
A recent Gallup Poll just came out, found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under Obama and Biden. And that’s during a pandemic and we’re rounding the corner. We’re rounding the corner and you got to open your states. You got to open your state, open it, open it up Governor. Open it up Governor. Open it up Governor. Got to open it up. If Biden and Harris and the radical left gain power, they will collapse our economy and send our nation into a very steep depression. They want to raise taxes at a level that nobody’s ever heard of before. Biden will raise your taxes over $4 trillion. It’s not him. Do you think it’s him? He doesn’t have a clue. He has no clue, but that’s okay. Let’s assume he does. We have to win. So that’s sad. Can’t do that to our country. Our country has too much unbelievable potential actually. Massively increasing your regulations, shutting down your economy. They’re going to close down your factory, send your jobs overseas to China and other places.(58:10)
I don’t think so. Destroy the suburbs. Are you happy in the suburbs that I ended the regulation that was going to destroy the suburbs, that has been destroyed the suburbs? The women of the suburbs, they love me I think, but the fake news says they don’t, but I think they do. They love their home. They love their house. They don’t want a development put next to the house. They want their house the way it is. They want to have their beautiful house and they want to have security and they want to have safety. I think they like Trump. I really do. That happened the last time. That happened four years ago. Remember they said, “Women will not vote for Donald Trump at that time. Women will not.” And then at the end of the evening where they were all crying, they say, “Women, what happened?” The women came out, right. The women like us. That’s nice.(59:19)
Well, I like the women. I will tell you, I think the women are great. You notice we don’t even talk about the men with suburbia. We let you guys be alone. They want to dissolve your borders, maybe rip down the wall. They were talking about that. Let’s take down the wall. We have our strongest border right now and the wall is almost complete. Mexico is paying for the wall by the way, but it’s almost complete. Terminate religious liberty, outlaw private care, 180 million people they want to take it away, go to socialized medicine. I don’t think so. You’ve worked hard for that. You have some of the greatest healthcare in the world. You’ve worked hard for it. They want to take it away. 180 million private plans, take it away. Now, if you feel a little bad or if you want to check up, you go to a hospital, you wait in line for about six weeks, and you get yourself checked out. They say you have a problem. They can’t do anything about it. That’s called socialized medicine.(01:00:18)
Confiscate your guns, 2nd Amendment, and indoctrinate your children with anti-American lies. And just a little while ago on the beautiful Air Force One. How does it look? Let me see. Oh, you don’t see it. By the way, how about the sky? Oh, so beautiful. Let’s just look at the sky for a little while. I wish we had time, right. I wish we had time. So I’ve made five today. Five of these, all with love, all with big crowds, all with love. It’s incredible. Somebody said I actually do six today because we finished up last night in Miami at 1:30 in the morning so. (01:01:11)
Thank you. (01:01:11)
Oh, thank you very much. (01:01:13)
Thank you. (01:01:13)
That’s very nice, thank you. (01:01:23)
Don’t make me cry. Don’t make me cry. If I started to cry, they’d have a big story. They’d say, ” The president broke down and cried.” And I don’t know if that’s good for us. Probably could, maybe it brings me up four or five points, I promise. I don’t care, but that’s really nice. It’s never been said before. They say there’s never been. We’ve liked Ronald Reagan we’ve liked a lot, but they say that’s the love. We love you. Think of it. When you think about it, right. It’s an incredible thing. We’ve worked hard. We’ve gotten you everything we said. We’ve done the things we said. We’ve done the things we said. We get you the biggest tax cut in history. The biggest regulation cut in history.(01:02:08)
We’ve rebuilt our military. Our vets just gave us a 91% approval rating on what we’ve done for them. We’ve got your Space Force and you’ll be making a lot of this stuff right here in Michigan. Space Force, that is the first time in 74 years since Air Force. Think of that, right. A whole new force. I just signed an executive order on Air Force One to teach our students pro American values. It’s a good thing with all the things that I’ve been watching that have been taking place over a pretty long period of time. Pretty long period of time, even before Obama and Sleepy Joe. Biden has vowed to abolish the American oil and natural gas industries and to ban fracking.(01:02:59)
Look, he said it. He said it. He campaigned for over a year. We will ban fracking. We will ban fracking. We will ban fracking. Then he goes to Pennsylvania and they say well, his people told him. He didn’t have any idea what they meant, but it was okay. He listened. So they said, “Listen, you have to be in favor of fracking now.” They said, “Okay, no problem. Why? I only said it about 200 times during debates, right.” So now he goes into Pennsylvania where we just left. Great people by the way. You talk about that was an unbelievably enthusiastic group of people. We’re going to win Pennsylvania. We’re going to win. We’re going to win Michigan too. We’re going to win Pennsylvania. We won Pennsylvania last time too. We won this one. We won. This one hadn’t been won for many, many years and Pennsylvania, the same thing. It wouldn’t, but then Trump came along. We won them both. We beat Crooked Hillary, Crooked Hillary. Now we have a guy that makes Hillary look like a baby. No, we’ve had a good time. And until the China plague came along, everything was good. We closed it down. We saved 2 million lives. Now we’re opening it up. We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had. See the hat, all the make America great again. Now we’re having it make America great again again. And our country was coming together. The other side was calling. Everybody was successful. Best numbers for unemployment, African American, Hispanic American. And by the way, do you see what’s going on in Florida? African-American, the numbers are phenomenal. Hispanic American, the numbers are beyond belief. They got problems. You notice they haven’t been talking too much about Florida for the last six or seven hours. They’re not liking what they see. Wow. That is a lot of people. Look, you can’t even see. Why don’t you take the cameras down there? You can’t even see the end. I hope you can hear us down there. It’s like two football fields away. I hope you can hear us. That’s great. Well, that’s really good, but no, Florida is looking great.(01:05:20)
You’re looking great. Came out two or three up. I don’t know why two or three up. Am I supposed to be happy with three up over this guy? I tell you, but you know what? Let’s just put the win in the column. We won’t even talk about it, but you’re looking great. North Carolina, great. Iowa came out. The big poll came yesterday you saw. And we were a lot up, big, big up. Well, the farmers like me. I got for the farmers $28 million. I got 28 million from China. Thank you very much China, thank you, because they targeted the farmers. They targeted the farmers. And I said to I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, “Sonny, how much?” He said, “Well…”(01:06:03)
Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture. Sonny, how much? He said, “Well, two years ago was 12 and last year was $16 billion, $16 billion, $12 billion, a total of $28 billion.” And I tariffed China. We took the $28 billion. We had a lot of money left over into the Treasury and we gave it to the farmers and the farmers are not complaining. I’ll tell you. They’re in business. They would have been out of business.(01:06:24)
Biden’s energy ban will send every state into crushing poverty. And you know this. You know what they’re doing. From Michigan, to Wisconsin, to Arizona, where we’re leading very nicely. Thank you. And to Pennsylvania. As long as I’m President, we will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on Earth. And we will remain energy independent. We’re energy independent for the first time. First time. That means we don’t have to call people up in far away places and say, “We need some oil, please. We’ll send our armies over there to protect you and help you.” But we do have great allies over there. We’ll help them. We’ve certainly helped Israel. But we have a lot of good people over there. We’ll help them. But we don’t need their oil. It’s nice not to. We have more oil than they do now. You know, we have actually more oil than they do. We’re the largest in the world. Isn’t that a nice feeling?(01:07:23)
Sleepy Joe, and that would not have happened except for what we’ve done over the last three and a half years. There’s never been an administration, or President, there’s never been an administration that has done in the first three and a half years what we’ve done, never and not even close. With all the things we’ve done. And the fake news never even questions it. I’ve been saying it for a long time. They don’t even question it because they can’t.(01:07:50)
Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless ridiculous foreign wars, countries you’ve never even heard of. A vote for Biden is a vote to extinguish and eradicate your state’s auto industry. You don’t like that. Do you? I don’t think so. You know, he was going to do the TPP. He was going to do different things that would have been so bad for you. I ended it. I ended it all. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA which was the worst trade deal ever made probably by any country that sent all your auto jobs. You know, they have 32% of our auto jobs, right? And it’s probably the number one reason I ran for President.(01:08:39)
And in fact, I was in Michigan. I don’t know if anybody remembers this, 12 years ago. They gave me the Man of the Year. You remember? I made a speech and I said, “Why are you letting, you know, it’s not my business,” but I said, “Why you letting them steal your auto jobs? They’re all going down to Mexico.” And by the way, plenty go to Canada, too right? People don’t know that. And it was a terrible thing that took place, but we’ve stopped that. And now the USMCA makes it very, very financially difficult for them to do that. It was very important to me. And everybody said, “We’ll never be able to do it. We’ll never be able to end NAFTA.”(01:09:15)
And you know why? Because it was so good for Canada and so good for Mexico. And they have a lot of power, but we ended it. And they’re not that happy, but they’re happy enough. And we have a great deal and I’ll tell you, Mexico, we’ve had a great relationship with Mexico. Canada is a little difficult to deal with, to be honest with you. You know, Oh Canada, we all love Oh Canada, right? I love that. They stand for their national anthem and we have to stand too, because you know, you saw the ratings from the NBA down 71% for their championship. You know why? Because people don’t want to hear it. They don’t want to hear it. They want to see a basketball game, obviously, not too much. But I didn’t watch it and a lot of people didn’t watch it. And the NFL has to be very careful. They tried that game two years ago and I thought we taught them a lesson, and they have to be very careful. We have to respect our flag, we have to respect our anthem, and we have to respect our country.:15)
USA! USA! USA! USA!(01:10:30)
Sleepy Joe supported China’s entry into the WTO. Michigan lost half of all auto manufacturing jobs. After those Biden betrayals, they also supported the Trans-Pacific partnership, which would have been the death sentence for the U.S. auto industry. I canceled TPP. I ended the NAFTA disaster. And I took the toughest action ever taken against China. We never took in 25 cents on China. I’ve taken in billions and billions of dollars over the last three years.(01:11:07)
Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. They don’t want to write about it. They don’t want to write about it. They’re not allowed to write about it. Their bosses, whoever their bosses may be, they’re not allowed to write about it. Who sold out Michigan to China, he sold you out. That’s one of the reasons when they send over a car, they charge us 35% tax. We charge them nothing, But those days are changed. We changed it. We changed it. And it’s going to change a lot more if you give us another four years. That I can tell you. We were just beginning. We were just beginning.(01:11:45)
And not only with China, with everyone else that takes advantage of our country.:49)
Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!(01:12:02)
Thank you very much. No, but with everybody else it takes it. It’s not only China. It’s everybody. We renegotiated the South Korea deal. You know. Crooked Hillary made that deal. It was going to give 250,000 jobs. She was talking, “This will produce 250,000 jobs.” They signed it and she ended up being correct. But the 250,000 jobs all went to South Korea, not to us. That was standard. That was standard. Biden is the living embodiment of the decrepit and depraved political crass. They got rich bleeding America dry. And you know what happened? Look, there haven’t been too many states that have been affected like you’ve been affected. You got seriously affected.:48)
Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!(01:12:58)
That’s what we’re doing. We’re doing it. We’re doing it. But when I ran, you never told me it was going to be that deep, that vicious, that rough. It’s a deep sucker. I thought we’d knock it out fast. We went through three and a half years of hell and here we are, and they’re not too happy. And they’re reeling. They’re reeling. They’re going to be knocked off very soon. They’re going to be all knocked off very soon.(01:13:28)
No, we’ve done a good job, but it wasn’t easy. You get impeached over a telephone call that was perfect. Perfect call. A perfect call. Congratulations on your victory. Ukraine President, Ukraine, nice man. Never met him before. Congratulations. “Sir, could you call up and congratulate the President of Ukraine?” “Sure. What happened?” “Oh, he just won.” “Okay, good.” So I gave him a call. I avoided it for a long time because it was a lot, you know, busy. Call up and they say, “Let’s impeach him.” I’ll tell you. And we had great support from the Republican party. I have to say that, 197 to nothing and that. 52 and a half to one half. You know who the half was? That’s right. That we had 52 and a half to one half. Mitt Romney. He still doesn’t know why. He say, “Let’s see, what did I do?” He wished he didn’t do it. I’ll tell you that.(01:14:26)
In 2016, Michigan voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as President to finally put America first. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician, probably wouldn’t be here if I was. And if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you. And I fight harder and harder and harder and better than anyone’s ever fought for you. We were brought here. We were put here to fight for you. I had a very easy life before this. I have to tell you.:14)
Thank you, Trump! Thank you, Trump! Thank you, Trump! Thank you, Trump!(01:15:25)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I had a very easy life. I had a different kind of a life and you know what? I wouldn’t have changed that decision when I said, “First Lady, let’s do it. You’re going to be First Lady.” She was actually one of the people. She said, “Are you sure you want to do this?” First Lady, people love the First Lady. They do. They love her. She’s good. She’s elegant and she puts up with a lot from these people, you know, it’s like unbelievable. But she said, “But are you sure you want to do this?” I say, “I think I do. Yeah. I think I do.” She said, “You know you will win if you do it. You must be sure.” And I said, “You think so?” I said, “Do you think so, really?” She said, “No, you will win definitely. But the question is, do you want to do it? And I said, “Yeah, we do. We have to set this nation back on the right course.” That’s right.(01:16:20)
No. She said that. I’ll never forgot that. That was sort of cool. It was just like second nature. You know you’ll win. You’re running against a lot of very talented people. And then we had to run against a very talented crooked machine.(01:16:33)
Joe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media and powerful special interests. You saw that over the last couple of weeks. All the corruption and they refuse to even talk about it. Could you imagine if I got three and a half million from the mayor of Moscow’s wife? Or one of my kids took three and a half million from… Can you imagine that? And they refuse to even discuss it. They don’t want to discuss it. There is no proof. They now say the laptop from hell was produced by Russia. This was Schiff, watermelon head, right? The laptop was produced by Russia. We say, “Oh no, not again.” No, John Ratcliffe came out immediately. He’s great. He’s doing a great job. He said, “It was not produced by Russia,” so. But that’s what they try and do. They do disinformation. They’re the biggest disinformation. I’ll tell you. They own him. They control Biden and they know he will always do whatever they want. They know that. That’s why they want him. I definitely don’t do what they want. I definitely don’t.(01:17:41)
Except I do one thing. I get them good ratings. Can you imagine if they don’t have me? Let’s say they had Biden. Their ratings will collapse. Every one of them will be out of business. There’ll be out of business so fast. They will be out of business so fast. In fact, I think they’re going to get together. The New York Times will die, the failing New York Times. Washington Post, which is basically a lobbyist for Bezos. You know that. But they’ll all get together and they’ll say, “Listen, we made a big mistake here. We got to draft Trump. We got to get him to run again. This is no good. We’re dying. Nobody cares.” Can you imagine then having Biden? we’re going to put something up. Can you imagine having Biden as your President? The biggest loser will be the fake news media. That will be so boring. You know, their ratings are through the roof. Everything’s through the roof. The NFL is doing very badly. You know why? Everyone’s watching politics because they find politics to be much rougher than the NFL. It’s much dirtier and more disgusting. And they don’t change. You know, in the NFL, they change the rules. They make everything like coming back. You can’t touch anybody. Somebody tackles too hard. They say 15 yard penalty and you’re out of the game, and you’re out for the season. You know, in the old days, right? It was a little different, but it’s still tough. But this is much tougher and people see it. But you have to see the ratings. That’s why the ratings are bad for a lot of the sports. Nobody ever thought of this. But I thought of it. A couple of people wrote it. The ratings to bed because so many people are watching this. It’s tougher. It’s true.(01:19:25)
But they’re going to be calling for us, “Please, please run again. We think we’re going to endorse you.” I got endorsed by the Pittsburgh, right, Pittsburgh Post Gazette. I got endorsed, first time since 1972 that they endorsed, right? It’s a big deal. Big newspaper, very good, very liberal newspaper, but that’s okay. But first time since 1972 that they endorsed a Republican, so it’s an honor. And if you don’t read the first two or three paragraphs, it was one of the best endorsements. “Yes. We don’t like him. Yes. He has a horrible personality.” But listen to this. It’s not that I do, but I have been under siege illegally for three and a half years. I’ve been fighting for three and a half years.(01:20:14)
And I said to somebody today, “I wonder what it would be like if the fake Russia hoax and all this crap with the impeachment over nothing.” Over a phone call that was perfect, that was perfect, I wonder what it would be like if we didn’t have all of this horrible stuff. You know, we’d have a very calm situation and maybe I’d be less popular. I don’t know. Maybe I’d be less popular. Because you know what the fact is, people see that we fight. We’re fighting for you. But it’s a really dirty, horrible business. But I said today, because were saying they don’t like the personality and he’s always fighting. I’m fighting to survive. You have to survive. Very few people would have survived. They would have been in the corner. They would have said, “Mommy, mommy,” put their finger in the mouth, put their thumb in the mouth and say, “Mommy, mommy, take me home. I’m out of here. Get me the hell out of here.” They’d say, “Forget about the American people. Mommy. I want out of here right now.”(01:21:16)
No, we can’t do that. But you have to fight hard and then you fight hard and you hit them back. And then they say, “There’s chaos in the White House.” They caused the chaos. We have a great group of people. We have a lot of them here tonight. Great people in the White House. But it’s true. I wonder if it would have been different. We caught them spying on our campaign. We caught them trying to take out a duly elected President of the United States. That’s treason. That’s treason. We caught them. And someday, maybe something’s going to be done about it, too. You know? Maybe. Boy, oh boy, oh boy. We don’t want to do anything prior to the election. Well, what about me? They did it to me before. They spied my campaign before the election. We shouldn’t do anything prior to the election.(01:22:17)
And you know who we caught? Barack Hussein Obama and Sleepy Joe Biden. They were a part of it. We ought to get these reports out. They should get them out before the election as far as I’m concerned. They should get them out right before the election. Should have gotten them out a long time ago. We have information. You wouldn’t even believe it. I don’t even get involved. I always said I’m going to stay uninvolved. Very hard for me to do, I’ll tell you. No, it is because I didn’t have to do that. I thought it’d be the right thing. And yet they did the Mueller report, right? The phony Mueller report, 18 angry Democrats, smart, 18 angry vicious, many of them work for Hillary Clinton, 18 angry Democrats. They spent $48 million. And at the end of two and a half years, no collusion. Okay? Friend of mine said, “You have to be the most innocent of the world.” And they checked everything. They checked taxes. For $48 million, you check taxes. Right?(01:23:15)
And by the way we announced, you know, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes. They didn’t say that. They refuse to say. They say, “Well, prepaying isn’t paying.” I said, “No, it’s prepaying. That’s even worse.” Millions of dollars, many millions of dollars. And that’ll all come out. And you know, when you look at it, when you look at what’s gone on, seriously, think of that. Just think about that tonight when you’re with your family. I wonder if it would’ve been different. I wonder if it would have been a different kind of a feel. And you know what? Honestly, maybe it wouldn’t have been as good. Maybe we wouldn’t have these massive crowds, because you see what somebody is where we’re under siege, and you people get it. You’re smarter than them. You’re smarter than these people. You get it. And you’ve always gotten it and it’s a beautiful thing. And I’ll never forget it. I want to tell you, I’m never going to forget it. But we were under siege and we caught him and it’s treason or whatever you want to call it.(01:24:16)
But with sleepy Joe Biden, they don’t want to write anything. We caught the whole thing. The son. Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? The son was like a human vacuum cleaner. He’d go in and follow his father. “Let’s go to China today, son.” They’d fly it on Air Force Two. Right? I guarantee you one thing. Mike Pence, I know his kids. They don’t do that. They don’t do that. They’re unbelievable kids, military. But you know, “Let’s go to China today, dad. I’d like to follow you.” Walks out with one and a half billion dollars fees. Oh, he must be a great investor. You know, the greatest investors don’t make that deal with China. China doesn’t do that. They don’t give money out for other people that are less smart than them to invest.(01:25:03)
Let’s give our money to somebody that’s not very smart to invest. Okay? That’s a great idea. He walked out. It only took him 10 minutes to get it to $1.5 billion. That’s millions of dollars in fees. The big one was the $10 million. You saw that one, the letter. He wants $10 million a year for introductory purposes. Okay? $10 million. But it all blew up. By that time, the laptop from hell was found. The one that Schiff said was developed in Russia. It’s unbelievable. And then you have Ukraine. He goes into Ukraine. His father was a judge of Ukraine, right? He was a judge of Russia, Ukraine, China, specifically. He goes into Ukraine, $183,000 a month. “Do you have energy experience?” It’s in energy. Right? Burisma. “Do you have energy experience?” “No, I don’t. I don’t know anything about energy.” “Well, we’ll pay you $183,000 a month and we’ll give you an upfront fee of approximately $3 million. Would that be satisfactory?” No. Think of it. No. Think of it. And there are other things, too. Then he’s got the brother and he’s got a whole… This is a corrupt enterprise. And then they had the big man gets 10%. The big man. Who’s the big? He’s not a big man to me. To me, he’s a very meek, fragile, he’s a fragile person.(01:26:22)
And he’s very agitated. I watched him today. He gets more time on Fox. I’ve never seen anybody on Fox so much. Him, they have everybody on Fox. They have all enemies on Fox. I think it’s crazy. But he gets a lot of time on Fox. But he’s so agitated. And now he comes out with the aviator glasses, but they’re a little too small. He wants to look like Tom Cruise from a long time ago. No, but he’s fragile. He’s not going to be there. That’s not what they’re counting on. They’re counting on somebody else. They’re counting on, by far, the most liberal person in the Senate, Kamala. They like her. They like Kamala.(01:27:05)
Every corrupt force in American life that betrayed you and hurt you is supporting Joe Biden. The failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars, they support Biden. The career politicians that offshored your industries and decimated your auto plants, and you suffered for many, many years. I’m telling you, that’s why I’m here, I think, primarily. That was the first thing, trade. I said, “How could they do that?” They supported Biden. The open borders, lobbyists, that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs and gangs and crime that poured into our country, they support Biden. They still do the anti-American radicals, defaming our noble history, heritage and heroes, they support Biden. They support him. They support Sleep Joe.(01:27:56)
And you know, I signed a law that you take down any of our statues, any of our monuments, you go to jail for 10 years. It’s amazing the way it seemed to have stopped. Isn’t it. It’s really amazing. Somebody said, “Oh, it’s just stopped.” No, it didn’t just stop. I took it old law and reactivated it, because the new law, and you go into this with this bunch, with Nancy Pelosi and crying Chuck Schumer, you know what they’ll do? They’ll give you a medal if you rip down the statues. Antifa and the rioters, looters, Marxists, and left wing extremists, they all support Joe Biden. This election comes down to a simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the corrupt and selfish political class? Or do you want to be governed by the American people yourselves? You’re going to govern the way it supposed to be.(01:28:50)
A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalists, and the communists, socialists, and wealthy liberal hypocrites who want to silence, cancel and punish you. Cancel culture they call it, cancel culture. No, thank you. We want to be proud of our history. Good, bad, whatever, we want our history. We want to know. And we want to learn from our history. We don’t want our history canceled. We want to learn. There’s things we have to learn from our history, too.(01:29:23)
If you want your children to be safe, if you want your values to be respected, if you want to be treated with honor, dignity, and respect, then I am asking you to go tomorrow and vote for a person named President Trump. Got to win Michigan. This is a big, important place. If we win Michigan, it’s over. It’s over. We win the whole thing. Four more years and then we can finish the job we started so well. We can finish the job. You know, I got nominated? No, I say it because they don’t write it. I just heard today. I thought it was three. I got four, four Nobel Peace Prizes. Can you believe it? One for the Middle East. One for Kosovo, Serbia. They want to make a trade deal. They’re each fighting each other, for many decades, they’re fighting, killing each other. You’ve read it. I mean, for years, they’re just automatic killing each other for many, many decades. And we’re doing these trade deals with them, not big deals, but they want them very badly. We’re doing them. And they’re each doing them.(01:30:32)
And I said to the people I said, “Listen, we’re doing deals. They want to make the deal with us. Everybody wants to make a deal with us.” I said, “They’re killing each other.” I think, right? They’re killing each other. I read about it. They’re killing each other for decades. “Tell them we’re not making a deal unless they get together and make a peace.” And we told that to them. We’re not interested in doing deals unless you guys can get along and not kill each other. You know, it’s human lives. We don’t know where it is. You don’t know where it is. Some people have never heard of the places, but they’re places. And they’re people. They’re human beings. And I said, “Tell them we’re going to do it, but you have to make peace.” And we got them together, we made peace. And they actually nominated me for the Nobel Peace Prize. I got four nominations in four unrelated things. That’s crazy, right?(01:31:16)
And I told the story, you probably heard about it. The first one I went up, Middle East. You know, the Middle East is coming along. No blood in the sand, no nothing. The Middle East is great. Signed already three countries. We have seven, eight, nine countries. They could all sign. I said, “How did Obama do it?” And they told me and I said, “Good. We’ll do it the opposite.” But not only Obama. For many, many years, they haven’t been able to do it. And I’d like to finish that up, too. We need a little more time, you know. We need a little bit more time. But we have countries lined up, no money and no blood in the sand, no blood in the sand. Remember what I said four years ago, “I am your voice and I will make America great again.” And that’s what we’re doing. That’s what we’re doing.(01:32:05)
Together, we will defeat the corrupt establishment. We will dethrone the failed political class. We will drain the Washington swamp. And we will save the American dream for your children, for your grandchildren. This election is also a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown or a safe vaccine. The vaccine is coming along great, couple of weeks, a couple of weeks. It’s going to be out soon. That ends the pandemic and it will end anyway. They hate it when I say we’re rounding the corner. It’s going to end anyway. But the vaccine will make it go a lot quicker. And what we’ve done with therapeutics is incredible. Excuse me, here I am. But I like to say, no, no. I like to say it had no impact on me. I didn’t really need it. They just happened to give it to me because I’m a perfect physical specimen that’s very young. I’m very young and in perfect physical shape.(01:33:03)
No, but it’s amazing. What we’ve been able to do is incredible, really incredible. We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few weeks and it will quickly eradicate this virus. You know, we’ve learned about it with our senior citizens, especially if they have a condition, a heart condition, they have some problem, any kind of a problem. Boy, it’s vicious. That’s the ones it really goes after. But we’re going to protect our great senior citizens first. And then it’ll go very quickly throughout for anybody that wants it. It won’t be enforced. It’s not going to be enforced. For people that want it, and we’ll get it done. And it’ll all take place very quickly. And by the way, nobody else would have been able to do what we did. You know, nobody else would have been able to do what we did.(01:33:51)
You know, Joe Biden, he handled the Swine Flu. It’s one of the great catastrophes. He was a mess. His own Chief of Staff said, “We had no idea what the hell we were doing.” I don’t know why this guy admitted that. I still, I can’t figure out why he admitted it. Probably before Joe thought he could ever run. You know, Joe thought his career was over because he wasn’t thinking straight. Then he ran and Elizabeth Warren said, “I want to stay until the end and take out Bernie.” You know, she took out Bernie, and we’re running against Joe instead of Bernie, and Bernie is going to run again though in another four years. He’s going to run again. One thing about that guy, he never gives up. Does he? But he’s a hell of a loser. I mean, he loses the first time and he goes back. He’s like, no hard feelings. He loses the second time horribly. The Democrats took advantage of Bernie Sanders and everybody that he represents.(01:34:45)
But they’re looking to take over Joe. They agreed to the manifesto. I call it. You have to see what’s in that one. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state. That’s what he wants, locking you in your home while letting the far left rioters, so the rioters and the looters, the anarchists, Antifa, they can go knock the hell out of your room, your streets, set your stores on fire. No problem. That’s called protesting. We must protect our protesters, but you’re not allowed to go to church, you’re not allowed to have dinner, right? The only one allowed to have dinner in this state is the husband of your Governor. He’s the only one that’s got special privileges. That was not a good day when he got caught boating or whatever the hell he was doing. “Who are you?” “I’m the husband of the Governor.” The police didn’t go for that one too well, did they?(01:35:42)
No, that wasn’t a great day. No, you’ve got to open up your state, Governor. Open it up, Governor. Let the kids go back to school. Let the kids go back to school. It’s like Baron, Barron Trump, right? They said, you know, First Lady had it. I had it. They said, “Sir, you tested positive.” First Lady, they did come to see us [inaudible 00:30:03]. They said, “Sir, Barron, he just,” White House doctor, great doctor, Sean, “Sir, Barron just tested positive.” I said, “Tested positive for what?” “For corona>” you know, it sounds like… See, I like the China virus, or I like the plague from China. But a lot of people use it. Like, it sounds like an island in Italy.(01:36:27)
I said it’s not corona, but just tested positive for corona. I said, “Well, I don’t like that. That’s not good” Barron, you know he’s strong. He’s very tall. He’s only 14 years old and he’s very tall. I can tell, “Hi Barron.” And he’s a good boy. But he just tested positive. And I said, “Wow.” Then about 12 minutes later, I see the doctor. “Doctor, how’s Barron doing?” “Oh, he’s okay. He’s fine now. Took him about 12 seconds to get rid of it.”(01:36:56)
Because they’re young and they have a strong immune system. No, I mean, he got better so fast. And you know what I say? Let the kids go to school. You’re not going to hear that from the other side. They want to lock it up. The Biden lockdown down will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Easter, no Christmas, no 4th of July, no future for the youth. Other than that, it’s going to be a great life. No, you got to let the kids go to school. Get going. Open up your state. It’s time. And you know, we got to take care of our seniors. We have to take care of people. We understand that we have to do things, but let the kids go back. This is a lockdown. This is a shut down. Of course, probably on a date like November 4th, they’ll announce. “Well, we’re going to decide to open up.” Right?(01:37:53)
Did you see the one head of the union said, “Yeah, we want the teachers to go back to work on November 4th.” That was not a good move. She announced, “We want the teachers to go back to November 4th.” Gee, I wonder why that day. Despite that we had the best numbers, look, we have states that are locked down, closed down, New York is having a hard time. I’ll tell you. They don’t know what the hell they’re doing. Great place. I left it three and a half years ago. I loved it. And it’s very sad what’s happening to New York. A very, very sad thing in Chicago. Look at Chicago. It’s very sad. All run by Democrats, by the way, I want to just emphasize.(01:38:28)
How about Portland with the anarchists, right? They’re Antifa anarchists. But how about Portland? We could solve that problem in 25 minutes. Like we did, you know, we went into Seattle. We were ready to go in. We were all set to go in. And we told them we’re going in tomorrow morning. And the night before they said, “Okay, well, we’re leaving now.” That could have been done a long time ago if they asked us. We have to be asked. And we did a great job in Minnesota. We’re going to win Minnesota for two reasons. We’re going to win Minnesota. First time since 1972, we’re going to win Minnesota-(01:39:03)
First time since 1972, we’re going to win Minnesota, you know why? Number one is Ilhan Omar, the fact that she’s there. No, but she loves our country very much, right? She has a great deep and abiding love for our country and the other one, boy, the hatred is just crazy. How do we put up with this stuff, right? I mean, the hatred. But she’s the number one reason and maybe number two is the fact that the National Guard did one hell of a job in Minneapolis. Now they should have called a week and a half earlier, it would have been nice. You wouldn’t have had the fires raging, the anchors that said, “This is a friendly protest,” and behind the anchor it looked like the world was burning down. This is a friendly protest, see because they don’t report the truth. A vote for Biden is a vote for lockdown’s, layoffs, and misery. You got to just get out of this. We can’t play games. Our country has such incredible potential we can’t let this happen.(01:40:02)
This country will never be a socialist nation, okay? And that’s what they want to do. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family and freedom to live the great, great life that you’ve always wanted to have, then go cast your ballot tomorrow for your all time favorite President, I hope, Donald Trump. Remember that Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, a respected guy, he worked with Biden. He said, “Biden has been wrong on nearly every single major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.” Other than that, he spoke very well of him. But you don’t have to believe me, you don’t have to even listen to me because it happens to be Michigan. We spent a hell of a lot of money on that right there, so roll the tape. (01:45:41)
You can’t let that happen, you can’t let happen. This country is so great, we have such potential. We’re just starting to show our potential. If we didn’t get hit with the plague you’d see numbers, but we’re going to do it anyway. Next year, we’re going to do it anyway, it’s going to be incredible. We can’t let that happen, everybody knows it. And if he were a nice guy, he’s never been a nice guy, he’s never been a smart guy, never been smart, everyone knows it, never been smart. But if he was a nice guy, we wouldn’t even do that but that’s just a very small version, that’s not even the bad stuff. And one thing I can tell you, President Xi of China, Putin, Kim Jong-un, these guys are at the top of their game, they can’t have this. Well you don’t want to give them this, we’ll lose our country. We’ll lose our country, we can’t do it, we can’t do it. Biden would be a disaster for cherry growers, farmers, workers, all across your state. You do so many different things.(01:46:40)
Joining us tonight a representative, Jack Bergman. Two great guys. Jack, thank you very much and John Moolenaar. Thank you, John. Thank you, fellas. Great warriors. They’ve been just incredible people. I’ll tell you what, they’ve been with me through everything, right? And we appreciate it. Are you in good shape with your races, you don’t need any additional help? They’re probably about 30 points up. When somebody is good, they’re good. You guys are great, thank you very much. And your next Senator, a tremendous guy, I spotted him a long time, I spotted him. There were five people running a little while ago, a year ago for a seat, frankly, you have somebody there that’s okay.(01:47:32)
But I saw this man and I said, “Roll it back. I want to see that again, John James, right?” And I said, “Wow, what potential.” And then I found out West Point, great student, great helicopter pilot. I’d trust him 100% to pilot my helicopter, I would do that 100%. No, he’s supposed to be a great warrior actually, I got him to run and he got his feet a little wet and then he just took off and I understand you’re doing very well to that poll, John, I hear. You want to come up here? Come here John. Come on over here John. Come on over. He’s a great guy and I hope he’s going to be voted in. You’re doing very well. Come on John.01:48:27)
Mr. President, it’s an honor to have you back in our state. Are we grateful? (01:49:37)
Good guy. Great man. (01:49:47)
That’s a big very important vote you’re casting in addition to our vote, John James, he’s a star. He’s going to be a star and you have somebody that’s very special. And his competition, nobody knows who the hell he is, Peters. You have a great State, Michigan. They say, “Oh, who’s the Senator?” Peters, Peters, “Who the hell is Peters everyone says.” Nobody knows who he is. He’s a puppet for crying Chuck Schumer I guess, that’s about it. Anyway, good luck John James, everyone. You have to do it. Okay. Another great gentlemen, house speaker Lee Chatfield. Good, nice to see you. I hear you’re doing good. And a woman who is special to this part of the world because she headed up our campaign and she kept calling, calling, please one more visit because a Republican hasn’t won Michigan for many, many years, decades, long time. So she’d call, “Please come over,” so I’d do it, “Come over.” Can I do it again? I came so much, I felt like I should become a citizen of your State.(01:51:08)
That could happen, that could happen. But she would just say, “One more time.” So now it’s toward the end, toward the end and I call and I said, “How we doing?” She said, “You’re going to maybe win, but you have to do just one more visit, that’s all.” So I did one more. I wished her well and I said, “Hey, the elections in three days and I want to just thank you for working so hard.” “Thank you very much, I won’t call you again.” I got home and I got a phone call from her. She said, “You need one more time, one more time.” And I came and we ended up, was that sometime? And I started speaking at 1 o’clock in the morning, now it was election day and we had 32,000 people, is that right? We had 32,000 people and I looked and I said, it was 1 in the morning. And Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary came and Bill Clinton came and they all came, the whole group, and it was an emergency because they heard they were going to lose.(01:52:09)
And when they heard that Rhonda called up and she said, “If you came, it’d be good,” because they were all coming it’s like an emergency. Now their visit was at 7 o’clock, which is prime time, they had 500 people. I started speaking at 1 o’clock in the morning, we had 32,000, so it’s now election day. She just got me and she loves your State, I will tell you that. And she was so good, I said, “You know what? We have to pick somebody now to run the RNC,” that’s the Republican National Committee, it’s a big deal. I said, “How about that woman from Michigan?” And I’ll tell you she has done a fantastic job. Rhonda, come on up here. Come on up. You want to talk here? Come here.4)
Thank you Mr. President. Hello Michigan! Lightening struck four years ago and we blew the minds of the media and the world when we delivered Michigan for President Trump, are we ready for lightning to strike twice? (01:53:47)
She did a great job, we all love her, we love her, she’s fantastic. She’s got a spirit like you wouldn’t believe. Thank you Rhonda, very much and for the work. And I think we’re going to have a fantastic day. It’s going to be an incredible day and I never thought I’d say it, but this election is more important than 2016, I never thought I’d say it. This is going to be because we can’t allow this to happen to our country, this will be the most important election in the history of our country. It’s going to set a course, it’s going to go one way or it’s going to go another and if it goes the other way, it’s going to be a terrible thing, it’s going to be a terrible thing. So get out there and vote. We’re going to win this, we’re going to win it, we’re winning all over. They have no idea what’s going on, they have no idea. We see the real numbers and it’s no longer based on polling.(01:54:39)
The early voting is coming, they’re supposed to be way ahead, right? In the early voting, then we catch them on election day, I don’t know, for whatever reason, that’s the way it is. We vote on election day. They’re not way ahead and they’re having a lot of problems and they have emergency calls out to people. It’s going to be very interesting. Let’s do the great red wave, okay? And get that guy in to, John, we need them. We need them in Washington. For decades our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders, but now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories and our troops back home to the good old USA. It’s about time. The troops are coming back. They’re policemen, we were serving as policemen all over the world, we’re policemen, no, it’s not what it’s all about. For 47 years Joe Biden, viciously attacked Black Americans. He called young Black men super predators. To every Black American I am asking you to go out and vote for Donald J. Trump. This is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to jail you and to betray you and nobody’s done it worse than him. I’m fighting for you, I got you criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, great guy, Tim Scott. And funding for historically Black colleges and universities, which were treated extremely badly. Under my leadership we achieved so much, so much. I said that, and I made the statement during debate, nobody saw the debate last week, did you? Nobody? Two weeks ago, it was a good debate. But I said, “Nobody with perhaps the exception of Abraham Lincoln,” a lot of people said, “Could you do the perhaps the exception out, please?” “has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump,” and that’s true. President Trump, all those things and more, and that’s good and you know what? It’s showing up to.(01:57:06)
When you look at Florida, take a look at those numbers tomorrow. And Hispanic, do you see what’s going on with Hispanic? Hispanic numbers in Florida, they’re saying, “What’s going on with Hispanic?” Hispanic Americans love Trump and I love them and I have a long time. The Black community is going to a level that we haven’t seen in a long time. It’s a beautiful thing to watch and they are saying, “What is going on?” This could be something very interesting that you’re going to be watching. You’re going to be watching some very good television tomorrow night. Very good television. Well, you have to say four years ago, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? Remember how it started? This will be a very short evening for Donald Trump. This will be very easy, very short and then they say, ” Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio,” but it wasn’t just that we won by eight points.(01:58:05)
Oh, by the way, Ohio’s doing great too. Then it’s, “Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Donald Trump has won Georgia, he’s won South Carolina. He’s one their firewall, North Carolina and he won it by a lot. What’s going on? Donald Trump has just won Wisconsin. He’s just won Michigan.” And they held Pennsylvania, even though if I lost every vote in the 2%, I still would have won by a lot, they held it. So you and Wisconsin got credit and that’s okay, right? But I just hope Pennsylvania, next time you take credit, so let’s do it a little bit earlier, please. No, we’re going to do fantastically in Pennsylvania but that was one of the most exciting evenings ever. And I think we’re going to duplicate it, I don’t know, could you ever surpass something like that? But we’re going to at least duplicate it and we need it to carry on what we’ve been doing. We’ve brought so many jobs back and all of those plants that we talked about, we have plants.(01:59:18)
You had nothing for 42 years it was just people leaving, nobody coming and now they’re coming back and they’re coming back in droves and the numbers are fantastic. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure Southern border in U.S history. The Biden Harris group would increase refugees from terrorist nations by over 700% and that’s the manifesto that was agreed to with Crazy Bernie. Including from Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, right? You know that. The Biden plan would overwhelm your communities and turn Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the entire Midwest into a refugee camp. You’re talking about tremendous amounts of people coming into our country. We don’t know who they are, we don’t know anything about them. I’m protecting your families in keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of your country if that’s okay with Michigan.(02:00:18)
If that’s okay with Michigan. If it’s okay with you, we put the ban on because we want people to come into our country who are going to love us, who are going to help us, not people that are going to hurt us and blow up buildings. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military, the largest investment in the military we’ve ever made, we have to do it. All made in the USA, a lot of it made right here in your great state, a lot of it. And we now have the greatest equipment anywhere in the world, fighter jets, F35’s, we have the best tanks, we have the best rockets and missiles. We have the hydrosonic missile that goes 7 times faster right now than the fastest missile in the world. If it went by us, we’d say, “What was that?” It would start over there before you could turn your head it would be over. 7 times, think of that, seven times faster, it’s incredible.(02:01:14)
And we have all of these things and our nuclear arsenal now is in tippy top shape and you know what I say? Pray to God we never have to use it. All of it, all of it, all of it. We’re making submarines the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before, we’re doing it all. And when I took over, it was depleted, our military was depleted, we had old fighter jets. You had to go to the desert, it was called the Graveyard for airplanes, right? And you’d strip planes that were sitting in the desert rotting in the desert and you’d bring the parts back. This was what we were flying in our airplanes. Now we have new tankers, we have the new super fighters. It’s incredible what we’ve done and much of it’s already here, much of it’s coming, but it’s all made in our great country. We just passed the VA choice in VA accountability and nobody thought that could be done and we just got, as I told you, 91% approval from our vets, our great vets.(02:02:15)
We obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate, people don’t talk about that. When I took over, it was a mess. It was all over the place, we obliterated it. We killed the leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. And we eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani is dead. I recognized the capital of Israel and open the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, they were working on that for 52 years. And instead of endless wars we’re forging peace all over the Middle East, they’re all getting together, they’re all getting together. A vote for me and the Republican party and John James and everybody, it’s a vote for the American dream and in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all, that’s already started. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help we will defend the right to life, religious liberty.(02:03:35)
You better get out there and vote. And we will defend keep and bear arms, you know keep and bear arms? It’s called the Second Amendment, which is under siege constantly. That’s where we need John and everybody to help us and our great congressmen, they’ve been so great and we appreciate it. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, lower drug prices beyond any levels you’ve ever seen, 60, 70, 80%. I’ve instituted favored nations that drug companies do not like me, they do not like me. They’re taking out more commercials, I think, than sleepy Joe, but we’re going to get it done. Our prices are the highest in the world for many years by far and we’re bringing them down to the lowest price anywhere in the world, matching the lowest price. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars.(02:04:51)
We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. And we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For Years, you had a President who apologized for America, now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Michigan. Tomorrow you have the power with your vote to save America, you are going to save America. It’s the most important election, I say it all the time. This is the most important election our nation has ever had, I really believe that, never thought I would have said that in a million years, if you go back four years. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get your boss and drag them out and say, ” Boss, come on, you got to get out and vote.”(02:06:03)
Get out and vote, so important. The red wave, I talk about it. The red wave, I think, is going to be far bigger. Look at all of these organic things that form in Iowa and the farm country, tractors, thousands and thousands of tractors. Yesterday didn’t they have 100 miles of cars? It was 100 miles. All over the country 4, 5, 6,000 boats with Trump, Trump and the American flags all over. Never happened. A movement like this has never happened before, it’s never happened and we have to keep it going and finish it out. From Midland to Mackinaw, from Lansing to Grand Rapids, and you know where my last stop is going to be? I’m sorry to tell you that, I feel a little guilty, but Grand Rapids was where we did that final great stop, Grand Rapids. And so, I’m going to be in Grand Rapids. It’s going to be my last stop. There’s something nice about that, right?(02:07:02)
Because you can believe it, I have five of these today and they’re all big monsters. I had five of these today, but I actually had six because yesterday in Miami, we left the stage at 1:30 in the morning. So somebody said, “If you want,” they said, “so if you want, you can say you did six today.” I think I’m going to say that. Nobody else could do six of these, you think it’s easy up here? It’s not easy. It’s freezing up here too. I got the wind, you don’t have that. I have the wind, I’m freezing my ass off up here, only for Michigan and from Battle Creek and right here in Traverse City, it’s a good place, right? It’s good a place. We inherit the legacy of American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, right? (02:08:07)
Raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come. The best is yet to come. The best is yet to come and I made that. Proud citizens like you help build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we’re going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Michigan, we have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Michigan. Go out and vote. Thank you very much."

Thank you very much and hello, Kenosha. It’s nice to be back. It’s nice to be back. We spent a little time with you, a little law and order. We brought law and order to Kenosha. Right? That’s what we want. And hello, Wisconsin. Big day, tomorrow, big, big day, big day. And I think we’re going to do very well in Wisconsin just like we did four years ago. And it’s an honor to be with you. Thank you. (01:51)
And this is a lot of people. This is a lot of people. See, you know what that means? That means we don’t have to pay for the microphones because they did a bad job. Tomorrow, we are going to win this state and we are going to win four more years in the White House. And with your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our police, support our great military, protect your second amendment. It’s under siege, but don’t worry about it, unless sleepy Joe got in, then you can forget about your second amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA.(02:46)
Next year we will be, and you know, we’re going to be together next year. We’re going to be together for four more years and we’re going to be together forever because we’re doing things that nobody’s ever done and we’re doing them together. And it was my pleasure to be with you a number of months ago when you were in the news, right? You were in the news. (03:20)
Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. And I hope you can hear. Can you hear it back there by the way? (03:34)
Yes, no? (03:38)
Hold it. Okay. That was the problem. You got to get the microphones fixed. (03:48)
What’s wrong here? How’s that? Is that getting better? And they was supposed to pay these people, right? No. Is that better? Come on. Okay. We’ll do this. We’ll have to improvise, you know? Sometimes you have to improvise. Okay. You ready? Which is better, this one or this one? Which one? This one. Is that better? Can you hear? This could be a very uncomfortable evening for me. All right. We’ll figure this out. Come on. Let’s go. Good job fellers. I’m always saying I want a perfect mic. Good job. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Is that better now? (05:12)
So this is the first time I’ve ever used a head held for an hour, two hours, three hours. No, we have one more tonight. After this, Grand Rapids. We finish up at Grand Rapids and we finished up there four years ago, and a little bit superstitious. Let’s do it the same way. We came here. We came to grand Rapids. Let’s keep it going. And I hope everyone can hear me now. Yes? Yeah? All the way back there. All the way back. Good. You let me know. You’re not shy. I was wondering. Everyone’s going, I thought they didn’t like me, I was saying. I’m not sure. I said, “What’s going on over here?” Right? Good. Thank you very much.(05:53)
So under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded, 33.1%, fastest every recorded. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months. That’s a record. And while foreign nations are in free fall, we are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they’re better off today than they were four years ago. That’s under the auspices of Barack Hussein and sleepy Joe Biden.(06:39)
You’re not going to want to have Joe Biden. You know, see the media. Look at all the media back there. If they had to cover him for two months, they’d say, “We have to bring the President back. We have to bring Trump back.” They would be out of business. They would be out of business. If Biden, Harris and the radical left gain power, they will collapse our economy and send your nation, this wonderful nation, into a depression. This is the only guy I’ve ever seen who runs by saying, “We will,” he doesn’t say it like that. He goes, “We will.” “We will raise your taxes.” I never heard that before. You know, I’ve covered politicians. I’ve been friends with politicians. I’ve been enemies also, but I’ve never seen somebody saying we will raise your taxes. They want to give you the largest tax increase in the history of our country, and we can’t let that happen. We can’t let that happen.(07:42)
So get out and vote. Tomorrow will be, I think, will be the most important election in the history of our country, and I never thought I’d say that. I never thought I’d say it. So get out and vote. Sleepy Joe Biden will raise your taxes $4 trillion, massively increase your regulations, shut down your farms, close down your factories… How’s he doing so far? Send your jobs overseas, they started booing him. I don’t know. Is this guy really thinking about, I mean, could he really win? Are we serious about this? What the hell is going on? Is he serious? Guy has no clue. He’s shot. Some people are shot. He’s shot. Did you see him today with the aviators, right, the glasses, right? Came on very tough. He’s very agitated. You know, it’s like sort of like going crazy. Destroy the suburbs, dissolve your borders, terminate religious liberty, outlaw private healthcare, confiscate your guns. Second amendment is in deep trouble. Not with me it’s not. You notice it hasn’t been touched. Right? It hasn’t been touched. You think that was easy? It wasn’t easy. And indoctrinate your children with anti-American lies.(09:15)
So I just signed an executive order to teach our students pro-American values, pro-American values. Biden has vowed to abolish the American oil and natural gas industries and ban fracking. Now, from your standpoint, you don’t like it because you don’t want energy costs going up, right? That’s what he’d do. Biden’s energy ban will send every state into crushing poverty from Wisconsin to Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania. As long as I am President, we’ll remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And we are right now. And we will remain energy independent. You know, we’re energy independent. We don’t need foreign nations anymore, but we have good relationships in the Middle East.(10:07)
You know where we’re doing peace in the Middle East. Do you believe it? No blood in the sand, peace in the Middle East. Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure on foreign Wars. You know what they call them? The endless foreign wars, countries that many of you have never heard about. What? (11:08)
I don’t know. I think we’re doing fine with this mic, right? I don’t want to put this guy under pressure. You’re on stage. You got 27,000 people watching. Don’t get nervous. Oh, he’s not nervous. He’s a professional. I’ll give you the name of his company. Never use that company. No, he’s fine. Don’t worry about it. This is okay. This isn’t. Oh, you want to just put it in there? Well, is it the same mic as the other one? It’s a different mic. That means that one’s supposed to be better, right? That’s not good. All right. Okay. We’ll take that sucker out of there. Right? Congratulations. Go ahead. Do you want to put it in? How’s he doing? He’s doing a good job, right? Come on. (12:08)
[inaudible 00:12:08] Now we’re back where we started. See? The whole deal. We’re right back where we started. I take the mic out. Okay. Okay. You know what? And then I won’t pay the bill of the company that does this crazy microphone. And they’ll do a story, “Trump is a horrible human being. He doesn’t pay bills.” No, I don’t like to pay bills when people do a bad job. You don’t either. But I don’t know. They look like nice people. They come from Kenosha. So I’m going to pay the bill anyway. What the hell? You know? Well, at least I proved one thing. You know, did you ever see where I lift the glass of water and I wear the red tie. They’re sort of expensive. And you know, you don’t like to spill water on the red tie. Right? So sometimes I’ll use two hands because I want to catch the water, because I want to save the time because I’m basically cheap, you know? So I’ll take the water and I’ll go like this, and I’ll take a little sip and they’ll say, “There’s something wrong with him.” No, I’m trying to save.(13:14)
So I go like this. So now, by holding a mic all night long like this, you’re going to say, “Well, there’s nothing wrong with that right hand or left hand.” No, did you ever hear that? There’s something wrong. He can’t lift a glass of water. No, I have no problem with it. Some day I may, like Joe, but I don’t have any problem.(13:32)
Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. Think of it. You lost half of your manufacturing jobs after the betrayals. These were betrayals by a lot of people and Biden was one of them. He’s a corrupt politician and he sold out Wisconsin to China. But he’s a corrupt politician and these people never told you that, and they don’t want to write about it, and big tech doesn’t want to talk about it, and it’s off bounds, and they’re not allowed to talk, and we have suppression. We have suppression. This is a media suppression, the likes of which nobody has ever seen. And if you take a look, you’ve never seen anything like it… The last famous last words. Right? But no, nobody’s ever seen anything like it.(14:24)
You know, his son walks in. His son had no job. He left the military. Unfortunately, it wasn’t good. And then what happens is the father becomes Vice President, and this kid becomes like a human vacuum cleaner. He follows the father into countries. “Dad, who are you going to today?” “Well, let’s go to China.” And he’s a vacuum cleaner. Follows the father, takes in money. Right? It’s terrible. They give him one and a half billion dollars, one and a half billion. Think of it, one and a half billion dollars, and he gets fees off that, millions of dollars a year. There’s only one problem. He has no experience investing money. They give him the money. They gave him the money after 10 minutes. I think our Congress has to take a look at that. What do you think, fellas? I think you’re going to have to look at it.(15:12)
Can you imagine? You know, I have a lot of my kids here tonight. Could you imagine if my kids said, “Yeah, dad, I got a billion and a half dollars from China.” Oh, I don’t think they’d want to write about that, the fake news. Do you think they’d write about that? Then he gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow’s wife. Right? What did he get that for? Remember I asked that at the debate, the first debate, I said it. Chris Wallace thought it was an inappropriate question. Really? I think. You think? Chris Wallace. No, I must tell you. I think Kristen did a better job, Kristen Welker. Right? And I don’t mean she was perfect. Actually, some people said she wasn’t really very nice. I thought she was nice. Relatively speaking, she was great for what I got.(15:57)
How about the one, Savannah Guthrie. You see that one? That was another beautiful. Live at nine o’clock, she’s jumping out of a chair. She’s like going crazy. But we all do well. You know, I don’t get questions like he gets. He gets, “Sir, what kind of ice cream are you eating?” Did you see that? They never asked me questions like that.(16:18)
In 2016, Wisconsin voted to fire this corrupt, and really it’s like corrupt, corrupt political establishment. Right? And you elected an outsider as President who is finally putting America first, finally putting America first. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. Right? If I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you, and nobody has ever fought harder for you than I am. I will tell you. Nobody.(17:03)
When the violent mob came to Kenosha, Biden opposed sending in the National Guard. Of course you remember this, right? He didn’t want to send in the Guard. He thought it was terrible to send in the Guard. And we sent in the Guard and we saved Kenosha. We saved Kenosha. I said, “You know, I think Kenosha is going to like me.” We did a good job. I wish they sent them in a little bit earlier. Right? If we had them in a little bit earlier, but that’s okay. That’s okay. But we sent in and how good did the Guard do though? Did we do the job? Did they do the job?(17:41)
Biden and Kamala, does anybody know who Kamala is? This wonderful woman, she wants to be your first female president. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. You know, that’s a good reason not to vote for sleepy Joe, too. Right? You don’t want to do that. We all want to see that happen someday, but we don’t want this to be the one. Right. But they’re waging war on our police. You know that. We have a lot of police here tonight. I recognize it because I went and I met all of the police. I met a lot of great police, federal police. I’ve met the whole group and you have great police. (18:31)
I agree with that. But I stand with the heroes of law enforcement and I was honored to be endorsed by Kenosha County Sheriff, David Beth. Thank you, David, wherever you may be. Where’s David? Thank you, David. That was so nice. That was so nice. They like you out there, David. That’s very good. Appreciate it, David. Thank you very much. And as I’m sure you’ve heard, Biden’s far left supporters are threatening to loot and riot tomorrow if they don’t get their way, if they don’t get their way. Are we-(19:03)
… if they don’t get their way, if they don’t get their way. Are we all ready, David? Everybody ready? If they know we’re ready and if they know we’re not playing games, they won’t even be here. They won’t show up. It’s like I brought an old law into existence when I saw them going around all over the country, knocking down statues and monuments. And we signed, we brought it in, and I signed it, updated it, signed it 10 years in prison if you knocked down a statue or monument. And you don’t see it anymore. They look and they say, “Oh, we’d like to knock that one down, but you know what, 10 years is too much, darling. Let’s leave now.” This is yet more evidence why the radical left cannot be trusted with power. We strongly condemn political violence. We condemn it and we condemn it strongly.(19:51)
Biden must tell his supporters. He doesn’t really have supporters, let’s face it. He doesn’t have supporters. They got shot. He doesn’t have. There’s an ideology that has supporters and he’s just the vessel. He happened to be the one that got through, because Elizabeth Warren instead of getting out like she should have and letting Bernie take it. Bernie, I’ve got to tell you, he is a great loser. He really is. He loses. It happened with Hillary and it had happened with Elizabeth Warren. What she did was incredible. That’s a similar philosophy. But Biden ended up being there. Biden ended up being there and that’s the way it is, and he has to tell his supporters. And I think you’re going to see something. Look at the people over here. They go, “Oh, hello.” Can you actually hear this? Can you hear this?(20:46)
Because this is the worst microphone I’ve ever used in my life. Can you actually hear me over there? They can. In the back, all the way back. That’s good. Thank you. I can’t believe it. It sounds terrible to me. It doesn’t sound great, right? To me, it doesn’t sound great. It’s all right. Good. You know what? Keep saying it. That Bill, he says, “Don’t pay him. Don’t pay him.” Did you hear that, Johnny? Don’t pay the damn bill, would you please? A piece of garbage they gave me. It’s not even the first rate mic. The good one, it’s put to rest. We put it the rest. The good one, we put the rest. All right, don’t pay him. But as President, I will ensure peace and order in this country. We are going to have peace and order. And you’re going to have a day tomorrow the likes of which I think people haven’t seen in a long time, a long time. You’re going to have a red way. It’s going to be a beautiful sight.(21:49)
And you know what? We actually have a country that outside of a radical group, and this is a radical group, but we have a country that’s very well united. When you look at a group of people like this, it’s incredible. And I go from here, I go I told you, Grand Rapids. They say they have 40,000, 50,000 people in Grand Rapids. Last night in Florida, we had 45,000 people. No problem. Everybody’s in love. Everybody loves our country. It’s a beautiful thing. I’m telling you, there’s a lot of unity. We just don’t complain. We don’t complain, we just go out and do what we have to do. But you know, when we were having that incredible run, we were doing the best, and now we’re almost at that same point, and we’ll be there soon. But our country was uniting. We were getting calls. We had the best employment numbers ever African American, Asian American, Hispanic American. And we were getting calls like, “Maybe it’s time we get together.:(22:50)
Because success brings people together. Success brings people together, and you’re going to see that happening, because we’re having numbers the likes of which we’ve never had before. Think of it, 33.1%. Nobody’s ever had that. The highest was 1952, and it was less than half of that number. So rioting, looting, and arson will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I’m just telling you that right now. I’m telling you that right now, that if people are, I hate to see where they put boards up on a window, this shouldn’t be that, it shouldn’t be that, but we are a country of law and order. We have to be. We are. And do you notice, I hate to say it, but it’s true, these are Democrat mayors and governors, there are Democrat run cities and states. They’re the ones, if you look at New York and Chicago, and how about Portland, which is anarchists? We could solve that problem.(23:58)
We tell the Governor, “You want us to solve the problem? We solve it in 30 minutes.” We solved it in Seattle. We went in, we were going to go in the morning, we announced we’re going in, in the morning, and they just raised their hands and they left the night before. And we did a great job in Minneapolis. We did a great job. We’re going to win Minnesota for two reasons. We did a great job. Now, they could have called. They could have let us do it a week and a half early. That would have been nice, so that the announcer, remember the anchor, you looked over, he says, “This is a peaceful protest.”ible 00:00:24:36].(24:48)
Thank you. What a group, what a group. What a group. I’ve gotten to know this state very well. You surprised. You’re the one that put us over the top, you know that, right? Remember? We were waiting for Pennsylvania, four years ago, we’re waiting for Pennsylvania. They didn’t want to call it. Oh, they were going crazy, these people. They were crying. They didn’t know what the hell was happening. They said, “This will be a very short evening for Donald Trump.” Four years ago, right? And they were just, oh, they were looking forward. Remember the woman crying in the convention center, that beautiful? Remember the woman, she was going crazy, glasses, her head’s going? I wonder where she is right now. They put her away. No, no. This was not a person that I was easily going to convince to be on my side I think. She was going crazy. But remember at the beginning, they show everyone’s happy, everyone’s thrilled? They spent a fortune.(25:45)
It was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen in terms of a stage. They had it shaped like the United States. Hello, Becca. Are you okay? But that was a hell of an evening. And this evening is going to be, I’m telling you, tomorrow, it’s going to be, I can’t say bigger. Was there ever anything as big? I’ll tell you, the election is more important, but the evening will be as good or almost as good. And that’s okay too. But that was a first, right? That was a first. That was some evening. That was some evening. “He won Florida. He won Ohio. He won it all.”re years! Four more years! Four more years!(26:29)
Thank you.re years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!(26:38)
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And because of the microphone, we are giving you back half of your admission price. But considering that you paid nothing, I’m sorry, you’re getting nothing. The price is right. Nah, it’s fine. But wasn’t that something though where they say, the evening begins and they say, “This is going to be very quick.” You know what happened? They did exit polls and a lot of the people said, “None of your business.” “Oh, who did you vote for?” “None of your business.” That meant Trump. And they did 44%. You know that, 44% of the people said none of your business? And that meant Trump. They call it the none of your business vote. But almost all of them, I think maybe all of them, were Trump so they didn’t count him. So they said, “Oh, this is going to be a blowout tonight.” But they didn’t realize.(27:34)
These pollsters haven’t been doing so good with me, and we blew it out. It was incredible. It started with Ohio. Remember? We’re going to do great in Ohio tomorrow too, by the way. Great place. “Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. That’s a big state.” I heard for a year while we were doing this, “You cannot win unless you win the state of Ohio.” Every night they did it. And then all of a sudden poll numbers started coming out that I was leading in Ohio. But anyway, they thought I was going to win by one point. I won by eight. They said, “He won Ohio. He won by eight points. What the hell is going on here? That’s a lot.” And then they said, “Oh no. Oh no, please don’t tell me this. Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. No, no, no, no. Please, please, please, please.” Remember Martha Raddatz, ABC? “Oh my God. Oh please. Please don’t tell me this. Oh no, I’m a neutral. I’m very neutral. I don’t do it. Please.”(28:35)
Martha, you’re neutral? Please, the tears, wipe them away quickly. No. Then we won Florida. Then we won Georgia. Then we won South Carolina. Then we won the firewall, was remember North Carolina? That’s their firewall. We were going to win North Carolina. They put so much money into North Carolina, but we had an asset from North Carolina named Lara. Lara, Lara Trump, married to married to the legendary Eric Trump. Where are you? Are you two there? We had a big asset there, Lara Trump. And she knew that area so well and they loved her so much. They loved her so much. And they just had another baby and they named the baby Carolina. They named the baby Carolina. And I tell you though, but I said, “We have to give South Carolina some credit too for that.”hem up. Bring them up.(29:43)
Bring them up. Come on up. Get over here. Come on. Bring them up. Bring them up. Great. Come on, come on, Lara. This one, they love her in North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania. And they love her in Wisconsin too. Here you go.God. I’m done now apparently. Wisconsin, who here is ready for four more years? A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for freedom. A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for the future. A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for God. And a vote for Donald Trump is a vote for America. How do you guys feel? Are we going to win Wisconsin? Let’s go do this a second time. Thank you.(30:54)
Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you, honey. Thanks, Eric. Thanks, sweetheart. They’re doing a good job. They’re working hard, I’ll tell you. They’re all working hard. They’re all working hard. We have a whole group of family. This is like a family reunion tonight. Well, this is now the big time, because tomorrow’s the big day and we have one more stop. Actually, I did five today, but I could say I did six, because in Miami we finished at close to two o’clock in the morning. So let’s add that sixth today after Grand Rapids. Joe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media, and powerful special interests. You know that. They own him, they control him, and they know he will always do their bidding. And when he raises $300 million for this campaign in a short period of time ask him, what deals did you have to make? Because I would be the greatest fundraiser of all time. I can call the Wall Street guys, I know them all I could say, ” Send me $25 million immediately, please.” “Yes, sir, Mr. President. I will.”(32:05)
But once you do that, you’re totally compromised. You can’t do anything properly once you do that. And I say, “I don’t want to do that.” And we did very well with the fundraising stuff, but a lot of it came in small donations. First time a Republican has ever raised a lot of money with small donations. $61 average or something like that. Every corrupt force in American life has betrayed you and hurt you, and they’re all supported by Joe Biden. The failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars, they’re supported by Sleepy Joe Biden. The career politicians that offshored your industries. And you had plenty off shore, and decimated your factories, they support Joe Biden. The open borders lobbyists, all the people that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs, gangs, and crime, and you know a lot about that, they support Joe Biden. The anti-American radicals defaming our noble history, heritage, and heroes, they support Joe Biden. That’s cancel culture. We don’t believe in cancel culture, do we?(33:22)
Antifa and the rioters and looters and Marxists and left-wing extremists, they all support Joe Biden. This election comes down to a simple choice, do you want to be ruled by the corrupt and selfish political class or do you want to be governed by the American people? That’s what it’s all about. It’s the American people. They’ve taken that away. They’ve taken it away, and what’s going on with big tech and what’s going on with the media, nobody has ever seen anything like it. There’s never been anything like it. Nobody has seen anything like it, where you can’t have a scandal if there’s nothing written about it. It’s a pretty [inaudible 00:34:08]. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalist and communists and socialists and wealthy liberal hypocrites, hypocrites who want to silence, censor, cancel, and punish you. These are real, real trouble.(34:27)
If you want your children to be safe, if you want your values to be respected, if you want to be just treated with dignity and respect, then I am asking you tomorrow to go out and vote for your all time favorite President, because we still have work to do.re years! Four more years! Four more years!(35:07)
Thank you.re years! Four more years!(35:12)
Thank you. Remember what I said four years ago, I am your voice and we will all together make America great again. That’s what we’re doing. It’s what we’ve done. For the last four years, the depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me. Can you imagine if they didn’t do the hoax. The Russia hoax? Russia, Russia, Russia. How about Schiff getting up the other day, the laptop from hell, right? Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? Is Hunter here? Where’s Hunter? Oh, he’s in a country. I see, his father just left the country. He’s going to scam them for a couple of bucks. Where is Hunter? No, but he’s got the laptop from hell and Schiff got up with the watermelon head, like I want a watermelon, and he goes, “This was produced by Russia.” These people are crazy, I tell you. Ay yi yi, what a crazy bunch. But they know I don’t answer to them, I answer to you. It’s true.(36:13)
Look, I didn’t need this. I didn’t need this. I had a very nice life. I had a very nice life, but you know what? It’s the greatest thing I ever did, because no administration, no President in the first three and a half years, the biggest tax cut in history, the biggest regulation cuts, rebuilding our military, look at what we’ve done, look at what we’ve done. Our vets just gave a 91% approval rating. The highest in history, the highest in history. No, look at what we’ve done. Space Force, I never even talked about Space Force. I never talked. I realized we needed it after I was in office. I looked, I saw. I saw a rush. I saw China. I said, “We need Space Force.” First time in 74 years, new one, right? A new one, right, Congressman? We did a great job on it. Together we will defeat the corrupt establishment, we will dethrone the failed political class, we will drain the Washington swamp, and we will save the American dream, a dream for your children, your grandchildren, a dream for your children and your grandchildren.(37:26)
We have the energy and the people to prove the corrupt media wrong. And that’s what we have, we have an energy like no movement has ever had in this country. Somebody would go in and do well in New Hampshire, as an example. I’m thinking about one man, because I have a lot of respect for him, he did well. Came in second in a primary and he became famous for many years. What we did is we won all the primaries, we won everything, and then we won the Presidency. No, there’s never been a movement like this. And now they go after us illegally. They spied on our campaign.(38:03)
Now they go after us illegally, they spied on our campaign. Our campaign, it’s not my … our campaign. They tried to take out a duly elected President of the United States and we caught them, and we caught them and let’s see what happens to them. And you know who was a part of it? Barack Hussein Obama. (38:22)
And sleepy Joe Biden and plenty of others, like Comey, et cetera, but plenty of others, but they were a part of it. So now we’ll see what happens, right? We’re going to see, we’re going to see what happens. So, but you have to get out and vote, this is the biggest thing, get out and vote. By the way, who’s already voted? All right, that’s not … but we have a tendency to vote on election day, republicans. So let me ask you, who is planning to vote tomorrow? Very important, very important. Is anybody planning to vote for sleepy Joe Biden, please raise your hand? Does anybody have the courage? Raise your hand. No, all right, yeah, get out and vote. Well, that’s good, that’s a lot of people. So a lot of you vote a little bit early then? Do you trust the ballot system? Do you do early voting or do you do the ballot? Early, I like early better, early as good. Early is good, ballot is not good. We got a very horrible, horrible ruling from the Supreme Court of the United States, a ruling that puts our country in danger, actually. On Pennsylvania, they have so much time to do this thing. Oh, let them put their votes in and give them plenty of time. We have a date, it’s called November 3rd. We don’t have a date that says, many days later. We don’t have a date that says you’re allowed to go and start putting your vote in later. And we can tabulate it later, take your time. The whole world is waiting to find out and there’s great danger in that, number one, there’s danger that there’s a lot of shenanigans that go on from that time forth. There’s a lot of shenanigans. And then there’s a lot of bad things that can happen with the streets. I mean, you’re going to have a population that’s going to be very, very angry, and you just can’t do that. That is such a dangerous decision. That is such a disappointment when I heard that decision. That’s a terrible decision, just you go take a look at it. And I know you people are taking a look at it, but there’s not a decision that I’ve ever heard of like that.(40:27)
Where people … if you want to put your ballot in, and if you wanted to … you go and you put it into a three or four weeks early. You don’t go and put your … he said, you had a whole year, you had a lot of time. You had a lot of time. So they say, “Oh, this is so terrible.” They gave them extra time and then all the time. So now we’re going to be all waiting around because Pennsylvania … we’re going to win Pennsylvania, it’s a great state. But you know it’s in like you, it’s in a total shutdown, they shut it down. The governor is a Democrat, he shut it down. It’ll probably open on the 4th. It’ll open … He’ll announce, “Ladies and gentlemen now that the election’s over, we’re going to open it up.” Right? But you can’t do that. That’s a very, very dangerous decision by the Supreme Court. I guess it was a political decision. I don’t know what it was. I don’t know what they were thinking.(41:17)
And you know what, maybe I should, maybe I shouldn’t be speaking this way. I’m very disappointed on behalf of this country that a thing like this could happen. Because we could be waiting for weeks before we ever find out what’s going on. The whole world is waiting for this decision. It’s a very sad, it’s a very sad thing. And hopefully it’s going to be changed. Hopefully, their wisdom … and they have wisdom. Hopefully their wisdom will prevail and they’ll do something. And lawyers will be going in and there’ll be fighting. But people, in fact, it’s all over television tonight. I’m coming from place to place, and the good thing about Air Force One, it’s got more televisions then any hotel room in the world, okay? You have him on the floors you have on the ceilings, you have them all over.(42:02)
And you see the comments that are being made about the decision. And some of the pros are saying, this is a very dangerous decision for our country because so many things, I mean, they’re going to say, well, how many votes short are we? We need 6,000 votes. Well, let’s take 6,000 of these. We’ll put them over here. Let’s take 6,000 of these. It’s going to be cheating. It’s going to be cheating. It’s like, they’re putting these people … and you know what, we don’t consider the people that have been running elections in Philadelphia to be very honest. We’ve had a lot of problems with Philadelphia. So that’s the story and hopefully that’ll be changed. And I’m sure the people would say, “Oh, you shouldn’t speak that way about the Supreme Court.” We’ve had so many bad decisions out of the Supreme Court that I will speak that way and that’s the way it is.(42:49)
This election is also a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown and a safe vaccine that ends … and by the way, we’re rounding the turn anyway, but we have great vaccines. We have great vaccines coming. We have great vaccines coming and it’s a lot of good things are happening. And when you look at the therapeutics, excuse me, here I am. I’m right here. No, I don’t think the therapeutic helped me. I don’t think I needed it. I’m glad I got it, right? Regeneron, we’re going to make it available free to anybody that needs it. We’re making it available free to anybody that needs it, free. But I’ll tell you what, I’m sure I didn’t because I’m a perfect physical specimen. And I am considered very, very young. I’m considered young for my age. No, I’m a perfect specimen. I’m in perfect shape. So I’m sure I would have thrown it away.(43:45)
But no, but I had it and the next morning I was not feeling good at all, I tell you. The doctor said, “Sir, I hate to say it. You’ve just tested positive.” I said, “Doc,” Sean, a great doctor, White House doctor. I said, “Sean, tell me, what does that mean? Tested positive for what?” “Sir you tested positive for the China plague.” No, he used it much nicer, he said, “COVID.” He said, “COVID.” It’s got about 37 names, you know that we could name it. I always like to have a China in there because I like to be accurate. But, but he said, “Sir, you have tested positive for COVID.” I said, “I’m in the middle of the campaign, I can’t be positive for COVID.” And so, anyway, so I was, and I didn’t feel too good. And the First Lady had it, at least now you know that all those rumors is that she lives in Virginia separate, I mean, at least now you know she lives in the White House. Because she got it probably from me or whatever, I don’t know, what the hell?(44:47)
Do you ever hear, the First Lady lives in Virginia in a beautiful house over a river or something. No, no, she lives … but at least that. I know people love the First Lady, they love the First Lady. It’s true. They love the First Lady, it’s true, they love her. She’s doing a good job. They love … the whole family back there, they love that family back there. Great family, hi, Tiffany. So, Melania has it but she knocked it out pretty good. And I did a great job. I was surrounded by these doctors, 12 doctors, I’ve told this story, each one was a specialist. Johns Hopkins, Walter Reed Medical Center is incredible, that’s our military center, it’s incredible. And I’m surrounded, right? I’m just surrounded by these brilliant doctors. One thing when you’re president, you get a lot of doctors. And each doctor grabbed a different part of my body. And I said, “I don’t like this at all.”(45:52)
But they told me about this one thing. And I said, “I really do, I like it. I really …” but it was very, a little bit early. What we’ve done with getting it through the FDA has been incredible. Biden wouldn’t have this stuff done for years. Well, he had a chance with this swine flu and totally blew it, right? It was a disaster. It was a disaster. Anyway, so I wake up the next morning and I’m telling you, I felt like Superman. I wanted to get out. I said, “Give me another trade deal to renegotiate that these clowns have screwed up. Gave me a trade deal to renegotiate. And where am I supposed to be?” “Well, sir, could you take it easy for a couple of days?” And people are sort of amazed. I’ve done these things, I mean, I do them. These are not easy to do, especially when you have no damn microphone. I mean, I’m working harder on this one than I have on all six that I did today. This is the hardest one. Because I have a microphone that was obviously meant for congressmen and senators, not for a president.(46:56)
So it’s a little bit off, but that’s okay. You have to learn how to … Isn’t that funny when he put it back in here and handed it to me, I said, “But that’s the way we started.” I thought that was better. Nobody got that, only this front row got that one. I thought that was very clever, actually. But then he came up to me, the doctor, Sean, he said, “Sir, I’m sorry to inform you that your son, Barron has tested positive.” Again, I said brilliantly, “For what?” He said, “For COVID.” I said, “Oh, that’s terrible.” “Oh no, he’ll be okay, sir, he’ll be okay.” I said, “It’s terrible.” But he’s young and he’s strong and he’s very tall. Have you ever seen … I say, “Hi, Barron.” 14 years old, he’s very tall. He’s definitely tall and he’s strong, but he’s young. And I said, “That’s terrible.” He said, “No, he’ll be okay, sir, he’ll be okay.” And I said, “Well, I hope.” Like 12 minutes later I say, “How’s Barron doing Doctor?” “Sir, he’s 100% now, he’s …” Get your kids back to school, okay. Right, get them back to school. Yeah, all right. So we’re going to mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks. It’s going to be coming out very soon and we will quickly eradicate the virus. Wipe out the China plague once and for all, get it the hell out of here. We will never forget either. We will not forget. That was not good. You know, we made a great trade deal with China as you know very well. But you know the ink wasn’t dry before we got this and no good, no good. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state, locking you in your home while your far left anarchists are allowed to roam the streets, burn down your cities, hit people over the head. They’re allowed to do that. That’s why I always call all of these rallies, protests. These are not rallies anymore. Because you’re allowed to have a protest, you can’t have a rally and you can’t go to church.(49:01)
You’re not allowed to go to church, but you’re allowed to burn down the cities with a protest. So we always call these friendly protests. The Biden lockdown will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, no Easter, no 4th of July, and no future. Other than that, it’s really not a bad way to go. A vote for sleepy Joe Biden is a vote for lockdowns, layoffs, misery, and no fracking. How about the guy, no fracking for over a year and a half. “There will be no fracking.” He goes to Pennsylvania, “Absolutely, we’ll frack.” Okay, and these guys don’t do anything about it. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life, then you have no choice but to cast your ballot for a gentleman named, Donald J. Trump. And as I said, you have to remember this, because during the debate, the debate was good … thank you, thank you very … thank you very much. Thank you. (50:22)
Thank you very much. (50:22)
Thank you, everybody. It’s a great honor to be with you. I really did, during the Kenosha disaster, I really got to be friendly with a lot of people up here. Long before that because we’ve had so many different people that we deal with. You have great people, we’re going to introduce you to a few of them, but you have great people here. But I really got to know you during that problem. That potential crisis that we put out very, very swiftly once we got called and it’s great. You’re great people. You built the country, you’re great people. Joe Biden, and as I said, he ran the H1NI, he called it N1H1, he couldn’t get it right. He still does, he can’t get it right. I said, “Joe, H comes before N, it’s easy to remember.”(51:05)
H1N1, swine flu. And he failed horribly and he was a laughingstock all over Washington. As you remember, as his chief of staff, I don’t know why this guy said it, but he made the worst statements. He said, “This guy, we have no idea what we’re doing.” Now, all of a sudden he’s coming and he’s … He was the one that said, I shouldn’t close it down to China, heavily infected China, right? You remember that mess? Anyway, now he runs, he said, “I should have closed it sooner.” It’s really disgraceful. Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, a respected man, he said Biden has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four years, right? Four years, he said, he’s always wrong. And he has been always wrong. I don’t believe he’s even running. I can’t believe the whole thing. I’ve watched, I watched the debates. You had 27 total killers on the stage and he was there. But you don’t have to believe me because it’s you, and because it’s Wisconsin, we spent a fortune. And hopefully that’ll work better than the microphone, try it, put it on.en, Joe Biden.g)u taken –(52:27)
This was today, he forgot to show up.aven’t taken the test. Why the hell would I take a test? Come on, man. That’s like saying, you before he got in this program, you’re taking tests where you’re taking cocaine or not, what do you think, huh? Are you a … By the way, that’s my little sister, Valerie. And I’m Jill’s husband, oh, no, they switched on me. That’s my wife, this is my sister. They switched on me. I tell him if you have a problem, figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black. There is not a single solitary reason in the world, why, why, as I said, we shouldn’t be in a position that everybody … and that’s my wife, Jill, Hey, Jill, I’m Jill’s husband, actually.n Pop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys. And I did, and back in those you [inaudible 00:53:22] how things have changed. Play the radio, make sure the television … excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night. Make sure the kids hear words. We hold these truth to be self evident. All men and women created by … you know, the thing. If you could take care, if you were a quartermaster, you can sure and help take care of running a department store thing where … and the second floor of the ladies department or whatever, you know what I mean? Well, I’m sick and tired of smart guys. You know, the rapidly rising in with … I don’t know. Ever been to a caucus? No, you haven’t. You’re a lying dog face pony soldier.ack Sanders?y, why, why, why, you’re getting nervous, man. What kind of country are we going to be? Four more years of George, George, we’re going to find ourselves in a position where, if Trump gets elected, we’re going to be a, we’re going to be in a different world. After lie, after lie, after lie. We have to come together, that’s why I’m running. I’m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate. And by the way, I sit on the stand and it get hot, I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun. And the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg down. So it was straight and then watch the hair come back up again. They’d look at it. So I learned about roaches, I learned about kids jumping on my lap. And I’d love kids jumping on my lap.and I think it’s a right for people to have [inaudible 00:55:15] care. We have to do at least several things, one, we have to depend on what the president’s going to do right now. And first of all, he has to tell, wait till the cases before anything happens. Look, exacerbating the need for environmental justice, sorry, there’s a bug. Folks, we got a lot of work to do. I don’t really need you to get me elected. The case where we cannot let this … we’ve never allowed any crisis from the civil war straight through to the pandemic of ’17, all the way around, ’16, we have never, never let our democracy sakes second fiddle way. We can both have a democracy, elections, and at the same time, correct the public health.ere I’ve been hearing all around the country. You’re trying your breast, but it never feels like enough. And here comes the train and he tried to make sure to continue to walk from. That’s the commuter, all right. But folks, look. Anyway, I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical and mental … my physical as well as my mental fitness. I’ll lead an effective strategy to mobilize true international [inaudible 00:18:36].g).(56:37)
Thank you, what a good job.(57:00)
…good job. (57:01)
Thank you. (57:09)
Thank you very much. (57:11)
That was just a small little sampling. We have many more. Some were too rough to put on, we just decided… Look. This is not what our country needs. This isn’t about… Yeah, it is about me, I guess, when you think about it. But this is not what our country can have. We can’t have this. One thing I’ll tell you I learned, President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un of North Korea and many others, all of them, they’re very sharp. They’re very smart. They’re very sharp. He wasn’t sharp 25 years ago, and now it’s not… You can’t let this happen to our country. That’s all I can say, because it’s not a game. We’re not playing a game.(57:58)
We have a good time tonight. We love each other. We’re having fun, but when you get down… It’s not about fun. We can’t let this happen to our country. Joining us tonight, speaking about somebody that’s great, is a senator who is my friend. He’s my friend and he is a… He just doesn’t stop. He’s one of the sharpest, toughest people in Washington, and he is… When he’s on somebody, that person has no chance, or that bad group has no chance. He’s the Head of Homeland, but he’s a respected person, and he’s your senator, and we love him. I’m telling you, everybody in Washington talks about him in the greatest of tones. Senator Ron Johnson. Ron, thank you.(58:47)
He doesn’t stop. You talk about not giving up. He doesn’t stop. We have Bryan Steil. Congressman, great job. Great job you’re doing. Thank you. Thank you for a great job you’re doing. Glenn Grothman. Glenn, thank you very much. Great job. Glenn’s doing a great job. Darin LaHood. Darin, good job, Darin. What a good group. You have a wonderful candidate who’s going to be running, and you know who that is? Where is he? Where is Jim? Jim? Jim Oberweis. Jim, thank you, Jim. I heard you’re doing well. Glenn, how’s he doing in the polls? Okay?’s going to win.(59:33)
He said, “He’s going to win.” When he says, “He’s going to win,” he’s going to win too. Good. Now I heard you’re doing very well. Good. Very good. State GOP Chair Andrew Hitt. How are we doing, Andrew, tomorrow? Good? We’re okay? Because he’s doing a nice job, but if we don’t win, he’ll be fired immediately. A friend of mine and a guy who’s done a terrific job, he loves his state, Kenosha’s own Reince Priebus. Where is he? Reince? Stand up, Reince. Where’s Reince? What a good guy he is, too. What a good guy. It took me years to learn how to pronounce his name properly, but he’s a fantastic person. I’m especially glad to be joined tonight by Don Jr. and Kimberly. Don? (01:00:33)
Come on up. They’re saying, “Bring them up.” Come on. Come on up. See, he’s a mountain man. He loves to go out to hunting. You don’t have a jacket. If you catch a cold… He likes the outdoors, huh? You doing okay? Come on, say something.Wisconsin. Or if I was Joe Biden, I’d say, “Florida,” but doesn’t matter. You don’t have to be right. Thank you, guys. Thank you for the support. We’ve been seeing it on the ground every day for weeks, because unlike the Bidens, we don’t have a mainstream media that will campaign for us. We have to do it ourselves on the ground with you guys. We need you to get out and bring your friends to vote tomorrow. When we do, we cannot only keep making America great again, but we can make liberals cry again. Get out there and do it, Wisconsin. Get out there and do it. Thank you guys.(01:01:40)
Good job. Thank you. Thanks, Kim. Thank you, sweetheart. Thank you very much. I’ll tell you, they’re campaigning hard. They’re all campaigning hard. They’re all campaigning. I see back there Ivanka and Jared. Jared is doing peace in the Middle East. Jared is doing a great job. Peace in the Middle East. Jared, are you going to get it done? You’re going to get it done, Jared? I hope so. Come on up. Come on up. Jared and Ivanka, come on. Come on. This is like an old home week for you. I look back, the whole family is here. Tiffany, come on up. I see Tiffany. Come on up, Tiffany. Come on up. Here, honey. Say something.Wisconsin. You have heard my father talk about some of the things that he’s been able to accomplish over the past four years. I am so proud of so many of them. But I will say, the thing that I am most proud of is unlike politicians, he’s never forgot why he ran for president, and who he is fighting for. You. Never forgot. It is a beautiful thing to see, and he works so, so hard every single day. Let me just tell you, Washington has not changed Donald Trump. Donald Trump has changed Washington. It’s true. It’s true. There’s more to come. Now we have to fight for him, and we have to fight for this country that we love so much, and get out and vote tomorrow. Thank you, Wisconsin. We love you, and God bless.(01:03:46)
Thank you, sweetheart. Jared, would you like to say something about peace in the Middle East to this very small crowd?u. It’s really an honor to be with all of you. I was just saying, ” Washington, if the things that the politicians were talking about were easy, they would have been done a long time ago.” But it took a leader like President Trump to come in and shake things up a little bit, but we’ve seen things get done that we never imagined could happen. I can tell you the table is set. There’s so many more things to do, and this whole family loves America. We love this country. We love all of you, and we will never stop fighting to get all the things done that President Trump has promised. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your love. Thank you. Thank you.(01:04:42)
Great job, Jared. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thanks, kids. Thanks, everybody. I see some people. Do I see Corey Lewandowski back there? Yes. Do I see David? Is that David? Come on. Get over here, Corey. Corey Lewandowski. David, come on. David Bossie. What a group. Stand up. Just stand up. We don’t have to hear from them. The mic doesn’t work anyway, so don’t worry about it. Great job. Great job. Good luck on television tomorrow. I think you’re going to have a blow out tomorrow, okay? But I want to thank…(01:05:19)
Look. I have a great family. I have a family. They’re working all the time, all of them. We appreciate it. Special people. We didn’t need this. We have a wonderful, super… It was just going good. Then I said, “You know, maybe I’ll give it a shot.” You know why? Because of trade. It started because of trade. I hated… I watched. It was so obvious, the way we were being ripped off on trade. I said, “Let’s give it a whirl.” I said to my wife, “I’d like to do it. What do you think?” She said, “Well, you have to really want it, because you know you will win, don’t you?” I said, “You think so? Really?” She had a little more security in the fact that if I ran… No. She said, “You will win if you… But you have to make sure you want it.” I said, “I want to do it because we have so many things we could do.”(01:06:05)
I never thought we would have done what we’ve done, though. We’ve done a lot together. Together, we’ve done so much. I mean, you think about all… It probably started more… I talked to Ron about it. It probably started with trade, though, because I hated our companies were leaving to Mexico, Canada, China. They were all leaving our country. We had these stupid laws, and horrible tax deals where they had incentives to move to Mexico. They got incentivized to move to Mexico.(01:06:31)
Somebody had a concept, “Gee, let’s make Mexico great again.” I said, “No. I want to make our country great again.” That’s the story. It’s a complicated story, but it all evolved into this evening. Tomorrow we have our big day, and tomorrow I think it’s going to be a really special day. I hope you can all go out. You’ll find the time, and go out and vote, and we’re going to make you very proud. You’re going to be made really very proud. I’m just finishing off. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, and our factories, and our troops… Finally, finally, finally we’re bringing them back home to the U.S.A. where they belong. For 47 years, Joe Biden viscously attacked Black Americans. He called young Black men, “super predators,” all the time. To every Black American. I am asking you to go out tomorrow and vote. It’s very important. This is your one and only chance to show sleep Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to jail you, and to betray you. I’m fighting for you, and we got criminal justice reform completed, prison reform completed, Opportunity Zones completed with the great Tim Scott of South Carolina. And funding for historically Black colleges and universities. We got that done.(01:08:17)
I say all the time, and sometimes people will say, “That’s a big statement.” Then they realize it’s true. With the exception of Abraham Lincoln, there’s never been a president that has done so much for the Black community, and it’s my honor. It’s my honor. It is my honor, and under my leadership… And by the way, I don’t know if you have been watching what’s going on in Florida. We’re doing really well. You know what they’re talking about? The Black community and the Hispanic American community is really… They’re liking Trump. What’s going on? No, we’re doing very well. Florida. Florida is doing very well. In conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already begun. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment. Which is totally under siege, but as long as Ron Johnson and your great congressman are there, we will protect it. Right, Glenn? Everybody. We will protect it, Ron. That’s an easy one for us. But it wouldn’t be easy if he got in. We wouldn’t have enough to say about it.(01:09:51)
We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. It starts on January 1st, and it will be bigger than healthcare. Lower drug prices ever more, favored nations. The drug companies do not like me too much, I will tell you. We’ll have the lowest drug prices anywhere in the world. We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.(01:10:24)
America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students, and we will restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.”(01:11:03)
For years, you had a president who apologized to America. Is this true? I mean, we have had… I watched Obama go out and apologize all over the world. He would apologize all over the world. He apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great, great people of Wisconsin. Tomorrow you have the power, you have the vote. You have the power really, to save America. We can’t go down that path.(01:11:37)
We will never be a socialist country. We never be. Get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, grab your boss by the tie and say, “Come on, boss. We got to get out and vote, get out and vote.” From Madison to Milwaukee, from Janesville to La Crosse, and from… Your team is doing well, right? Your team is doing well. Green Bay. Green Bay. Do you like your quarterback? I do. I like your quarterback. You know who I like? We like Brett Favre. Do you like Brett Favre? Do you know that Brett Favre endorsed me last week? We love Brett Favre. What a great guy. I got to know him. He’s a tough cookie. He’s a tough guy. Great guy. Green Bay to right here in Kenosha, we inherit the legacy of American patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears to defend our country, and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come.(01:13:11)
Proud citizens like you help build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going got keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going got keep on winning, winning, winning. Winning, you. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. Together with the incredible people of Wisconsin, we have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again. Your 401Ks are doing very well.(01:13:58)
We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We’re proud again. We’re respected. We’re respected again. We have made America safe again. We will make America great again. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you, Wisconsin. Go out and vote. Thank you. It’s a great honor."

So we’re going to Charlotte, the Charlotte area, we’ll be talking about healthcare. We have a lot of good things happening with respect to health care and very positive on pre-existing conditions. Very positive on the fact that we got rid of the individual mandate, which is the single most unpopular thing having to do with Obamacare, the Obamacare disaster. But we have a lot of incredible things, positive things, and very good things and money saving things on healthcare. Then we’re going to Florida. We have a big rally and it’ll be something. I hear there’s a tremendous number of people. So we’re not totally surprised by that, but that’s okay. Tremendous number of people. Jennifer, go ahead. (00:54)
They’re working to see if they can make a deal. And if they make a deal, they’ll have to bring it to me and I’ll either approve it or not. To me, safety is the predominant factor and we’ll see if they can do that. But they’re moving along and let’s see what happens. If they make a deal, that’s fine. And if they don’t, that’s okay too. (01:16)
So we have to be very careful with the ballots. The ballots, that’s a whole big scam. They found, I understand, eight ballots in a wastepaper basket in some location they found it. It was reported in one of the newspapers that they found a lot of ballots in a river. They throw them out if they have the name Trump on it, I guess. But they had ballots. (01:38)
Okay, well, they still found them in a river, whether they had a name on it or not. But the other ones had the Trump name on it and they were thrown into a wastepaper basket. We want to make sure the election is honest and I’m not sure that it can be. I don’t know that it can be with this whole situation. Unsolicited ballots, they’re unsolicited. Millions being sent to everybody. And we’ll see. But if you remember, Hillary Clinton just a week ago or so told Joe Biden, “Do not accept the results of the election under any circumstances.” But you don’t ask her that question. You only ask me the question. (02:21)
Say it. (02:25)
I don’t want to make a comment on that, but we’re going to make our decision on Saturday. But I won’t comment on that. I will say this, I think Saturday afternoon, five o’clock, it’s going to be a very important day in the history of our country. I think it’s going to be a very monumental, very good choice. (02:51)
I’m getting very close to a final choice. (03:06)
Well, we have numerous companies. We have Johnson & Johnson. We have Pfizer. We have Moderna. We have others too. They’re great companies, the best in the world. So I think you’d put the people of New York at great risk. And he’s done that, if you look at the nursing homes. 11,000 people died needlessly. So when you look at that, it’s very sad. So we’ll see. He’ll have to see. But these are great companies. These are being done by, really, probably, some of the greatest companies in the world, when you think, with Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, et cetera. I think that they are getting very close. As you know, they’re in final testing right now. Phase three, but final. They’ve given shots to everybody, to a lot, thousands and thousands of people. And so far it looks very good and it looks like it could happen fairly quickly. (04:02)
I think it’s a sad thing. And I give my regards to the family of Breonna. I also think it’s so sad what’s happening with everything about that case, including law enforcement. So many people suffering, so many people needlessly suffering. But with respect to Breonna, we give our regards to the family. (04:28)
Well, it was an honor to be a nominated for two Nobel Prizes. So that was an honor, and we’ll see what’s happening. I know that China now and India are having difficulty and very, very substantial difficulty. And hopefully, there’ll be able to work that out. If we can help, we’d love to have. (05:12)
Well, I think that was just a political chant. We could hardly hear it from where we were. Somebody said there was some chanting, but they were right next to the media. But we really could hardly hear too much. We heard a sound but it wasn’t very strong. (05:34)
I think that peaceful protest is, number one, it’s fine to do that in a peaceful manner. (05:42)
When it gets less than peaceful, as you see all over, then it’s unacceptable and that’s where law and order is necessary and that’s where law enforcement is very important. (06:03)
Well, we’re speaking with a lot of people about that. I’m doing very well in Maine. You’ve seen the numbers. What I’ve done for Maine is what nobody’s done. I’ve freed up 5,000 square miles of ocean that was taken away by President Obama. And for the lobster, the people that go out and get us those great lobsters that we all like so much, I freed that whole business up and the fishermen too. We freed it up. So I think I’ve done more for Maine than just about anybody, certainly, in many, many years. So I’m doing very well in Maine. I don’t know. I haven’t seen polls on Susan. But I hope she does well. Thank you."

I’m going to Ohio. Things seem to be very good. We have been doing very well with the China virus, but they’ve had pretty big spike in Europe as you know, in UK in particular. And I’m sure they’ll have that under control, hopefully soon, but we’re in very good shape. The vaccines are coming along. I just got a report. The vaccines are coming along rapidly. Therapeutics are coming along very well and we’ll see what happens, but too bad about Europe, too bad. (00:39)
I would say on Friday or Saturday, I’ll be announcing the pick. Five women are being looked at and vetted very carefully. Five, and we’ll make a decision probably Saturday, but Friday, or Saturday. (01:04)
Yeah, I will. (01:06)
During this period of time. (01:09)
I don’t know. I doubt it. (01:11)
I doubt it,, but we’ll meet with a few, probably. (01:16)
Say it. (01:18)
I have. (01:18)
I have. Today and yesterday, day before. (01:29)
Well, I’d much rather have a vote before the election, because there’s a lot of work to be done and I’d much rather have it. We have plenty of time to do it. There’s really a lot of time. So, let’s say I make the announcement on Saturday. There’s a great deal of time before the election. That’ll be up to Mitch and the Senate, but I’d certainly much rather have the vote. I think it sends a good signal and it’s solidarity and lots of other things. And I’m just doing my constitutional obligation. I have an obligation to do this, so I would rather see it before the election. (02:12)
We’ll have to see. I would think that that would be very bad for them. I think their voters, the people that voted them, put them there because of a certain ideology, or a certain feel. And they don’t want to have somebody do that. I think it’s very bad if they do that. (02:37)
Yeah, it just sounds to me like it would be somebody else. I don’t believe… It could be. It could be, and it might not be too. It was just too convenient. (02:50)
No concern, I just think it would be better. They asked would I rather have it. I’d rather have it before the election. I think it would be better for our country and we’ll pick somebody that’s outstanding, very qualified. They’re all qualified, but somebody that is outstanding and I’d rather see it all take place before the election. So before November 3rd. (03:15)
No, I don’t think so. No, I think we’re going to win. If you look at the polls, the real polls, we’re doing very well. We’re going to Ohio tonight. We’re packed. We’re packed everywhere. There’s never been, we’ve never had spirit like we have now. Even four years ago, the spirit now is greater even than it was four years ago. [crosstalk 00:03:35] (03:38)
I did. I just did it, just there. My message is a strong message on China. And basically you’ll see it, you’ll see it tomorrow, but I just did it a little while ago. (04:00)
I have one, or two that I have in mind. [crosstalk 00:04:05]. (04:06)
Say it. (04:11)
We’ll talk about that at another time. (04:17)
One of the people that’s very respected, but they’re all respected. She’s certainly one of the candidates. Yes. (04:27)
I may, she’s highly thought of. And I’m getting a lot of phone calls from a lot of people. She has a lot of support. I don’t know it, but I hear she’s outstanding. (04:43)
And she’s one of the people we’re looking at. (04:49)
Well, I think they are, but that’s up to DOJ. That will be up to the attorney general. But certainly they are. If you look at Portland, you look at what’s going on there. What a mess. Go ahead. And we could straighten it out. All Democrats, all radical lefts, we could straighten it out so fast. Go ahead. (05:13)
That’s working its way through. I give it a preliminary okay. They will work at two great companies, Oracle and Walmart. Now Larry Ellison’s a great genius at that kind of thing. The technology is incredible. And so if we can save it, we’ll save it. And if we can’t, we’ll cut it off. But they have preliminary. We’ll see what they could do. We have to have total security. That’s the only thing. Very important. We have to have total security. I’ll see you in Ohio. Thank you."
trump_sean_hannity.txt,"(00:20)
Really good, and First Lady is doing really good. I thought Mark was fantastic, and I love your show. (00:51)
Yeah, I just saw the doctors today. They think I’m in great shape. I’m in great shape. I know I’m in good shape [crosstalk 00:00:54]. (00:55)
And I’ll tell you, I took this Regeneron. It’s phenomenal. Eli Lilly has something very comparable. It’s phenomenal. It’s a whole new day. It’s all… If you go back a few months, nobody ever even thought about this stuff. We came up with it, and I’m going to have it delivered to every hospital we have sick people with the COVID, or the China Virus as we call it, and we’re going to make people better. It actually made me better. I went in, I could have left a day later.(01:24)
I’m telling you Sean, it was incredible. So, that’s Regeneron. But again, Eli Lilly has something similar. The kind of things we’re coming up with now are incredible. Remdesivir, but that’s a little bit different, works much differently actually. But these things are absolutely incredible. I think I’m going to try doing a rally on Saturday night if we have enough time to put it together. But we want to do a rally probably in Florida on Saturday night. I might come back and do one in Pennsylvania the following night. It’s incredible what’s going on, because I feel so good. (02:05)
Well, what we’re doing is probably the test will be tomorrow, the actual test, because there’s no reason to test all the time. But they found very little the infection or virus, if any. I don’t know that they found any. I didn’t go into it greatly with the doctors. We have these great doctors at Walter Reed, and you do rely on them. They’re really fantastic talents, and they came in from Johns Hopkins also and other places. Yeah. When you’re president, there are so many doctors looking over me. I think I’m the most analyzed human being in the world right now. But we have… They had people at not only Walter Reed which is incredible with the job they do, but also Johns Hopkins and other hospitals. I think they’re amazed at how quickly this went frankly. (03:20)
Well, I didn’t even want to use them. Last time, I had a big problem. They isolated my mikes when I had one debate… We had three debates with Hillary. Or I think the first debate, they… Excuse me. On the first debate, they asked isolated the mike and they isolated it very, very seriously, and they actually apologized to me. And I said- (03:44)
… “What’s this all about?” They were Clinton people. And I said, “We ought to just do the debates ourselves, John. We ought to just do it ourselves.” I pick… I’m the president, so we won’t to have debates. I’d rather just do it ourselves. Pick some good anchor. So I ended up with Chris Wallace who’s essentially… Look, his father did me once or twice. Twice, I guess. Those 60 minutes, he was great, Mike. Chris is not Mike that I can tell you. He’s not even close, but Chris was terrible. He was protecting Biden the whole night. I asked Biden about, “Why did he get all of that money from the Mayor of Russia, from the wife of the Mayor of Russia?” Then Chris wouldn’t let that be answered.(04:23)
When I said, “What did you do with a billion dollars? You’re not getting a billion dollars to Ukraine unless you get rid of the prosecutor.” Chris wouldn’t let that. He protected him. The guy was choking like a dog. He couldn’t answer the questions and he was choking like a dog. And Chris kept staying, and so now we have another one. I didn’t know this, but the other one is from C-SPAN and he’s never-Trumper, and I think somebody said he worked for Biden at one point. These are the people we get.(04:50)
That’s okay, because I’ve had some bad ones over the years, and I’ve got an unblemished record I think in the debating world according to the polls. If you look at [inaudible 00:04:59] 15 debates last time, and they say I won them all against very talented people in some cases. But I will say this, that it’s a very sad thing. Now you have this Debate Commission. It’s a joke. The commission’s a joke. Take a look at the letter they wrote me four years ago when they apologized. They were oscillating my mike. They were turning it up and down when I was speaking to Hillary, crooked Hillary who turns out to be very crooked.(05:25)
Look at all the stuff we found out on Obama and Biden and her. So we’ll see what happens. But no, I’m not interested in doing a virtual. I’m not Joe Biden. I’m not going to do a virtual debate, sit behind a computer screen. That gives them the answers, because there’ll be handing him the answers just like he gets what he asks. He does news conferences, he does them and they give him the answer and they give him the question and they give him what kind of a news conference. He does them all the time. He was choking like a dog the other night, but Chris Wallace bailed him in. He just bailed him in or bailed him out. (06:25)
Well, I might. I’ll do it right through your show. Let’s go, Joe. Let’s have a fair… Let’s get a fair anchor, somebody like a great Sean Hannity. We’ll get Rush. (06:35)
We’ll get Mark. We’ll get Laura. (06:37)
We’ll get [Judge Jeanine 00:06:38]. (06:41)
We got a lot of them out there. We got a lot. We’ll get Jesse or Pete. We got a lot of them. Tucker [inaudible 00:06:48] feeling good. [crosstalk 00:06:49] is a disgrace. (06:54)
[inaudible 00:06:54] but this is a disgrace what’s going on. So now I find out the guy that’s doing it from C-SPAN is a never-Trumper, but I don’t mind that. Look at the people I’ve had in the past, and I’ve always won the debates. I had Martha Raddatz. Her hatred was so incredible I couldn’t believe it, but I beat Hillary in that debate easily. So I don’t mind that. It’s not even that. But I’m not going to sit behind a computer and have somebody feed him answers, because he has no idea, because he won’t be president for three months before the wonderful Kamala takes over with her. She’s the most liberal person in the senate. She’s not a socialist. She’s a step beyond socialism as you know. (07:34)
I thought Mike was great, legitimately. I don’t mean because he’s with me and he’s my friend and he’s done a great job as vice president, I thought he was great. He’s a calm person. We’re really a good combination. A lot of people have said that for a long time. He’s a calm person. He’s a good person, and he was just… He couldn’t believe some of the things she was saying, and he really didn’t. He couldn’t believe it what she was saying. They lie. They lie so much, like fracking.(08:03)
Him and her for a year, whatever the Democrat debate said, we are against fracking. We will… Biden says, “We will never ever see fracking and…” etc. As soon as he gets the nomination, he has to center over a little bit. No, we want to go fracking. We’ll be fracking. Her too, even her. I mean, she’s a super… Then they get beat up by AOC plus 3, because they said, you never said that before. Now the press gives them a pass. The reason they give them a pass is because they are fake. The news is fake, the enemy of the people and the press gives them a pass. If I ever did that, I would be excoriated. (09:00)
Yeah, terrible thing. (09:26)
I think it was a terrible thing to say. I think it’s so disrespectful to the people, and he should have said something, and say, “Look, to the best of my knowledge, this is probably what I’d do.” I think what he said was so disrespectful to the process and to the people. What he said then was just disgraceful. But what that means really is that they’re going to do it, because obviously, that means 100% that’s what they’re going to do. No, they’re going to end the filibuster and they’re going to do things that you wouldn’t have thought. I’d been fighting the filibuster with Mitch for a long time, because I said, “Mitch, they’re going to do whatever. If they ever got in, Schumer would do that on day one.” I agree that what they did was right.(10:09)
You take a look at what Mitch and some very good Republican senators, because it’s good for the country. But I said, “Here’s the problem. If they ever got in, day one, this would be the first move they make, end the filibuster,” the nuclear option as they call it. And they’ll do that… Not a week will go by, probably not a day will go by. But again, Harry Reid did it, that’s why we have so many judges. I want to thank you very much, Harry Reid. Because Harry Reid, he ended the filibuster and I’m going to have 300 judges by the time I finish. 300, it’s a record by the end of the first term. Think of that. It’s a record [inaudible 00:10:49] the term. By the end of the first term, I have 300 judges just about give or take a few couple. And- (10:57)
… it’s all because of… Think of it, Sean. It’s all because of Harry Reid and a lot of good work- (11:00)
… by a lot of good Republicans including Mitch. (11:54)
Well, he’s got a lot of non-answers. Look at Second Amendment, you never talk about Second Amendment. He wants to take away your guns 100%. He put Beto as a… He turned out to be… He was exposed by Ted Cruz and me, I think I helped a lot too. But he was exposed as a clown, as much worse than that, but I want to be nice, because it’s a nice evening show. But he was exposed as a clown. He wants to take away your guns. He’s going to take away your Second Amendment. Nobody ever… Nobody asks him about the Second Amendment anymore. Do you notice that? The Second Amendment is very important. It’s a big thing that we campaign on it. I protected this.(12:36)
If I weren’t president, you wouldn’t have a Second Amendment right now. And Biden does it. Nobody’s talks about life anymore, pro-life. Is he pro-life? No, he’s not pro-life. What is he? Why don’t you ask him that question? He doesn’t want to talk about it. But he endorsed a Governor of Virginia who not only executed a baby late term abortion, but executed a baby because he said the baby can be born and then you can kill the baby. He’s totally in favor of that. I can tell you, your pro-life groups are… They’re in mess. This is their one shot because what’s going on is so bad.(13:24)
It’s so evil. The governor of Virginia said, we will execute the baby after the baby is born, that’s… When you talk about late term abortion, this is early term execution, and it’s a very, very bad thing. But you don’t ever hear everybody talking about pro-life, pro-choice with Biden. Did you ever hear it? I haven’t heard it. Very rarely do you hear it? I don’t think he’d know how to discuss it. But very importantly, a Second Amendment. They just don’t discuss the Second Amendment. He’s going to take your guns away. So everybody with a gun, you can’t vote for him because you’re not going to have your gun. At the same time, they want to defund the police.(14:01)
So if you’re not going to have police protection and by the way, you can’t have a gun. So if one of these maniacs breaks into your house at night because there are no cops around and you don’t have a gun to protect yourself, that’s a great combination. The suburbs are going to fall. A lot of people talk about the women of the suburbs. Women of the suburbs, they do or don’t like Trump. I don’t know. But what I’ve done is incredible for the suburbs. The suburbs are over as you know. The suburbs have become more unsafe than the cities run by the Democrats. And so I think I should do very well with suburban women, because I’m the one that’s protecting them both in terms of law and order and in terms of zoning.(14:44)
They want to build low-income housing right next to your house as the American dream is destroyed, but they don’t talk to Biden about this. They don’t talk to him about law and order. I said to him the other night, “Mention the words law and order.” He wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. I said, “Don’t mention the word law and order. Go ahead.” He wouldn’t do it. And then of course Chris Wallace came in to protect him. (16:09)
And I condemn the people on the left like Antifa that are burning down your cities all summer long and without any control whatsoever. They’re all Biden people, meaning not Biden. Biden’s not smart enough to know what the hell it even is, but they’re of that philosophy. I condemn them very strongly, very, very strongly. It’s not just the right. It’s the right, it’s the left. But the left has been the problem up for a long time. Antifa is a big, big problem. I see Whitmer today, she’s complaining, but it was our justice department that arrested the people that she was complaining about.(16:44)
It was my justice department that arrested them. But instead, she goes and does her little political act and she keeps her state closed although we just won the big case as you know to open up Michigan, because what she’s doing is a horrible thing to the people. The churches are closed, the schools are closed and all state is closed. People are being hurt very badly by it in the form of drinking and suicides and depression. It’s a very sad thing. But now, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes. And very sadly, if you take a look, he wants to raise taxes, but he says he’s going to end our tax cut. Well, people are getting actually much more.(17:22)
Mike [Inaudible 00:00:17:23], he said 2000 was actually much more than $2,000 in child tax credits, which is a $1000 a child. but he wants to take all that away. So therefore, if you do nothing else, you’re raising taxes by the largest percentage in the history of our country. If he terminated my tax cuts, which is one of the reasons that our economy has done so great, even now in this pandemic which hopefully we’re rounding the turn and we have incredible cures and a lot of therapeutics and the vaccines are going to be coming very soon. But I’ll tell you what I took is incredible. To me, I viewed it as a cure. It’s incredible, and we’re going to get it to everybody free of charge.(18:01)
It’s going to hospitals. Starting very soon, the military is going to be delivering it. But he’s looking to do big, big tax cuts, big, big tax increases at a level that’s never been seen. Nobody’s ever gotten the cuts that I got. I got the biggest tax cuts ever given as you know Sean, better than probably most. But he’s going to end those tax cuts and reverse them. And now, people are going to pay $2000 plus child tax credits, all that. It’s going to be a disaster for our country. It’s going to put our country into a depression. Your 401ks are going to go down the tubes, and your jobs are going to go away, and you’re going to have a depression the likes of which our country has never seen before. And that possibly includes 1929. (19:30)
Well, it’s a deal that was conceived up by not smart people, AOC plus 3 and others, but I don’t even think they had any experience in the environment. But this was a deal conceived up. The real price is $100 trillion. That’s more money that this country could make in 100 years if things went well. They literally want to take buildings down and rebuild them with tiny little windows. Little windows, so you can’t see out, you can see the light. The whole thing is so crazy. It’s such a crazy thing. Take a look, Biden agreed to this with crazy Bernie, because they have the manifesto.(20:11)
They’ve agreed to most of these things, and it’s going to cost more money. Our country will be a Ninth World country, not a Third World country, a Ninth World country. We won’t have energies. Look at what’s happening with the rolling blackouts in California? Looking at where California is going to have to ration water? You know why? Because they set millions of gallons of water out to sea, out to the Pacific because they want to take care of certain little tiny fish that aren’t doing very well without water to be honest with you. But it’s a very sad thing that’s happening. It’s still common sense. Even the fires in California. I talk about, you need…(20:53)
I was with governor Newsom. I get along with him very well. We disagree on a lot of things, but I get along with him. Number one, you should let water come down from the North and accept it instead of throwing it out to the Pacific. But you also have to have forest management. We send them so much money. I don’t have to, but I want to help California. But they have the biggest forest fires because they don’t manage their land. They don’t have separators. They have trees that have been laying on the ground that are stone cold dead, dry like a matchstick. You throw a cigarette butts on between the leaves and the trees, everything catches on fire. You lose 200,000 acres in a short period of time. They get to manage their forest. And if they manage their forest, you’re not going to see the forest fires. (22:10)
Well, I want them to vote, but I will say this, absentee is okay, because absentee ballots… Excuse me. Absentee ballots are fine, because absentee ballots, you request, you ask for a ballot and you request and that’s it. Absentee ballots are absolutely fine. You request them, you fill them in, you send them back in. But these unsolicited ballots, universal unsolicited ballots Sean, it’s going to be a disaster the likes of which we’ve never seen. We will never have seen an election like what’s going to take place. Thousands of ballots all over the country are being reported. Some thrown in garbage cans with my name on them. Some thrown in trays in a river. What’s going on is absolutely crazy. We have people watching. We have US attorneys watching. We have sheriffs watching. We have US Marshals watching. But with all of that- (23:05)
… you’re talking about millions of ballots are being sent out- (23:13)
… [crosstalk 00:23:13] big and tremendous fraud. (23:28)
Well, my supporters are going to be mostly people that vote. They go to the vote the old fashioned where it’s like go to the voting booth and vote, which first of all, we should have voter ID all over the country. We don’t. When you buy something, you have voter ID. To get into the Democrat National Convention, you had to have voter ID. (23:51)
Right. But to get into vote, you don’t need voter ID in many places. In many places, you do. Indiana has a great system. You have many places where you do have it. But we should have voter ID, universal voter ID. When you go to vote, they should see who you are, make sure that it’s not fraudulent. But this will be one of the greatest fraudulent, most fraudulent elections ever because of this whole thing with… They’re sending out millions and millions and millions of ballots. Where are they sending them? Who’s sending them? Where are they going? Where are they coming back from? How many are fraudulent? Are they being thrown away? Are they being sold?(24:27)
Are they being harvested? It’s a terrible thing, Sean. Despite that, I think we’re going to have a tremendous victory. I saw some polls just now, some real polls not the fake news polls where they put out fake numbers like at CNN and ABC, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, NBC. It’s the same stuff as I had. It’s not nearly as bad as it used to be. It used to be much worse believe it or not. It’s hard to believe when you think of it. But I’m looking at polls that are doing great. We’re doing great in Ohio. We’re doing great in Iowa. We’re doing great in many, many places, many places. Then you come home, you turn on television. You say, gee, I’m four down. I can’t believe it. But they’re the fake polls. (25:41)
We caught them spying on our campaign. This is treason. We caught them trying to take down a duly elected administration/ president. We have all the evidence down. Now, we have to see what the law enforcement’s going to do with it, but we caught them spying. As sure as you’re sitting there, I assume you’re sitting, but as- (26:04)
… sure as you’re sitting there, we caught them spying on our campaign. You know that almost better than anybody. And it’s something when you see the New York times, Washington Post get [inaudible 00:26:14] surprises they got everything wrong. They get everything wrong. We caught them spying in our campaign. We caught them trying to take down a duly elected… And then they talk about, we want a peaceful transition of power. Peaceful- (26:30)
… [crosstalk 00:26:30] answer was that answer last night. Peaceful transition. Look what they did. They spent three and a half years trying to terminate a presidency. (26:55)
It’s doing really well. (26:56)
Thank you very much. (26:58)
Thank you, Sean."

You’re going to save that pen. Thank you, Aaron. I want you to know that your dad is one of the bravest men anywhere in the world. You know that, right? You knew that before. I think you knew that before we knew it. So congratulations to both.(04:12)
With us also is our first lady. Thank you, darling. And Vice President Mike Pence. Mike, thank you very much. Along with Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper. Mark, thank you. Congressman Richard Hudson.

I also want to recognize the three medal of honor recipients that are with us. Matthew Williams, Edward Byers, and Walter Marm. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.(05:25)
That’s great. A lot of brave people are with us today. Pat grew up in a small town in South Carolina. His dad is a police officer. His grandfather served in World War II and Korea, Vietnam. Service to our country really goes through their veins very, very rapidly. Exactly 19 years ago today, on September 11, 2001, news of the attack on our nation’s great, great country. This was just an attack like a has never happened to us. But it went through Pat’s high school and went through his classroom. And Pat was sitting there listening. His teacher solemnly told the students that their generation had a fight to win. They were going to fight and fight to win. In that moment, Pat was called to action. He knew that his country needed him. 10 short months later, at the age of 18, Pat was in Army basic training at Fort Benning.(06:29)
Soon he joined the elite ranks of the legendary Army Rangers. Pat became an exceptional soldier and expert sniper. He saw heavy combat in multiple theaters of battle. In 2010, during a deployment in Afghanistan, his leg was severely wounded by an enemy grenade. While recovering in South Carolina, Pat met with his wife, Alison. Well, that was probably not a bad wound then, was it? It was worth, I hope you’re going to say it was worth it. It was less than two years after being injured, Pat competed against some of America’s toughest warriors and won the prestigious Best Ranger Competition, among the most grueling physical contests anywhere in the country.(07:15)
In October of 2015, on his 14th deployment, Pat was part of a team assigned to plan and conduct an operation to rescue over 70 Kurdish prisoners being held by ISIS barbarians in Iraq. The team soon received horrifying intelligence that the terrorists were planning to massacre their captives and bury them in freshly dug graves. Pat and his teammates raced into action. After midnight on October 22nd, Pat boarded a helicopter and departed on a mission to free the hostages from two buildings guarded by dozens of ruthless and bloodthirsty ISIS terrorists. He was in command of a team clearing one of the compounds. As soon as the ramp to his helicopter went down, Pat rushed into a blistering hail of gunfire. Pat and his team swiftly overpowered the enemy, secured the building, and freed 38 of the hostages.(08:19)
Then Pat received word that the rest of the assault team was facing harsh resistance in another complex. Pat turned to one of his fellow soldiers and said, “Let’s get into the fight right now. Let’s get into the fight.” He saw that the other building was on fire and he knew more of the hostages were still trapped inside. He and his team climbed up ladders to the roof and opened up fire on the enemy. Multiple ISIS fighters detonated suicide vests, ripping a portion of the building into pieces. But Pat and his fellow Rangers fought through the fire, the bullets and the deadly blasts. Pat navigated to the front door and saw the captives were being held behind a metal door secured by two very heavy padlocks. He grabbed a pair of bolt cutters and ran through smoldering flame and smoke. As bullets impacted all around him, Pat succeeded in cutting one of the locks before scorching, sweltering heat forced him to leave the building for some air. Pat caught his breath in a few seconds and was back.(09:28)
He ran right back into that raging blaze, he sliced the final lock and released the rest of the hostages as the building began to collapse. He received orders to evacuate, but he refused to do so. He didn’t want to leave anyone behind. Pat ran back into the burning building that was collapsing two more times. He saved multiple hostages and he was the last man to leave. He wouldn’t leave no matter what they said, no matter who ordered him to do it, he wouldn’t do it. He was the last one out. It was one of the largest and most daring rescue missions in American history. Pat and his team rescued 75 captives and killed 20 ISIS terrorists. Pat, you embody the righteous lorry of American valor. We stand in awe of your heroic, daring, and gallant deeds. You truly went above and beyond the call of duty to earn our nation’s highest military honor.(10:28)
Pat would be the first to remind us that he was not alone that day. In the battle, one army ranger made the ultimate sacrifice, Master Sergeant Josh Wheeler. Josh was something, right Pat? Josh was something. You’ve said that before. Today, we’re deeply moved to be joined by Master Sergeant Wheeler’s wife, Ashley Wheeler. Ashley, our hearts break for your loss. A great man. That was a great man. Ashley, where is Ashley? Ashley, please stand up. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ashley. Our nation endures because fearless warriors like Josh are willing to lay down their lives for our freedom. Our children can grow up in peace because Josh had the courage to face down evil. Our debt to him and to you is everlasting. And again, thank you very much, Ashley. We appreciate it very much. We will honor him forever. You know that. Very special group of warriors, men, great men.(11:47)
Pat has said that as soon as our soldiers boots hit the ground, they are ambassadors of the American way of life. Everywhere they go, the men and women of our armed forces instill our friends with hope, our enemies with dread, and our fellow citizens with unyielding American pride. Over the course of his service, Pat has embarked on an astounding, really an astounding 17 deployments in defense of our nation. General Milley, that’s a lot, right? Is that a lot? That’s a lot. Okay. I needed that little extra confirmation. That’s a lot. He now serves as an instructor at the US Army Special Operations Command training the next generation of American warriors. Today, he joins the immortal company of our most revered American heroes. Pat, you personify the motto, “Rangers lead the way.” And you inspire us all. It is now my privilege to present Sergeant Major Thomas Patrick Payne with the Congressional Medal of Honor. I’d like to ask the military aid to come forward and read the citation. Thank you very much."
trump_town_hall.txt,"(04:48)
I’m feeling great, I don’t know about you. How is everyone feeling? (05:00)
It’s great to be back in my home state, Florida, to make my official return to the campaign trail. (05:10)
My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family. (06:37)
That was very well stated, I have to say. Good job. (06:46)
Thank you, thank you. (06:48)
Nothing whatsoever, I’m great, I feel good. I was in North Carolina today and did a big rally with tremendous turnout, and I just feel really good. Florida, Pennsylvania, were- They said, “Let’s go to the hospital.” I said, “That’s okay. I’m going to respond to what you say.” And we went over to Walter Reed, where you have tremendous professionals. They gave me Regeneron and Remdeceiver both. And all I know is I felt good the following day, I felt really good. (07:39)
No, but they said the lungs are a little bit different, a little bit perhaps infected, and- (07:48)
I don’t know. I mean, I didn’t do too much asking. I really felt good. I didn’t have much of a problem with the lungs. I did have a little bit of a temperature. Obviously, I felt there was something missing, and then I tested, I tested positive. (08:06)
Yeah, and there shouldn’t be. (08:18)
Well, I test quite a bit, and I can tell you that before the debate, which I thought it was a very good debate, and I felt fantastically, I had no problems before. (08:29)
I don’t know, I don’t even remember. I test all the time. But I can tell you this, after the debate, I guess a day or so, I think it was Thursday evening, maybe even late Thursday evening, I tested positive. That’s when I first found out about it. (08:48)
Yeah. (08:53)
I had no problem. Again, the doctors do it. I don’t ask them. I test all the time. And they- (09:00)
If you ask as the doctor, they’ll give you a perfect answer. But they take a test and I leave and I go about my business. (09:07)
I probably did, and I took a test the day before and the day before, and I was always in great shape, and I was in great shape for the debate. And it was only after the debate, a period of time after the debate that I said, “That’s interesting.” And they took a test and it tested positive. (09:26)
No. No, but I take a lot of tests. (09:31)
Possibly I did, possibly I didn’t. But the doctor has very accurate information and it’s not only that doctor, it’s many doctors. The one thing, if you’re President, you have a lot of doctors you’re surrounded by. But I was in great shape for the debate. And sometime after the debate, I tested positive, then that’s when they decided to, let’s go. (10:19)
Well, they do a lot of testing in the White House, they test everybody including me, but they test everybody. And something happened. But as far as the mask is concerned, I’m good with masks. I’m okay with masks. I tell people, wear a mask. But just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it. So this is a very- (10:40)
That’s what I heard, and that’s what I saw. And regardless, but everybody’s tested and they’re tested often. And I also knew that, hey, I’m President. I have to see people. I can’t be in a basement. I can’t be in a room. I can’t be… I have to be out. (10:58)
I can, but people with masks are catching it all the time. I mean, if you look at the Governor of Virginia, he was known for a mask. If you look at Thom Tillis, a great guy, he always had a mask, and they caught it. (11:16)
Yeah. (11:22)
Yes, I know this. (11:26)
Well, I mean, he has to say that. I think it’s great, he’s a friend of mine. He’s a good guy. And wrong or not wrong, you have to understand, as President, I can’t be locked in a room someplace for the next year and just stay and do nothing. And every time I go into a crowd, I was with the parents of our fallen heroes. These people are the most incredible people. And they came up to me and they would hug me, and they would touch me, and I’m not to not let them do it, to be honest with you. (11:59)
There was, exactly right. We had a gold star event with the most incredible people you’ve ever seen. And I could have chosen not to talk to them, or to keep everybody away. And you know what? I don’t think that’s probably where it was caught, but maybe it was. (12:18)
No, I don’t know where it came from, and you don’t know where it came from, and the doctors don’t know where it came from. But as the President, I have to be out there. I also know- (12:30)
I know this. (12:33)
I mean, let’s see, Kamala. She’s got people now, people have it, and I’m not blaming her. I’m not saying, “Oh, she did a terrible thing.” As President, I have to be out there. I can’t be in a basement. I can’t be locked in a very beautiful room someplace in the White House. And I want to see the gold star families, and I want to see everybody. And I also say to people all the time, it’s risky doing it. It is risky doing it. (13:09)
But many people are catching it. Many people are getting this disease that was sent to us by China, and it shouldn’t have been allowed to happen. But many people are getting this. And I mean, nobody’s being blamed. Everybody is working hard to get this thing out of our country, get it out of the world. Look at what’s going on in Europe, massive spikes. They’ve done a very good job, but now you take a look today at the UK, you take a look at Spain and France and Italy. There’s tremendous spikes. (13:38)
Well, I have thing right here that will tell you exactly the opposite. (13:41)
The UK is up 2500%, because I knew you’d be doing this. I know you very well. The UK is up 2500%. The EU is up 722%. And the United States is down 21%. (14:01)
Excess mortality. (14:01)
Excess mortality, we’re a winner on the excess mortality. And what we’ve done has been amazing. And we have done an amazing job. And it’s rounding the corner and we have the vaccines coming, and we have the therapies coming. And I’ll tell you what, one thing. When I got it, I had a choice. Do nothing, or use some of the things that we’re looking at, like in this case, Regeneron. and Eli Lilly makes something that’s supposed to be incredible. And I think that maybe I wouldn’t be doing this discussion with you right now. We have therapies now and cures, maybe you can use the word cure, but we have therapies that are absolutely incredible, Savannah. (14:42)
I believe we’re rounding the corner, yes. (14:51)
Right, right. That’s right. (15:08)
Yeah. (15:18)
The cure can not be worse than the problem itself. We did the right thing. We were expected to lose 2,200,000 people, and maybe more than that. We’re at 210,000 people. One person is too much, it should have never happened because of China. It happened because of China. And you have to get that and understand that. But it shouldn’t have happened. But we were expected to lose, if you look at the original charts from original doctors who are respected by everybody, 2,200,00 people. (15:53)
We saved 2 million people. (16:01)
I don’t know, let me tell you what is happening. I left North Carolina, which I love. I left Pennsylvania. We won a big case in Michigan because that governor has a lockdown where nobody but her husband can do anything. He can go boating and do whatever he wants, but nobody else can. The fact is we’re winning all these cases because it’s unconstitutional what they’re doing. And I think they’re doing it for political reasons. But the fact is the cure, you can’t let this continue to go on with the lockdowns. And I believe that on November 4th, you’re going to have a lot of these governors.(16:35)
Look at what’s happening to New York. New York is a mess. They lost almost 40,000 people. They have a lockdown like you’ve never seen. Now they’re open, it’s like a ghost town. And Savannah, it’s very important. People are leaving New York by the thousands, and you’re going to have a hard time ever building it up again. So that cure, that so called cure that you talk about, it can’t be worse than the problem. The problem is a bad problem. (17:03)
… than the problem. The problem is a bad problem. (17:03)
Okay, fine. (17:24)
Oh, you always do this. (17:26)
No, you always do this. (17:27)
You’ve done this to me, and everybody- (17:29)
I denounce white supremacy. Okay? (17:31)
I’ve denounced white supremacy, for years, but you always do it. You always start off with the question. You didn’t ask Joe Biden, whether or not he denounces Antifa. I watched him on the same basic show with Lester Holt, and he was asking questions like Biden was a child. (17:48)
So, are you ready? Are you… Wait. Are you listening? I denounce white supremacy. (17:53)
What’s your next question? (17:58)
Hesitant? Here we go again. Every time… In fact, my people came, “I’m sure they’ll ask you the white supremacy question.” I denounce white supremacy. (18:06)
And frankly, you want to know something? I denounce Antifa, and I denounce these people on the left that are burning down our cities, that are run by Democrats who don’t know what they’re doing- (18:34)
So, I know [crosstalk 00:18:35]- (18:34)
Yeah. (18:37)
I know nothing about QAnon. (18:41)
I know very little. You told me, but what you tell me, doesn’t necessarily make it fact. I hate to say that. I know nothing about it. I do know they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard. But I know nothing about it. If you’d like me to- (18:57)
… study the subject. I’ll tell you what I do know about. I know about Antifa, and I know about the radical left, and I know how violent they are and how vicious they are. And I know how they are burning down cities run by Democrats, not run by Republicans. (19:20)
He may be right. (19:20)
Can I be honest? He may be right. I just don’t know about QAnon. (19:23)
I don’t know. No, I don’t know. I don’t know. You tell me all about it. (19:28)
Let’s waste the whole show. You start off with white supremacy. I denounce it. You start off with something else. Let’s go. Keep asking me these questions. But let me just- (19:39)
… let me just tell you. What I do hear about it, is they are very strongly against pedophilia. And I agree with that. I mean, I do agree with that- (19:45)
… and I agree with it very strongly. (19:49)
I have no idea. I know nothing about them. (19:52)
No, I don’t know that. (19:55)
And neither do you, know that. (19:58)
Why aren’t you asking me about Antifa? Why aren’t you asking me about the radical left? (20:02)
Why aren’t you asking Joe Biden questions about, why doesn’t he condemn Antifa? Why does he say it doesn’t exist? (20:09)
Antifa, no, excuse me. That’s so cute. Antifa exists. They’re vicious, they’re violent. They kill people, and they’re burning down our cities. And they happen to be radical left. (20:35)
I know nothing about it, can I [crosstalk 00:20:36]- (20:38)
That was a retweet. That was an opinion of somebody- (20:41)
…. and that was a retweet. I’ll put it out there. People can decide for themselves. I don’t take a position. (20:47)
No, no. No, no. (20:47)
That was a retweet. And I do a lot of retweets. And frankly, because the media is so fake, and so corrupt, if I didn’t have social media… I don’t call it Twitter, I call it social media. I wouldn’t be able to get the word out. And the word is- (21:04)
… and you know what the word is? The word is very simple. We’re building our country, stronger and better than it’s ever been before. (21:11)
And that’s what’s happening. And everybody knows it. (21:14)
You know what else the word is? We’re winning in a lot of states. (21:16)
We’re winning in a lot of States. You’re going to see that. (21:38)
Sure, they can. And do you know what? (21:40)
Win or lose, that’s the way I want it to be. But when I see thousands of ballots, right? Unsolicited ballots, being given out by the millions, and thousands of them are dumped in dumpsters. And when you see ballots with the name Trump, military ballots, from our great military. And they’re dumped in garbage cans- (22:01)
No, no, it’s happening every day. (22:11)
Oh, really? Well, then he’s not doing a very good job. All you have to do is pick up the papers every day. 50,000 in Ohio, the great state of Ohio. 50,000 in another location, I think North Carolina. 500,000 applications in Virginia. No, no, there’s a tremendous problem.(22:29)
But let me just tell you, they talk about the peaceful transfer, right? They spied on my campaign and they got caught. And they spied heavily, on my campaign. And they tried to take down a duly elected sitting president. And then, they talk about, “Will you accept a peaceful transfer?” And the answer is, yes, I will. But I want it to be an honest election. And so does everybody else. When I see thousands of ballots dumped in a garbage can, and they happen to have my name on it? I’m not happy about that. (23:05)
Could I ask you, how can you say that? (23:07)
How can you say that? You do read newspapers? (23:08)
You do watch the news? (23:09)
I know you read the news, but do you watch it? (23:12)
Because, every day, they’re talking about ballots that are corrupt, that are fraudulent. (23:18)
Sure. (23:21)
Sure, sure. But you can win a race… Take a look at me. You can win a race by 1%. (23:27)
I’m not, I don’t want that to happen. (23:31)
You know what? I don’t want that to happen. Savannah. I want it to be clean. (23:35)
And I want… I really feel we’re going to win, but I want this to be clean. (23:39)
But it’s sort of ironic that you, and them, talk about the peaceful transfer when I spent three and a half years fighting off these maniacs. And now, it turns out, everything’s there. That they were the ones that dealt with Russia, and it’s too bad. (23:55)
Peaceful transfer, I absolutely want that. But ideally, I don’t want to transfer, because I want to win. (24:19)
Sure.(24:19)
Good evening.(24:25)
How are you?(24:25)
Welcome to Miami.(24:25)
Thank you very much, it’s beautiful.(24:25)
Mr. President, if you knew COVID-19, as you told Bob Woodward in February-(24:32)
As what?(24:33)
As you told Bob Woodward in February, was airborne and deadlier than the flu, why did you only put in place a travel ban from China, and not put in place other measures mitigating the spread of COVID-19, potentially saving tens of thousands of American lives?(24:56)
Well, I did put it in very early, as you know, Joe Biden was two months behind me, and he called me xenophobic and racist and everything else, because I put it in. And it turned out that I was 100% right. I also put it on Europe, very early, because I saw there was a lot of infection in Europe. And it’s sort of an amazing question. And I appreciate the question, and respect the question, but the news doesn’t get out the right answer.(25:18)
Because I put on a travel ban far earlier than Dr. Fauci thought it was necessary. Who I like. Far earlier than the scientists… I was actually the only one that wanted to put it on. And I did it, actually against the advice of a lot of people, including Nancy Pelosi who had no clue what she was doing. And, Biden.(25:37)
When I put on the travel ban… You know, I put it on in January. The end of January. When I put on the travel ban Joe Biden, and others, said, “This is ridiculous. You don’t do that.” Well, Dr. Fauci said, I saved thousands and thousands of lives. (25:52)
I was early, I was extremely early, when I put on the travel ban. (26:03)
I read that, but no, he didn’t. (26:06)
I read it… I read it, someplace. Maybe Woodward said it, or something. But no, he did not say that. But, I knew it was a big threat. At the same time, I don’t want to panic this country. I don’t want to go out and say, “Everybody’s going to die. Everybody’s going to-” (26:21)
Okay? (26:23)
No, there’s not a middle ground. (26:25)
No, no. No. There’s not a middle ground. You have to be safe. You have to be vigilant, and you have to be smart. (26:29)
Okay. Good. (26:44)
We’ll talk you out of it. (26:48)
[Spanish, foreign language 00:26:48] Miami. (26:53)
Right. (27:05)
Right. (27:17)
Right. (27:25)
So, it’s happening. We just set a record, 11.4 million jobs. We are going to have a phenomenal third quarter, which will be announced on November 1st, just prior to the big November 3rd day, where I think you’re going to see a red wave. But we’re going to have a tremendous announcement. I believe. I mean, we’re going to find out, but GDP is going through the roof. Jobs, real estate, houses. So many things are happening.(27:49)
So, people were saying, we’re going to have a 42% unemployment. Look, this was a thing that came into our country and it happened a hundred, more than a hundred years ago, and it happened now. They were talking about a 42% unemployment rate. (28:05)
It came out, it just came out- (28:09)
… at 7.8% unemployment, and people can’t even believe it. Our economy is going to be… Next year, if we don’t have somebody that raises taxes and quadruples taxes, which they want to do, and it kills everything. Our economy is going to be phenomenal, next year. We’re going to have a phenomenal…(28:24)
And, I’ll tell you, Savannah. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country last year, including the state of Florida, where we are now. In Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, in Ohio, every place. We had the greatest economy we ever had. We had to close it down, we saved two million lives. We’re opening it up. We have a V-shape and it’s coming back. It’s coming back very fast.(28:45)
One other thing, we really helped the hospitals. We’ve sent billions and billions of dollars to the hospitals. In addition, hundreds of millions of masks and gowns. And we went into the ventilator business, because this country was not equipped with ventilators. And I’m not blaming anybody for it. But we’re now making thousands of ventilators a month, and we have all we can use. We’re sending them all over the world, because the world needs them. So, they’ve worked very hard and really very, very effectively. Thank you. Great question. (29:41)
No, because I was okay with the masks. I was good with it, but I’ve heard many different stories on masks. I had, being president, you have people, they bring meals, they bring this, they… And I had an instance recently, where a very wonderful person is bringing me a meal, and he’s playing with his mask. And he’s touching his mask, all over the place.(29:59)
And then he’s bringing a plate in, and I’m saying, “Well, I don’t know if that’s so good.” I mean, the good news, I didn’t eat it. Okay? I decided not to eat it. This was a month ago. But I… Look, look, you have, on the masks, you have two stories. You have a story where they want, a story where they don’t want. I am all for it. (30:21)
Some. No. (30:23)
No, the [crosstalk 00:30:25]. (30:35)
And then, you have other people that disagree. (30:39)
Scott Atkins, if you look at Scott, Dr. Scott. He’s from, great guy, Stanford. He will tell you that, he disagrees with you. (30:45)
Oh, I don’t know. Look, he’s an expert. He’s one of the great experts of the world. (30:51)
I’m all for it. (30:53)
By the way- (30:54)
I never said, “Don’t wear them.” (30:57)
Savannah, University of Washington. And then, you have other places, say different things. You have a lot of… Hey. Dr. Fauci said, “Don’t wear a mask,” right? (31:07)
Oh, I don’t know. Then he changed his mind. But then, you have a report coming out two days ago, that 85% of the people wearing masks catch it. (31:17)
Savannah. We’re on the same side. I say, wear the mask. I’m fine with it. (31:20)
I have no problem. We’re on the same side. (31:24)
Thank you.(31:24)
(silence). (35:06)
Thank you. Thank you very much. (35:29)
Good. So we got rid of the individual mandate on Obamacare, which was the worst part of Obamacare, and now you could actually say it’s not Obamacare because that’s how big it was, where you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, so we got rid of that. That was a big, big thing. And by doing that, and we will always have… By the way, we’re always protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and I can’t say that more strongly, but we’ve been able to bring healthcare costs way down. Now, I took over Obamacare, got rid of the individual mandate, made it good, managed it much better. Remember, they had the $5 billion website disaster, and all of the problems they had. The problem with Obamacare, it’s not good. We’d like to terminate it, and we want a much less expensive healthcare that’s a much better healthcare, and that’s where we’re aiming. And if we can do that, and we have a very good chance of doing it, but we’ve also brought down the price of Obamacare. The problem with Obamacare, it basically is never going to be great, and I want to give great healthcare. So important. And thank you very much. (36:39)
It is a big issue for me too. (36:50)
That’s right. That’s right. (36:54)
In order to replace it with a much better healthcare at a much lower price. And always, under all circumstances, we are going to protect the Republicans. And maybe I changed the party a lot over the last three years, but we will protect people with preexisting conditions. And Savannah, what I want to do, get rid of the terrible Obamacare. I’ve already done it to a large extent because as you know, the individual mandate is gone. That was the worst part. (37:23)
No, no. (37:26)
We have done- (37:33)
That’s right. I’m sorry, but if you look, we had both houses and what did we do? We got rid of the individual mandate. That went through the legislature. (37:40)
Look, look. We should be on the same side. I wanted very simple. I’m going to put it very simple. We would like to terminate it, and we would like to replace it with something that’s much less expensive and much better. We will always protect people with preexisting conditions. (37:59)
And here’s the thing- (38:00)
If we don’t succeed, we are running the remnants of whatever’s left because we took it apart. We are running the remnants of whatever’s left much better than the previous administration, which ran it very badly, but we’d like to have new healthcare much better and much less expensive. (38:43)
Well, we’ve actually passed three packages, and we’re on our fourth, and I agree with him 100%. He should vote for me. The problem you have is Nancy Pelosi. She couldn’t care less about the worker. She couldn’t care less about our people. And we should have a stimulus, and I want a stimulus. The Republicans will approve a stimulus. The problem is she doesn’t want to do it because she thinks it’s bad for her election. The fact is, she’s wrong because people know she’s in our way, she’s not approving it, she doesn’t appreciate our people, and she doesn’t appreciate, at all, our workers. Nancy Pelosi, we are ready to sign and pass stimulus, but she’s got to approve it. (39:38)
That’s right. (39:59)
That’s right. Did you ever hear a word called negotiation when negotiating? Okay. I’m negotiating- (39:59)
You know what? And you know who I’m negotiating against? Nancy Pelosi, because she doesn’t want to give them money. We should have stimulus. This was not our people’s fault. This was China’s fault. And she’s penalizing our people. I’m ready to sign a big, beautiful stimulus. You saw the other day, I said, “Go big or go home.” Right? (40:15)
I want it to be big. I want it to be bold. I want the money to go to directly to the people. (40:22)
They’ll go. Yeah, they’ll go. They’ll go. They’re going be very active- (40:24)
I know, because I haven’t asked them to because I can’t get through Nancy Pelosi. (40:28)
If Nancy Pelosi and I, through my representatives or directly, I don’t care, if we agree to something, the Republicans will agree to it. (40:52)
How are you? (40:53)
Nice to see you. Thank you. (41:20)
It’s a great question. We’ve created more jobs than this country has ever created. We were up to 160 million jobs. We were never even close to that number. We were just hitting 160 million jobs, companies are pouring into our nation because of the tax rate, and if Biden comes in and raises taxes on everybody, including middle income taxes, which he wants to do, you will blow this thing, and you’ll end up with a depression, the likes of which you’ve never had. That’s what’s going to happen. We have something that’s really good. The reason we’re coming back so strong is because we built a very strong foundation. Companies are moving in. Car companies are moving into Michigan, into Ohio, into South Carolina, and North Carolina just today, so what’s happening is, they’re coming in because we reduced the taxes. Our taxes, our corporate taxes were the highest in the world, and now they’re among the lower taxes. They’re not the lowest, but they’re among the lowest. And what that means, is jobs, but also we’re doing a very big, and we’ve done a very big, middle income tax package. So if we get in, we’re going to do the middle income tax package, but it’s a great question. And if he comes along and raises rates, all those companies that are coming in, they will leave the U.S. so fast your head will spin. We can’t let that happen. Thank you. (42:53)
Okay, first of all, let me answer. What they did is illegal, number one. Also, the numbers are all wrong, with the numbers they released. And just so you understand, when you have a lot of real estate, I have real estate, you know a lot of it. Okay? Right down the road, Doral, big stuff, great stuff. When I decided to run, I’m very underlevered, fortunately, but I’m very underlevered. I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared. In fact, some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money. $400 million compared to the assets that I have, all of these great properties all over the world, and frankly, The Bank of America building in San Francisco. I don’t love what’s happening to San Francisco. 1290 Avenue of the Americas, one of the biggest office buildings. (43:47)
What I’m saying is that, it’s a tiny percentage of my net worth. (43:51)
And you’ll see that soon because we’re doing things. We’ve given, I think it’s 108 or 112 pages of financial detail to elections, and we have to file as the president, as any politician, you have to file. Nobody ever looks at that. When they do, they see how incredible a company is, but more importantly, they see where this debt is. No, I don’t owe Russia money. I owe a very, very small… It’s called mortgages. People have a house, they put a mortgage. (44:21)
Not that I know of, but I will probably, because it’s so easy to solve, and if you’d like to do, I will let you know who I owe, whatever small amount of money. I want to say two things. Number one, it’s a very small amount of money. Number two, it’s very straight. It’s very, very straight, but it’s a tiny percentage of the worth. Did you ever hear the expression underlevered? (44:44)
I am extremely underlevered. (44:53)
As you know, I’m under audit. It turned out that I am under audit. (44:55)
But they actually… Excuse me. No, no. (44:59)
But you accused me of not being under audit previously. (45:02)
And so did other people at NBC. And I am under audit. (45:06)
So that one’s solved. That’s good. I am under audit. No person in their right mind would release, prior to working out the deal with the IRS. And I’ll go a step further. I’m treated very badly by the IRS. They treat me very, very badly. You have people in there from previous administrations that treat me very badly, but we’re under audit. It’s very routine, in many ways, but we’re under audit. They like to change the game, change the rules, do everything. You saw what they did with the tea party people. You saw what they did with the religious group. (45:40)
No, except common sense, and intelligence, and having lawyers that say… Because I would love to release them, and as soon as we come to a conclusion, I will release them, and very gladly, but if you go to elections, and if you take a look, you’ll see 112, I think it’s 112, it talks about the income, which is rather massive. It talks about all of the properties. They have them listed. You can never learn more, but you know what happened? People went there. All the reporters went. There was a feeding frenzy. This was originally, when I filed it. And I filed it every year. I update it every year. My son is here. They run the company. I don’t run the company. (46:21)
Yeah, because that’s a statutory number. It’s a statutory. (46:25)
I think it’s a filing number. You pay 750, it’s a filing or a filing fee. (46:31)
No, I don’t know. I can tell you this. If they have my tax returns, as you know, they have to go to jail. It’s illegal, but their numbers were wrong, but let me tell you what else. I don’t owe money to any of these sinister people. This has been going on for years now. Russia, Russia, Russia. It turned out to be a hoax, and it turned out to be that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were dealing with Russia, not me. It’s a whole hoax. So I would not mind at all saying who it is, but it’s a very small… When you look at vast properties like I have, and they’re big, and they’re beautiful, and they’re well located. When you look at that, the amount of money, $400 million is a peanut. It’s extremely underlevered. And it’s levered with normal banks. Not a big deal. (47:20)
Thank you. Thank you. (51:04)
Thank you. (51:15)
Thank you, Adam. (51:37)
So when I was elected, and when a president is elected, they’re elected for a period of four years. And Justice Ginsburg said it best. I think, talking about president Obama having to do with somebody else, that the president is put there for four years, not for three years. So during this fourth year, it happened to come up, unfortunately, because I had great respect for Justice Ginsburg. But a vacancy happened to come up, and we picked somebody that’s outstanding. She has been an absolute star, and I’m extremely proud of it. But again, plenty of time.(52:10)
There’s plenty of time. We’re going to do it before the election, but we also have much time after the election. But there’s no reason to wait, because it’s almost unanimous, it seems to me, certainly within the Republican party. And frankly, most of the Democrats within closed rooms, I guarantee you that. This is an outstanding person, and I’m using my fourth term. And if you look at it and if you put the shoe on the other foot, if they had this, they would do it 100%. So there’s been 29 times when this has happened. All 29 times a president has done exactly what I’ve done. (53:04)
So I have a lot of respect, by the way, for- (53:07)
I have a lot of respect for Judge Garland. I want to tell you that. But I’ll tell you, the whole ball game changed when I saw the way they treated Justice Kavanaugh. I have never seen any human being, and I’m not just talking about Supreme Court… I have never seen a human being treated so badly with false accusations and everything else. I have never seen anything like it. And you know what the truth is, Savannah? Like it or not, the ball game changed a lot. There has never been anybody treated so badly as, now Justice Kavanaugh. (53:49)
Well, I think she’ll have to make that decision. I don’t think she has any conflict at all. A Supreme Court judge does not have… They can make their own decision. They actually have additional power to make that decision. It would be totally up to her. I would think that she would be able to rule either for me or against me, being I don’t see any conflict whatsoever. We have an election coming up. I think it’s the most important election in the history of our country. If for any chance, and it probably won’t… And I hope it doesn’t ever get to the Supreme Court. But if it did, I would think that she would rule one way or the other. I would think so. (54:28)
I have no idea. (54:31)
Because believe it or not, I never asked her about it. I never talked about it. I didn’t talk about any of the obvious things that you could talk about. And I think a lot of people in my position might. But in speaking to a lot of very brilliant people and people that do this for a living, they say it’s better not to talk. So I talked to her about life. I talked to her about the fact, “Would you like to do this? Are you willing to do this?” Because it’s a tremendous burden. The answer was, “Yes.” She’s unbelievably well-qualified, but I never spoke to her about these various questions. (55:13)
Thank you very much. (55:36)
Well, again, I’m not ruling on this. And Roe v. Wade is something that a lot of people would say, obviously, you’re going to speak to somebody. Also two other great Justices, Justice Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh… I never spoke to them about Roe v. Wade. I never spoke to them about election laws. I never spoke to them about anything. And I’ve done the right thing from a moral standpoint. I don’t even know from a legal standpoint, but it was the right thing. I think, depending on what happens with Roe v. Wade, I think that perhaps it could get sent down to the states, and the states would decide. I also think perhaps nothing will happen. I have not talked to her about it. I think it would be inappropriate to talk to her about it. And some people would say, “You can talk to about it.” I just think it would be inappropriate. (56:31)
I would like to see a brilliant jurist, a brilliant person who has done this in great depth and has actually skirted this issue for a long time, make a decision. And that’s why I chose her. I think that she’s going to make a great decision. I did not tell her what decision to make. And I think it would be inappropriate to say right now, because I don’t want to do anything to influence her. I want her to get approved, and then I want her to go by the law. And I know she’s going to make a great decision for our country, along with the other two people I put there. (57:09)
Many of them would. Perhaps most of them would. I am telling you, I don’t want to do anything to influence anything right now. I don’t want to go out tomorrow and say, “Oh, he’s trying to give her a signal.” Because I didn’t speak to her about it. I’ve done the right thing in so doing. How she’s going to rule, you’re going to find out perhaps. Or you might not find out. It may never get there. It may never get there. We’ll see what happens. (57:44)
Hi, Cindy. Thank you. (57:45)
Thank you very much. (58:20)
Right. I fully understand the question, and I saw everything that you saw over the summer. And it was a terrible thing, a terrible thing to watch. We have a Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina. He came up with a bill that should have been approved. It was great. It was a bill that was strong in terms of law enforcement, and strong in terms of enforcing the proper thing, and doing the proper thing by law enforcement. And the Democrats just wouldn’t go for it. They wouldn’t go for it at all. And I don’t know why, because it was a really great bill. But I do have to say this. And some people don’t like it when I say it, but a lot of people agree. I have done more for the African American community than any president. With the exception of Abraham Lincoln. Criminal justice reform, prison reform, historically Black colleges and universities. I got them funded.(59:12)
They were on a year to year basis. They could have been put out of business. As soon as our country had a little bad year, they would have said, “I’m sorry, we’re not going to fund you.” I got them 10 year funding and financing. And more than they even asked for. I became very friendly with a lot of the heads. But we’ve done more… And of course, opportunity zones. But criminal justice reform, everybody said it could not be done. President Obama and Biden never even tried to do it. They never even tried. But I say that, and I say it often. I’ll say it loud, and I’m very proud of it. And I have a great relationship because of what I’ve done with the African-American community. I’m very proud of it. (01:00:00)
Thank you. Thank you very much. (01:00:04)
Got you. Thank you. (01:00:25)
Right. (01:00:51)
Yeah. (01:00:54)
DACA is somewhat different than Dreamers. You understand that, and you understand it better than anybody, probably, in this room. Where do you come from, by the way, originally? Where? (01:01:05)
That’s very good. Okay. So we are going to take care of DACA. We’re going to take care of Dreamer. It’s working right now. We’re negotiating different aspects of immigration and immigration law. We’ve built now, over 400 miles of border wall, southern border. Mexico is working very closely with us. We have the strongest border we’ve ever had. We want people to come into our country. They have to come in legally. But we are working very hard on the DACA program. And you will be, I think, very happy over the course of the next year. (01:01:39)
Because I feel the same way as you do about it. (01:01:41)
Thank you. Thank you very much. (01:01:59)
Well, what happens is because of the pandemic, much changed on the immigration front. Mexico is heavily infected, as you know. And we’ve made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic, and other reasons, and crime. But we have a very strong border right now, and we have to keep it that way. But we want people to come into our country, but they have to come in through a merit system, and they have to come in legally. And people are very, very happy with it. You haven’t heard any complaints about that. But what happened is because of the pandemic, we have to be extra cautious. (01:02:39)
It’s very happy. The fact is, we got rid of catch and release, which is a disaster. You catch somebody. They could be a murderer. That could be a rapist, and we’re supposed to release them into our country. These are the laws that I inherited. We ended that program. Now, I think you’re going to see something very, very good. The whole immigration… If you look at what’s going on, people used to pour into our country. And especially during the pandemic, I think even you, Savannah, will be very impressed with what we’ve done. (01:03:07)
Sure. (01:03:16)
That’s right. (01:03:25)
Because I’ve done a great job. We have the strongest economy in the world. We closed it up. We are coming around the corner. The vaccines are coming out soon, and our economy is strong. We are at a level with jobs like we’ve never been before. We’ve rebuilt our military. We’ve rebuilt our borders. We had no borders. We had no nothing. We’ve rebuilt so much. We’ve given you the greatest tax cut in the history of our country. Greatest regulation cut, equally as important. And we created new levels of jobs that nobody thought was possible. And next year is going to be better than ever before. (01:04:05)
Thank you very much."
trump_tucker_carlson.txt,"(01:06)
Okay. (01:08)
Sounds good to me, Marc. (01:16)
I feel really good. I feel very strong. I know a lot of people that have had the COVID or the China viruses I call it because it came from China, but I feel really, really strong. And a lot of people don’t feel that way sometimes for a while afterwards, but very good. (01:41)
I think didn’t feel strong. I didn’t have a problem with breathing, which a lot of people seem to have. I had none of that, but I didn’t feel very strong. I didn’t feel very vital. I didn’t feel like the president of the U.S. should feel, and I knew there was something a little bit off. And the doctors at Walter Reed were incredible. They came from Johns Hopkins. They came from everywhere. It’s good to be president, I guess, but they were really great people, but I would say more weakness than anything else Marc. (02:25)
I did negotiate, but ultimately I have a lot of respect for these doctors. They’re really the best doctors, I think in the world and Walter Reed, I’ve seen the work they do in the military and people coming in so badly injured like you’ve never seen before. I have a lot of respect, so I really tended to listen, but generally, maybe I wouldn’t, but I did tend to listen to this group. (02:52)
I just think that you were tired. It was just getting to you from the stand point you didn’t have that same energy level. And my life is based a little bit on energy and you didn’t have it. And I don’t know, it could have led to bad things from that point. I don’t know, but I got lucky, I think with a certain medicine, but it really was something. I took a certain medicine that was very miraculous to me. I think I really don’t believe it’s just in the head either. I really believe it worked. (03:31)
Well, I took the Regeneron and Eli Lilly makes a very similar medicine, but you have Regeneron, you have the Eli Lilly version of it. And within a period of 24 hours, I felt very different. I think I could have left the hospital a lot earlier, but it made a tremendous difference Marc, and markedly so, and I just felt very good. You would have sort of a sore throat just to add to what we were saying, but I felt really very, very good after taking this for a period of time, it’s a transfusion, not a shot. And I’d like to send it to everybody. In fact, I’ve said, I’m going to send it to everybody that’s got the problem and we’re going to send it free of charge, including seniors, of course, but we’re going to send it to everybody. (04:29)
I did. (04:31)
They wanted to keep me for observation. They wanted to be sure it was good, but I did. I was there for, I guess three and a half days. They wanted to keep me, I wanted to leave after the first day, I really felt I was in not bad shape after the first day. I think I would have been a much worse shape had I not taken this medication. (04:53)
I don’t know exactly, but they kept me for the time I stayed for the time that they needed me. And they’ve done a lot of tests. They’ve done tremendous testing. And right now I’m medication free. I’m not taking any medications as of probably eight hours ago or so, I’m medication free, which frankly makes me feel good. I don’t like medication. (05:24)
Yeah, they tested the lungs. They have incredible equipment at Walter Reed. In fact, they said, no, you could leave your jacket on. That’s the first that’s ever happened. Leave your shirt on, leave your jacket on. I said, “I’ll take it off anyway, if you want.” But literally, they tested the lungs, they checked for the lungs and they tested it with different machinery. They have incredible stuff that I’ve never even seen before. And it tested good. Initially, I think they had some congestion in there, but ultimately it tested good and with each day it got better. And I think that’s why they wanted me to stay, frankly, but the CAT scans were amazing. The equipment was incredible. I’ve never seen equipment like this before. (06:42)
Well, I had tremendous numbers of people, I could hear them from the hospital and I was way up high in this very fortified military hospital that’s built to the highest standard. And yet through these very powerful windows, I could hear people screaming and shouting and with love, with real love. And after two days, I said, “I want to go out and say hello to the people.” And I went to secret service, and these are the people that are with me all the time. And they said, “We have no problem, sir.” I said, “I just want to take a drive by them and just wave.”(07:13)
And you saw what happened. It was a great display of love out there. I don’t think there was one negative person and there were many, many, many people, but I don’t think there was anybody negative out there. They went crazy when they saw the car go by. And the people in were protected, they were very heavily protected because at that time, I guess I would have been positive, but they were very, very protected. And they’ve been with me for a long time and they understand, but they also thought it was very important. I thought it was very important to show my affection for them. They were standing out there 24 hours a day, you saw that. I mean, every time you’d be on television, you see them in the background.(07:58)
And I just thought, I love the people, I love the people of this country. And I thought it would have been very disrespectful if I was there for three and a half days. And these people are there standing late at night, early in the morning and I didn’t go out and at least give them a little wave. And that’s what I did, and I’m very glad I did it. (08:37)
It’s such a great question. I think the biggest thing is that I did do it early. Now, I have such great access to medical. We have a white house doctor, who’s great. And you have so many great doctors. So it’s a lot easier for me than somebody that doesn’t have access to a doctor so easily where it’s a big deal to see a doctor, but here we have them all over the white house, frankly, they’re watching every corner. But I think very important for me was very early, as soon as I felt something and I’m thinking about it because I see what’s going on and a lot of people are around me, even though there’s tremendous testing, but a lot of people are around me.(09:14)
So I think about it and I know there’s a danger, but I can’t be somebody that goes into a basement and just hides in a basement for the rest of my life. I’m running a country, the greatest country in the world. So what I think the big secret for me was I got there very early and I think it would have gotten a lot worse. One of the doctors said he thought it would have gotten a lot worse. I just think that even these medications, there are lot better if you get them early than if you get them late, it will react probably better. So I think going in early is a big factor in my case. (10:05)
No, I didn’t even know I had it. I didn’t know what it was. It’s a form of a steroid, but it keeps the swelling down of the lungs as I understand it. And I tolerated it very well. I don’t take it anymore, but it was a pretty short term during the course of the medicine, that was one of the medicines and no, I think I tolerated it very well, Marc, and it keeps the swelling down. And that’s important. (10:35)
I think really nothing. We pretty much finished and now we’ll see how things go, but pretty much nothing. We had our final doses of just about everything. Actually, the original transfusion that’s supposed to last for about four months, the antibodies, and I think you’re supposed to be protected anywhere from two to four months. And maybe longer than that, I don’t know. (11:02)
Well, I will. Nobody’s asked me that question actually, but I will. If they want me to do it, I’d love to do it. (11:15)
I have been retested and I haven’t even found out numbers or anything yet, but I’ve been retested and I know I’m at either the bottom of the scale or free. (11:26)
I don’t know. Probably tomorrow, Marc. They test every couple of days, I guess, but it’s really at a level now, that’s been great to see it disappear. (11:52)
Well, I’d have no trouble with it at all. In fact, where we have rallies outside, we’ve had no problem whatsoever. Outside is better than inside as you know with this crazy thing that’s going on. But I would have no problem with it. But we’ve always had a problem with this commission. This commission has been ridiculous, frankly, but who wants to do a debate on a computer? I don’t. Virtual debate no, you got to be there. We degraded the last debate. You have to be there. You have to see the person, you can’t do it on a computer. Besides that, Joe has a tendency to get the answers and read them off a computer for when he’s asked questions. So I would love to do it outside would be fine as far as I’m concerned. (12:39)
I don’t know. They had some big events at the white house and perhaps there, I don’t really know. Nobody really knows for sure. Numerous people have contracted it, but people have contracted it all over the world. It’s highly contagious. That’s one thing you learn, this is a contagious disease, and generally you get better from it, but we also now have medicines that will help a lot. And if you look at mortality rate, I think it’s up 95 or 85%. Marc, I think you’ve seen that you pointed it out to me. What we’re doing now with the medicines and all of the things is incredible, but especially younger people, I wished they open schools, I hope they opened schools. Some of the States are closed and the cure is worse than the problem itself in many cases, it’s a terrible thing. (13:41)
I just have such great respect for the doctors and lab scientists, the people that work on this, they’re doing incredibly well. I have incredible respect and love for the families that have suffered so badly. This is something that came to us out of… I don’t know, I won’t be able to tell you yet. Maybe at some point I’ll be able to report exactly why it came to us, but it came out of China. It shouldn’t have happened. They should have never let it happen, but they suffered plenty also far more than people understand, but this is something that should not have been allowed this to come out to the world, not only to the United States to the world.(14:20)
But I have such respect for the people that have suffered and my sympathies to those families that have been so horribly hurt and just horribly hurt. And again, the respect for the doctors and for the technicians and for the scientists is incredible because I’ve seen what they’ve done. And it’s incredible the job that they’ve done in a short period of time, over a six month period the job that they’ve done is incredible. And you’ll see that very soon with the medicines and with the vaccines. (15:04)
Well, thank you very much, Marc. It’s my great honor. Thank you."
trump_vandalia_speech.txt,"(07:55)
Well thank you very much, Ohio. Thank you very much. Thank you. You know, this is really not a rally, you know this, this has to do with workers, programs, all the things we love, but this is really, we call it a friendly protest. And you know what we’re protesting? We’re protesting stupidity. Because there’s so many stupid things you see here. But hello, I’ll tell you what Ohio, how good have you been? How good have you been? What did we win by? A lot. And your governor’s here, and he just said you’re winning by a lot more this time than last time. So that’s good. Thank you. Mike, thank you very much. But hello, Ohio. And thank you very much. I’m thrilled to be here in Dayton, the home of the Wright Brothers, wow. I wonder what they would think when they see some of these F-35s and these crazy planes that we make nowadays that go thousands of miles an hour, right? I wonder.(08:58)
But I want to just thank the very hard working patriots who are the backbone of America. You really are. You’re the backbone of America. This is an amazing group of people. This is an amazing group. You know, I’m going to another very nice spot in Ohio where we do have a rally, but I can’t imagine you have many more people than we have here, but they will, about 10 times more. No, this is for us and our friends and workers. We want workers. 43 days from now, We are going to win this state. We are going to win four more years in the White House. That’s true. (09:48)
Thank you. Thank you. You had your best year in the history of your state and the history of our country last year. And we had it until the plague came in, and now we’re building it up again rapidly, but you had the best year, and we’re going to have… next year will be the best year we’ve ever had. I believe that. You’ll see that in the third quarter. But we’re here today to talk about jobs. We’re talking about jobs, a very favorite subject of mine to know and to understand that the choice in November is going to be very simple. There’s never been a time where there’s such a difference. One is probably communism. I don’t know. They keep saying socialism. I think they’re gone. They’ve got over that one, that one’s passed already. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping your jobs to China, and foreign countries. You know that. (10:41)
And I’ve spent the last four years bringing the jobs back to our country, and back to Ohio. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we lift our nation to soaring new heights of prosperity, or whether we will allow a Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe, to shut down our economy, impose a four trillion, that’s with a T, by the way, $4 trillion tax hike, abolish Ohio clean coal, oil, natural gas, and ship your jobs and factories and dreams overseas to China and countries that you’ve never even heard of. Put simply, if Biden wins, China wins. If we win, Ohio wins, and most importantly, in all fairness, America wins. Because you finally have a president who puts America first. And I do put America first. I guess that’s why almost four years ago, that’s why I did this, right? It’s because of this, probably more than any other reason. I watched the jobs going out. I never saw anything so stupid in my life. I watched the worst trade deals, and we’ve reversed many of them, almost all of them now, but we’ve reversed them.(12:03)
And again, we were having the greatest year we’ve ever had, and it’s going to be back very soon. You take a look at what’s happening. We’re joined today by a real good friend of mine. Somebody that’s been with me from the beginning. And I’ve been with him from the beginning, Ohio Governor, Mike DeWine. Where’s Mike? Where’s Mike? He’s opening up. Where’s Mike? Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike. He’s a good man. And Lieutenant governor John Euston. Good guys. Yeah. Thanks John. Good job. Congressman Warren Davidson, do you know Warren? Wow. Warren, that’s very impressive. These are real warriors. I’ll tell you another one, Mike Turner. Do we know Mike? Hell of a lawyer. Thank you, Mike. Thanks for all the help too, both of you, really appreciate it. And a man, I don’t know if you know him. He should become legendary, because when we didn’t have a lot of support, I had a guy named Bob Paduchik, do you know Bob? He kept saying, every time I said, “You know, we’re not getting the kind of support from the top people.” He said, “That’s okay, sir, you went up another two points.”(13:28)
We won this state by a lot. Remember the fake news. It’s a lot of it back there too, a lot of fake news. But they were going around Mike, hey Mike, they were going around saying, “Well, Trump may not be able to, in order to when you have to win Ohio, right? And then for a year, I heard, “You cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio.” But they didn’t say the great state, I say the great state. And I heard it. I heard it for so long. It would be impossible. And then we won that night by what? Nine points? What was it Bob? Nine points. We won by a lot. In fact, it was the first indication that that was going to be a tough night for the Democrats. They said, “Ladies and gentlemen, not only did Trump win Ohio, he won by a hell of a lot more than we anticipated.” And then we won, look at these guys. That’s why I love these guys. Look at this. Nobody’s messing with these guys. You know, they’re great workers, but we use them also for security. If everyone gets a little bit rough, you’ll take care, right fellas? Thank you very much. Thank you. But we won it big, and that was the beginning of one of the most exciting nights in history, because we did something in 2016 that was amazing. And I’ll tell you, honestly, there is more enthusiasm now, and this is fact. In fact, they have a new thing. First of all, you know, we’re working very hard on getting a third Supreme Court Justice. I’m going to announce who that is. The only thing I’ll say, for the women, it will be a woman. Uh oh. There are a lot of angry people. Okay. Here’s the question. Okay. It will be a woman. Does anybody here, please raise your hand if you have the courage, is there anybody here that insists that it will be and should be a man? Is there anybody with the courage, please put up your hand right now. A lot of women here.(15:44)
So, okay. Ready? Supreme Court Justice, most powerful, most important, just the most important, you know, when you become president, they say, “This is the single most important thing a president does, is pick Supreme Court… ” And by the way, by the end of the first term, we will have 300 federal judges, a record. So let’s give me a free poll. We do this, I have such fun with it. We do it. Give me a free poll. If they go out, they charge hundreds of thousands of dollars. They interview like 19 people, which mean nothing. Here we got a lot of people. So give me a free poll, who would like to see a woman Justice of the Supreme Court. Who would like to see a male Justice of the Supreme Court. The only one I hear there is women. Some women. What’s that all about? No, it will be a brilliant person. It will be, I have five that we’re vetting right now. It’ll be a brilliant person. It will be a woman. It will be a woman. And we’re looking forward to it.(17:00)
And it will probably announce it on Saturday, maybe Friday, but Saturday. And it’s a big day for our country. It’s a big day for you. It’s a big day for Ohio. And so I think it will be great. I always love, why’d you say that? Like big day for Ohio, and I do it somewhat routinely. Do you ever notice when Biden goes out, and he always picks the wrong location. Like if he’s in Ohio, it’s great to be in the state of Florida. And he looks around, and he doesn’t see too many palm trees. He says, “Are we in Florida?” “No, you’re not.” He did that seven times. How do you do that? When you do that, you just walk off the stage. It’s over. There’s nothing you can do. You can make the greatest remainder of the speech, there’s nothing you can do to save it. But the people of Dayton know better than anyone, the terrible damage that Biden has inflicted over his nearly 50 years, 47 years to be exact. Can you believe it? For 47 years, Joe Biden shook the hands of American workers, and then stabbed them in the back.(18:03)
He said, “Washington vultures.” I mean, think of it, all over, and they raked in cash. They raked in big money. Where’s his son? Where is he? Where’s his son? I’ll tell you. Where is he? What did I say, “Where is,” Where is he? Go ahead. You know, we did that for fun. Where’s Hunter? We did a t-shirt. That thing sold, we come up with these little gems. Where’s Hunter? You know where he is? Yeah. He’s in the basement with his father. Where’s Hunter? No, Hunter did very well. He had no job, he was thrown out of the military, he was thrown out. He had no job. And then he goes to Ukraine, and he gets $183,000 a month. Although he had no experience whatsoever, knew nothing about the subject of the company, which you know, was energy. I think they got an upfront payment of three million…(19:03)
… energy. I think they got an upfront payment of three million just to be able to get them. Think of that, $183,000 a month and three million dollar upfront payment. How about that? I’d take that one myself. Then they go to China, he walks out with one point five billion to manage, which is millions of dollars a year. The whole thing is crazy and the fake news doesn’t want to cover it. They don’t want to cover it. Did you see the interview the other day with Anderson Cooper, the other night? That was softball, that was like, “Here, Joe.” So we’ll see. We have a debate coming up and who knows, look he’s been doing this … You know what, he’s been doing it for 47 years. I’ve been doing it for three and a half years, so he should be able to beat me I would think, he’s much more experienced. He’s great, oh, he’s a beauty. But he betrayed you, he lied to you, he abused you, which is why it’s time to retire Joe Biden, this is serious stuff. Do we have any Teamsters here? Teamsters, any Teamsters here? That’s all? One. All right, well, I did a big favor for the Teamsters, they had trucking company. I think 30,000 jobs going out. James Hoffa called up, “Could you help? Could you help? Could you help?” I helped, I kept that company going. They saved 30,000 jobs, but then every year they always endorse the Democrat, doesn’t matter, good or bad. And James Hoffa, I’m so disappointed in that guy. So I called, I said, “I’d love to get their support.” “Oh, I’m sorry, sir. They’ve already endorsed sleepy Joe Biden.” It’s like automatic, but you know who doesn’t endorse him, all the workers underneath and they’ll either throw him out or he’ll retire. He’ll retire. You get tired of it, it’s like automatic. They endorse the Democrat because the Democrats do whatever the hell they want. But the workers, the people underneath, the real people, they’re with us all the way.(21:15)
I’ve hired thousands and thousands of Teamsters, all the concrete work on buildings in Manhattan. But they just like wedded. It’s almost like a habit. I consider it a habit and I think it’s disgraceful. But I saved this company, a big company, good company, great people. We saved it. And then you say unrelated, totally unrelated, “Hey, we’d love to have you.” “Well, I’m sorry, it’s already done.” These people are terrible, but that’s all right. You always have to remember things. Remember, you got to remember, right workers? On November 3rd, we must turn the page forever on the failed corrupt political class. That’s what it is. They get so much things that are so unfair to the rest of our country and that’s why they’re always with that top level of Democrat but the workers are with us.(22:04)
Biden is a diehard globalist. Globalists are out, you know that right? Globalist destroyed, they helped destroy this country. I’ll tell you if I didn’t come along, I really mean it. This country was, it was going down and we stopped it. If you look at your Second Amendment, if you look at so many different things, no matter what it is. You look at our jobs, our jobs prior to the plague and now coming back. The housing is record setting. Car manufacturing is record setting. You take a look at car sales are record setting. Retailing, who would think retail is record setting. It’s amazing because we had such a good foundation. We closed it up, we saved millions of lives. We had no choice, we had to do that. And then we opened it and now we’re rocking and it’s going good. It’s really going good.(22:58)
But the Democrats really waged war on the American workers for half a century. Look what they’ve done. Biden’s policies destroyed 60,000 factories and killed four point, think of it, four point five million manufacturing jobs. We brought back 700,000 when they said, right, they said the magic wand, you can’t do it, manufacturing jobs are gone. I said, “Really? I don’t think so.” Biden championed the NAFTA disaster and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which was a total catastrophe. That’s when China started going up like a rocket. They’re considered in the world trade, they’re considered a developing nation. No, they’re not a developing nation. By being a developing nation they get all sorts of advantages over us. So we’ve been protesting it and we do things that you wouldn’t believe. You don’t even want to hear about it because it’s disgraceful. China is a developing nation. And therefore for years and years, they had big advantages over the United States but no more.(24:02)
What followed was the nothing short, and think of it, nothing short of a blue collar carnage and it was in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, New Hampshire, Michigan. You know how many car plants we’re bringing back to Michigan. Nobody’s ever seen it. For 40 years, they didn’t build a plant. And now they’re building them all over. And I tell countries, I told a great gentleman, he just retired, Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I said, “Shinzo, you got to build plants here, you can’t do this. You’re building your cars in Japan and sending them. We want our cars built here. We want cars built here.” He said, “Well, that’s not up to me, that’s up to the company.” “That’s all right, Shinzo, I know you can do it.” The next day they announced five plants, I mean, what can I tell you?(24:50)
I know my people, it’s up to Shinzo, it wasn’t up to anybody else, but he’s great. The workers of America will never forget Biden’s economic treachery. They will remember in November after Biden betrayed and think of it, all the betrayals on NAFTA and China, 40% of all of the manufacturing jobs were shipped out of Dayton. And now the good thing is your roads, you didn’t have a lot of traffic. So that’s the good news, everything else was bad, right? It was everything else was bad. 30,000 Dayton families saw their jobs disappear overnight. By 2016, the per capita income in Dayton had fallen 12% below the national average of $50,000. Remember this, this all happened … I mean, these numbers are incredible what’s happened in three years. Ohio lost one in three manufacturing jobs, two out of three iron and steel mill jobs. And half of its auto jobs, courtesy of Joe Biden and that crew, that group, that whole ideology.(25:57)
And now of course his ideology has changed. He’s so far left that he is … just so you understand, he has no choice. It’s not him. He’s being pulled left. You see where Kamala, Kamala, she another great one that one. You see her poll numbers, her poll numbers were going down and I can’t … nobody treated him worse than Kamala, right? And she said the Harris administration and working with Joe Biden, did you see that? But he said worse, he said the Harris, right, he said the Harris, Biden administration. And I heard that, I actually heard that live, although it’s not real live, I’ll tell you. It’s sort of half gone, it’s shot, it’s shot. But he said the Harris, Biden administration will … and that’s where it is. Look, this guy is shot. I mean, if he makes it, it’s going to be … I’m going to come back to Dayton and I’m going to say what the hell happened?(26:58)
I will have lost to the worst presidential candidate in the history of politics. I really believe that. The guy can’t speak without the teleprompter, although I’m telling you, I’m telling you, I think … she says [inaudible 00:27:10]. I hope you’re right. I hope you’re … Thank you. I hope you’re right. I tell you the country can’t afford it. One thing I’ve learned is that President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un, North Korea, every one of these leaders, they’re not shot. And we can’t have somebody that’s sleepy. We can’t have a sleepy guy negotiating. Oh, would they like to see him though? Did you see, would they like to see Joe? It’s their dream to see Joe. How about Iran, you think around might like to see Joe Biden? They’d go back, they say give me another $150 billion. We gave them 150 billion. We gave them one point eight billion in cash. You know what that looks like, one point eight billion in cash?(28:01)
And I’ll tell you what, if and when we win, we will get a call within about nine seconds after the victory and it’ll be Iran, it’s going to want to make a deal. We want them to make a deal. We want them to be good. We want them to be strong. They just can’t have a nuclear weapon. That’s all, it’s very simple. You can’t have a nuclear weapon. But I told people, I said, “Don’t talk to them now, look, they want to wait.” This is the gift. If they could do that, if China could do it, I mean, think of it. If Russia could do it, by the way, nobody’s been tougher on Russia than me with the sanctions. With the … I exposed, right, Nord Stream 2, that’s the pipeline. No, you never heard of Nord Stream until I came along.(28:45)
I said to Germany, let me get this straight. We defend Germany, right? We defend Germany and that’s it. They don’t pay what they’re supposed to pay, they’re delinquent, they’re delinquent. So I said to Angela and I like Angela, but I said, but she’s smart, why should she pay if she doesn’t have to. So I said, “Angela, so we defend you against Russia and you pay billions of dollars to Russia. How does that work? Explain to me what’s that all about?” But you never heard about that stuff. We’d give tank busters to Ukraine. We sell them in theory, I don’t know if we’ll ever get the money. We sell them. But he gave pillows, maybe he got them from Mike Lindell, the pillow man. You think when Obama sent pillows over to Ukraine, I send tank busters, they sent pillows. And the fake news goes, oh. Let me tell you, we have been very rough but at the same time we get along. I like Putin, he likes me. We get along. Wouldn’t you say it’s smart to get along, okay, it’s smart.(29:51)
I get along or I got along with President Xi, but I don’t know, after what happened here I’m having a hard time with China, I really am. They’re buying a lot, the trade deal has been incredible. They have been living up to it in all fairness. The largest order of corn in the history of our country, largest order of soybeans, largest cattle order. But it means less now, you understand. If we wouldn’t have been hit with this pandemic, which they could’ve stopped, it would have meant a lot. But it just means a lot less to me right now. So now after selling you out and bleeding you dry, Biden is back asking for your vote. The guy, when he was in prime time, which for him was about halftime. Long time ago, I had a friend, a senator, a Democrat, believe it or not. I used to get along with Democrats very well, actually better than the Republicans, but I won’t say that.(30:45)
But I asked him, “Who’s your smartest senator?” And he gave me a name. This is 25 years ago. I said, “Who’s your dumbest Senator?” “Joe.” “Who’s Joe?” “Joe Biden.” Oh, I see, he is, really?” “Yeah, he’s the dumbest senator.” Well, now he’s a lot dumber than it used to be, I can tell you. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true. And you can take the gloves up because they do all this disinformation, they make up phony stuff. Like the military with what he said, I think it’s a disgrace and he should apologize. A source said. I have 27 people that said, no way, it didn’t happen. They said … and the names are out there. So when they do that, you take the gloves off, that’s all. Really dishonest people, dishonest people. No, it’s a disgrace.(31:40)
And nobody’s done for the military what I’ve done. We’ve totally rebuilt our military. We’ve made it stronger than ever. We have the greatest weapons in the world. We’ve gotten raises for our great warriors. Our vet just got a 91% approval rating, the highest in the history of the V.A., our vets. They gave it a 91, the V.A., gave it a 91% approval rating. Nobody’s done more, nobody. And we do. We have weapons, the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. Hope to God we don’t have to use them but nobody has them. Not China, not Russia, nobody has the weaponry that we have. We have the greatest weapons in the world and hopefully don’t have to use them. Just remember that, we have the … I call it the super-duper missiles, like at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. You don’t see them either. They go through here, they say, “Boy, what happened? What was that? It’s gone. It’s here. There it is. I hear a noise over there. Where is it? It’s gone but it’s over there.”(32:43)
But it’s a hydrosonic. I call it super-duper, because super-duper is easier for people to understand then hydrosonic. But we have the greatest … two point five trillion dollars we spent. The greatest weapons in the world. The greatest weapons that this world has ever seen without a question, I don’t have to say what they are. In fact, the fake news said, “He just gave away classified information.” I said, “No, I just said we have the greatest weapons. I didn’t tell you what they are.” I could, because as president I’m allowed to do it. I mean, Hillary Clinton is the one that gives her white classified information. (33:40)
Yeah, Hillary. And how about the idiot John Bolton? I mean, he comes in and all he wants to do is go to war with everybody. If I listened to that idiot, we’d be right now in World War Five. “Sir, we saw some movement in China. I think we should go to war with them. And I think Russia, let’s do them both at the same time. Let’s also go in right now to North Korea.” Hey, do you remember North Korea? We were supposed to be at war with North Korea. What happened? What happened? You know what the press said? They said, it’s amazing. First they said it was amazing and those people lost their job, probably. It’s amazing what I’ve done, they said. No, we’re supposed to be at war. They have a lot of nuclear stuff, it wouldn’t be easy. We’d win, we’re going to win.(34:29)
Although, I tell you what I took over our military was totally depleted. We had a depleted mil-, we had old planes, we had old everything. It was a depleted military. And now it’s a beautiful brand new … we have F-35s that you can’t see. Stealth, they’re stealth. We have all new rockets, all new missiles, brand new planes, the bombers, the tankers, the jet fighters. What we’ve done is incredible. And we had to do it, somebody had to do it. Somebody said, well, we’re sort of doing some damage to our budget. I said, “Look, I want to have a strong military.” If I see some people, some soldiers from foreign lands, right, walking up or running up the White House lawn, the beautiful south lawn of the White House. I’m not going to be saying, “We didn’t do too well with the military, but we kept it under control in the budget, right?” No, the military supersedes everything.(35:24)
I don’t know, to me, I’ve always heard the Supreme Court. But to me, the most important thing has always been the military, our defense and our offense if needed. You know, it’s always [inaudible 00:35:36]. Joe Biden should not be asking for your support. He should be begging for your forgiveness and he should be. Biden supported the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership. This building wouldn’t be here if you ever did that one. Which would have been a death sentence for the U.S. auto industry and other industries. He supported the horrendous Korea deal, okay. How about the South Korea deal? It’s a disaster. So that was a Hillary Clinton deal, I must say, not him. Although I guess he had … he was vice, Hey, you know what’s interesting with Biden? So he always says, “Why didn’t the president do this. And why didn’t the president do that? And why didn’t do this and that, and this and that.”(36:16)
That’s been there for 47 years, but he just left like three and a half years ago. You know what I mean, he was there. And I keep saying, “Why didn’t you do it? Why didn’t you do it?” Could’ve done it. It’s not like he was 25 years ago. They were there three and a half years ago. Why didn’t you do it sleepy Joe? But the Korea deal and I say it all the time. She said, “This will create 250,000 jobs.” And everybody got all excited, oh, those jobs. The problem was the jobs were all produced in South Korea, so that didn’t work out to well. 250,000 jobs for South Korea. Anyway, I renegotiated the deal in its entirety, now it’s a good deal. That was a rip, I’ll tell you.(37:03)
And the pro-China Paris Climate Accord, it’s pro-everything, it’s pro-everybody but us. That would have cost us trillions of dollars, and we would have had the privilege of closing down Dayton’s … probably 25% of your companies. You could have never, you could have never done it. It’s an anti-America deal. And you know when I did it, I thought I’d be scorned. People understood that it was a total rip off. They understood it. With every decision, Joe Biden twisted a knife into the hands and heart of the American worker. But these brutal betrayals ended the day I took the oath of office, that’s true. I mean, I saw so much stupidity, the endless wars and we’re almost out of Afghanistan as you know. Not easy to get out because we have people in this country, the military industrial complex. Eisenhower called it the military industrial complex, and it does exist. It’s not easy-(38:03)
[inaudible 00:38:00] industrial complex and it does exist. It’s not easy to get out, but we’re very close to getting out and getting out of the Middle East. We’re down to very little in Iraq. We’re down to almost nothing in Syria, but I will be honest with you, we kept the oil. Somebody said, “You still have some soldiers in Syria?” I said, “That’s why they kept the oil.” We kept the oil. We should have done that in Iraq. Remember I used to say a long time ago before I was, “Don’t go into the Middle East, but if you’re going to go in and keep the oil.”(38:33)
Well, we went in and we didn’t keep anything and all the death, the blood in the sand, I call it the blood in the sand, that worthless sand. All of that death that has been caused for no reason. It was the worst decision in the history of our country going into the Middle East. We’re in there now $8 trillion, we’re almost out. $8 trillion and nothing but death and millions of lives if you look at both sides, I’ll look at both sides. Somebody would say, “Oh, I shouldn’t be looking at the other side. I look at both sides/ a lot of innocent people were killed. We lost incredible soldiers. I see the coffins, the caskets come in in Dover and I see it. And I said, “Oh boy, Why, why, why, why. Why did they do this?”(39:17)
My first week, I withdrew from the transpacific partnership and saved that whole business of so much and what I had to do is I extended for a short time and then totally ended NAFTA. You know NAFTA’s the worst trade deal ever made? Ever made. And we did the USMCA, Mexico, Canada. We have a great deal. And the reason I know it’s a great deal because the other sides are unhappy. You always liked to have an unhappy person at the other sides. No, they’re okay. But they had a free rip at us for years and years and years, NAFTA.(39:55)
How many buildings, how many factories did you lose right here? Where they moved over to Mexico, moved up to Canada, moved all over the place, but that’s not going to happen anymore. The new deal makes it very prohibitive to do that. In 2017, I signed a historic executive order making it really something. You got to do a couple of little expressions it’s called buy American and hire American. You know life is crazy in politics. Biden runs for president like two or three times, right? And I used to call him 1% Joe. And that was primetime for him, right?(40:39)
Now that primetime is long over, he ends up winning the nomination. Explain that? But had if Elizabeth Warren left and been loyal to her communist ideology, dare say socialist, but it’s communist. It was pretty close. Maybe somewhere in-between heading toward the C-word. But had she left before Super Tuesday, Biden would’ve lost every state, but she took the votes away from Bernie. And Bernie is a nice guy, you know Crazy Bernie. He is the nicest loser I’ve ever seen. When they talk about sportsmanship, he got screwed by Hillary Clinton badly, but not as badly as this time, this was worse.(41:17)
Because all Pocahontas had to do is leave a day early. She didn’t even have to endorse him. And the votes that she got, which weren’t many, but far more than he needed, because he lost a couple of states by literally a small amount of votes. He would’ve gotten most of those votes. He would’ve won. He would have been the one we fought. I don’t know/ who would have been better? Who would have been easier Sleepy Joe Biden or Crazy Bernie? Tell me.(41:43)
Sleepy Joe, who says Sleepy Joe? Who says Bernie? I don’t know. It’s hard. Bernie had more spirit. Joe’s got no spirit, it’s dead as a rock. The only spirit he’s got is spirit to beat me. And that’s called the negative spirit. And historically that doesn’t do that well. If you look at old races when somebody’s getting votes because they don’t like somebody, you know there’s an ideology that let’s face it doesn’t like me too much. Somebody said, “We don’t like his personality.” I said, “I always thought I had a good personality.” They don’t like my personality. Who the hell cares about my personality, right? Right?(42:17)
Got to get the job done. See those rough guys over there? I don’t like their personality either, but they get the job done. Right? Who the hell cares? Who cares about their personality? But when Sleepy Joe was vice president and other countries flooded our market… Thank you very much. Who is that? Wow. Good voice. Have you ever tried opera? Good voice. Thank you, darling.(42:50)
But other countries flooded our market with subsidized washing machines. You remember that disaster? Does anybody know about the Whirlpool plant in Clyde, Ohio? Right? And the head of Whirlpool came to see me. I was president-elect and he called and I don’t know, for some reason I’ve heard of Whirlpool and I’ve heard of it all my life, I guess. I didn’t know much about it. They made washing machines and I never knew, I knew they were dumping steel on us and dumping certain things. But I didn’t know they were dumping washing machines.(43:19)
And he was a good guy, came up to my office and he said, “They’re putting us out of business, South Korea, China, they’re dumping washing machines.” They make washing machines. They dump them into our market. They put everybody out of business. Then they charge you a lot of money when everyone’s gone. Just like Rockefeller used to do, right? Just like other people do right now, unfortunately, but we’re trying to track them down. And I said, “That’s really terrible.” I don’t know. Somehow it hit me. So we put a 50% tariff on all washing machines coming into our country. And I visited with Jim Jordan. You know Jim Jordan?(43:54)
You know he’s a great wrestler. One of the best. He was a great, great wrestler. Really a phenomenal wrestler, a real champion, NCAA champion and old Jim. And that’s the way he is. He’s a tough guy. No games, right? No games. That he works with our guys here, your guys. And he was great, but it’s Jim’s area. And we went up and saw the plant and then making thousands a day. I mean, they gave me a number, it can’t be positive. I think they said like 20,000 a day. I said, “How the hell can you make that many washing machines?” But you know what I’m talking about Congressmen, right?(44:45)
They’re making thousands of washing machines a day and it’s a vibrant company again, it was dead, it was going to close. But I evened up the score, I put the tariffs and now what they’re doing is LG and Samsung, and these companies that made the washing machine they’re now coming into the United States. And in order to avoid the tariff, they’re building plants in the United States and that’s okay and that’s what we should be doing.(45:13)
We’re going to be doing it a lot more too. We’re going to be doing it a lot more. Biden allowed other countries to target our steel industries and it was like a disaster for our steel industry, but we took historic action to end these practices and place strong tariffs on foreign aluminum and steel. And it brought back our steel. Now steel plants are opening or being upgraded in Toledo, Marion, Cuyahoga Heights, Mingo Junction, and all across the Midwest. They were gonzo.(45:49)
And you know certain industries you need. Some industries you don’t, but steel you need. Steel you need. For defense, you need it. You don’t want to talk war. You don’t want to talk about that, but if we had a problem,” what are you going to do? “Well, we don’t have any steel mills.” Let’s see if we can get some steel from China. “But sir, you’re fighting them. Well, that’s not working out too well.” No, we had to save our steel. We had to save our aluminum industry and we’ve done it. We’ve done a great job, but you have a lot of steel mills going up right here in Ohio.(46:19)
And a lot of them being expanded. And they’re really state-of-the-art. As vice president, Biden did nothing as China stole our intellectual property, flooded our markets with dumped goods. Unfairly subsidized these industries. Manipulated its currency. They’re the greatest in the world at that. I go to my guys, they said, “What about doing a little movement on the dollar?” “Sir, we can’t do that. It has to float naturally.” Well, China does it. China, you talk about a manipulation. Man, it’s like a yo-yo. Let’s see, let’s raise it. Let’s lower it, lets do this and that.(46:54)
But we actually called them on it, didn’t we Congressman? Turner, by the way, you did such a good job. You are a hell of a lawyer. You could represent me any day. Actually he did. He actually did represent me. Right? Davidson Turner, what a group. They’re tough. And then you had Jordan into it. They liked him though, don’t they huh? They like Jim. And they poisoned our communities with fentanyl. You know that? Instead, Biden allowed China to ravage our towns, raid our factories and rip apart our communities. That’s what they did. And then he goes in and he brings his son. “Hey, see if you can give him some money. Give him a billion and a half dollars.”(47:37)
I went to Steve Schwarzman. Steve Schwarzman is like one of the biggest guys on Wall Street, Blackstone. I said, “Steve, what are the chances.” He does a lot of business with China said, “Steve, what are the chances of somebody walking into an office in China and in 10 minutes, walking out with 1.5 billion to manage?” He said, Zero.” He said, “I couldn’t do it and I have this great company.” It’s a disgrace. How about where he points? Then he says, “You’re not getting your billion dollars unless you get rid of that damn prosecutor.” And then they says, “They got rid of the prosecutor. Here’s your billion dollars.”(48:16)
Does anything happen? Nothing happens. I’m so angry at Republicans. I am. I’m so angry. I am so angry, but a lot of things are happening. You’re seeing, you’re reading the papers also. A lot of things are happening. You know they spied on my campaign and we caught them. And by the way, that’s Biden, that’s Obama. They spied on my campaign. It’s never happened before. It’s treason. Comey and all the sleazebags, they spied on my campaign and we caught them. Let’s now see what happened. I stay out of it. I just say, I’m trying like hell to stay out of it.(49:03)
I don’t have to actually, but it’s better if I do. I think. Barry is shaking his head sort of like that’s the weakest yes, but it’s true. Right? But it’s true, I’m trying to stay out of it. But it’s a disgrace that it’s taken this long. I tell you what, these people are bad people. They’ve done things. What they’ve done to General Flynn and to other people is a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. And many others, but Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. It’s very simple.(49:39)
And I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China and their decades of pillaging, plundering, looting, including these massive tariffs. Don’t forget, I charged tariffs. Took in tens of billions of dollars. They targeted our great farmers. Do we have any farmers here? Any farmers? Well, am I correct? We gave the farmers $28 billion. Thank you very much, China. Right? Because they were targeted for 28 over a two-year period, 12 and 16. Right? Did you get your check? And you might not be in business if I didn’t do that.(50:17)
Good? Good. Thank you, darling. She gave me the right answer. It’s always dangerous to do that. No, I never got the money. No. She got the money. Yeah? But once again, Joe Biden has sided with China over America. Look, you think this guy’s going to be tough in China? His son? No, no. Think of it. And then he takes ads. “He’s going to be tough on China.” This guy, they looted him and Obama. And in all fairness, not just the eight years, this has gone on for 25, 30 years. Probably the biggest reason I decided to run and give up one of the greatest lives anyone’s ever had for this, for this.(50:55)
But you know why I like it? Because we have done more in the first three and a half years than any administration in the history of the country. And I say that and these fake news people don’t even question it. There’s nobody done what we’ve done. Between our military, between our trade, between our energy independence. All of the things, we could go on forever. But Biden vowed to remove those tariffs. He wants to remove the tariffs. You know when I made the deal with China, I said I have to leave the tariffs on. They said, “You got to be kidding.” They wanted one thing, the removal of the tariffs, and I wouldn’t do it. We wouldn’t do it. I said no.(51:34)
But Biden said the other day, he wants to take the… He doesn’t know what a tariff is first of all. “Sleepy Joe would like to remove the tariffs off China. They’re paying billions of dollars a year. Could we take them off?” “Absolutely. What are they exactly?” But it wouldn’t even happen that way. The radical left, which likes China, the radical left would walk into his office. And here’s your bill, right? It was supposed to be a speech. I haven’t exactly used it too much today. And they’ll say, “Here President, sign this.” Oh, okay. Do you have a pen? Okay. What was that?” “That’s the deal with China. Don’t worry about it.” That’s what would happen.(52:12)
But he gave China free rein to continue ransacking the American Heartland. And you know, look, they were targeting you. The reason nobody took on China was China said, “We’re going to go after your heartland.” And they said that to the presidents. And I said, “Go ahead, do it.” And the farmers were the most loyal. They all said, “We’ve got to do it sometime.” They told me that. I mean, they told me that loud and clear. We didn’t lose anything with the farmers. They said, “Somebody’s got to do it.” And I said, “Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to let them target you. They’re going to stop buying. We’re going to charge them tariffs and going to give you back the money that you lost, that you were targeted for. And we’re going to have tens of billions leftover for the treasury.” That’s exactly what happened. Nobody else ever told him that.(53:00)
Joe Biden is weak. He’s too scared to stand up to the radical left of his own party. And he’s terrified of standing up to China, but I believe he’s much more scared of the radical left than he is of China. That’s why China is desperate. You see the reports and news reports. They want Biden to win. They want Biden to win. They want him to win at any cost. If Biden is elected, China will own America. And if Biden is elected, you will have a depression the likes of which this country has never seen before. It’s very simple. It’s very simple. (53:54)
Largest tax increase ever proposed. That’s what they’re going to have. Does anybody mind paying more tax? All my life I’ve studied. I like politics. I just always liked it. It’s lucky I liked it because I never did it before. They said, “He can’t run. He’s got no experience.” And now that I look around yesterday, I was in the Oval Office, I said, “Oh, excuse me. Is this the Oval Office?” No, but a lot of it’s common sense. It’s all common sense. That’s why we call it protest. We’re studying some of the things. I’ll tell you one quick story. So we’re building an aircraft carrier long before my term, the Gerald Ford. And they decide on the catapults. You know the catapult? That throws the plane into the air. For years, it’s been 50 years, whatever longer, it’s been steam, simple, beautiful steam … throws her off …(54:43)
You ever see those airplanes? They go off. They catapult. So I noticed that this ship is never getting done. I came in and they said, “Oh, it’s got tremendous cost overruns.” I said, “What’s the problem?” Well, the catapult system doesn’t work.” “That’s strange because they’ve been building them for years. I wonder why.” You know about this. And I said, “Strange, let me check.” So anyway, I’m supposed to go over and take a tour. I went to take a tour of the ship, find out why it’s so late. I won’t tell you how many billions of dollars it’s over budget. Billions and billions of dollars. But I heard the catapult system and the elevators are no good. Other than that, it’s wonderful. Right?(55:21)
The elevators that bring the planes up, they don’t work. So if you have a problem, you can get your plans up. They’re down stuck in a garage, down at the bottom. Not too good. So I go over and they want me to meet the admiral, but I said, “No, no, no. I don’t want to meet the admiral yet.” I meet with the admirals a lot. I got a lot of admirals. I like the admirals. “I want to meet with the catapultors.” “Sir, why would you want to meet with the catapultors for?” “I want to find out why the hell the catapults don’t work.”(55:47)
So I went there and you know they did a new system. It’s electric, it’s all electric. So instead of steam, which is simple and great and powerful and good. And they know how it works for years and years, they decided to go all electric. Now if you take a little glass of water, take this glass of water, you throw it and that’s the end of that. You bring somebody in from MIT, how the hell do you fix it? And we’re dealing with the ocean and rockets being shot at the ship and the rough stuff. Right? But it wasn’t working. So I said, “No, I want to meet with a catapultor.”(56:21)
So there were five people that came in. One’s been doing it for over 20 years I think he said. I said, “Who’s the boss?” “I am, sir.” I said, “What do you think of our new system of electric catapults?” “Sir, it’s no good, sir.” I said, “That’s not good.” That’s actually it is what I expected it to be on. I said, “So, it’s no good. Right? The system is no good?” “No, sir.” I said, “What do you think of steam?” “Sir, it’s the greatest. That if it breaks down, I can fix it with a blowtorch or this hammer, I can fix it. And if the waves hit it, sir, all it does is cool it down a little bit, sir. It’s actually good for it, good for the surrounding steel.” I said, “So you think it’s better?”(57:03)
Surrounding steel. I said, “So you think it’s better?” I said, “Why did they do the electric?” Because they are totally inexperienced. Then I wanted to see the architect and I saw a representative, the architect of ship. Now this is a ship that costs $15 billion. And I looked at the architect. I said, “Have you designed a ship before?” And he said, “Yeah, I have.” I said, “You know, they have a $900 million cost overrun for electric catapults, and they’re no good even if they were.” I said to the guy, “Why is it that they did away?” “Sir, we could do it much faster. The thing goes back and forth.” I said, “All right, well, that makes sense.” But the catapulter said, “But sir, it doesn’t matter because it takes one minute and 52 seconds, if you’re Mario Andretti’s team, to get a plane hooked in. So the steam generates during that minute and a half and it’s all set to go. It doesn’t help that it keeps going back and forth.”(58:03)
I said, “That makes sense. That makes sense.” So it’s $900 million in cost overruns and here’s the story. They spent much more money and it’s no good. Then they have the elevators. Now, tractors use hydraulic, right? You know, they could do anything. Lift up. They go. It can rain. It can snow. Lightning hits the damn thing and nothing happens. The lightning gets hurt. Nothing happens. So they have these big elevators that lift the planes up. You know, the sirens go off. Everything’s beautiful. The problem is the elevators don’t work. So they’re magnetized. They’re lifted by magnets. I said, “Who the hell ever heard?” I know about that. You know, it’s a new technology that’s about 200 years off. So instead of using powerful hydraulic that never breaks, they have magnetized elevators. So stupid. I mean, honestly, so stupid.(58:55)
I tell you this because you’re workers and you guys understand this. It’s what we do is so stupid. So they have hundreds of millions of dollars in cost overrun for stuff that’s no good. And two years ago I told them it’s no good. You might as well rip it out because it’s never going to work. You put hydraulic in the elevators and you go back to steam and it’s such a shame to see the kind of money that was squandered by people that have no idea what the hell they’re doing. It’s a shame. Yeah. It’s a shame. And you would understand that. I’d only tell that story to really sort of a group like this because you guys understand it. It’s mechanical engineering at a very easy level. It’s easy to understand. Hundreds of millions of dollars wasted for something not as good.(59:44)
For decades. Our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign Wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities. We are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong.(01:00:11)
When the terrible plague arrived from China, we mobilized American industry like never before. We rapidly developed lifesaving therapies reducing the fatality rate by 85%. We’ve done such a good job, except in terms of public relations because the press just will not accept that. Think of what we’ve done with the ventilators. Soon, soon, the vaccines and the therapeutics, Remdesivir and other things. Europe is almost 30% greater excess mortality than the United States. They don’t want to say it. And now, as you know, you heard today, Europe had a tremendous outbreak. Okay. You know, they say, “Well, Europe, Europe, Europe.” No, we’re doing great. We’re doing great. Sadly, very sadly, I hate it, but they had a big outbreak that caused a stir in the market today. We launched the most ambitious vaccine program ever created. And we will deliver a vaccine before the end of the year, but it could be a lot sooner than that, a lot sooner.(01:01:14)
You know, it’s interesting. The Democrats, they’re all saying, “We want a vaccine.” That’s when they thought we couldn’t get it, right? Because if we relied on them, this vaccine would have taken two or three years more because of the FDA, and I’ve mobilized the FDA, and it’s incredible. But it would have taken two or three years more. So when they heard that we were getting the vaccine, they started knocking it. Think of it. So they put politics over life and death. I mean, it’s incredible. By the way, we’re rounding the corner in any event, but we’re going to have a vaccine very soon, is a great vaccine, great, great vaccine. It’s looking really good, really good. And it’s going to be a lot sooner than anyone thought. And it’s pretty sad when the Democrats try and make that into a political issue. Because they’re unhappy. It’s coming too soon. They didn’t think that would happen. We will end this pandemic in the next year. Will be one of the greatest years of the history of our country. That’s what’s happening. The third quarter will end just before November 3rd. You will see numbers, the likes of which no country has ever seen. That’s how well we’re doing. You’ll see. And if it’s before, so, they’re not good. I guess you’re going to have to remember that. And if they’re good, I hope you’re going to remember it too, but they’re going to be great. Somebody predicted 25% and then somebody said 35% GDP increase. Nobody’s ever heard of a number like that. But that’s the kind of thing we’re doing.(01:02:40)
Under my leadership, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world, and now we are doing it again. In the past four months, we’ve added a record smashing 10.6 million jobs, never been close to that. Four months, 10.6 million jobs. Manufacturing production is up 61%. auto production has surged 500%. And retail sales have soared 112%.(01:03:20)
But if sleepy Joe Biden wins, the economy will collapse. It’s going to collapse. Even psychologically it’ll collapse. And you know, as good as the stock market’s doing, it’s a headwind knowing you have an election. Things happen in elections, some bad things, some stupid things. But that’s a headwind. We’d be doing even better if this election were over. If we win and when we win the election, you’re going to see things roar because that’s what people want. That’s what the market wants. And that’s what the workers want. Biden keeps talking about a nationwide shutdown. There is no shutdown. My plan is to crush the virus. Biden plan and Biden’s really plan is to, and it’s not that he wants to crush America, but he will just out of gross incompetence. Biden will surrender to the virus, just like he surrendered to China.(01:04:10)
And just like he surrendered to the radical left, including his own running mate who’s running the show. And she’s nothing special. She is nothing. Between her and Elizabeth Warren, what a couple of great ones. What a couple of, what some people? Well, I’ll tell you something. Elizabeth Warren did do a great number on Bloomberg. Didn’t she? I tell you. One question and that was the end of him. How you enjoying politics, Mike? That didn’t work out too well. $1.8 billion wiped out in one question. That was the most expensive question in history.(01:04:46)
To protect our workers during the pandemic, I suspended the entry of new foreign workers who threatened American jobs. I know you don’t mind. You don’t mind that, do you folks? As the economy reopens, I want to ensure American workers that we’re putting America first and our jobs are put first. Our country is put first. Our manufacturing is put first. Everything is now put first for the USA.(01:05:15)
And by the way, we’re up to mile 330 on the wall. We’re setting records on not allowing all of these. I mean, some really bad. When you look at the traffickers. They traffic in women and drugs and other things, but they traffic in women, the drug dealers always. Setting records now on the wall because we have 330 miles. We’re averaging 10 miles a week and we’ll be finished with the wall very soon. And it’s had a huge impact.(01:06:06)
So one of the most radical things that will happen, and there’s no way he can get away with this because he was banning fracking for a year. He’s running, running, he’s banning fracking. I said, “He’s gone. He’s gone.” And then all of a sudden, now all of sudden he said, “Well, I didn’t really say that.” He did. Remember, it’s always the first thing they say with a politician. It’s the first thing. He wants to ban fracking and outlaw Ohio energy production.(01:06:33)
And you’re a big energy producer, whether you know it or not. So he’s going to ban fracking. There’s no question about it. And even if he didn’t want to, the whole radical left, their plan is to ban fracking. They want to ban fracking. They don’t want any fossil fuels. Just a few days ago, Biden reiterated his plan to require net zero carbon emissions. So you do that. I think it’s wonderful. Close up about 70% of your plants. This requirement would end all investment in fracking and it would just shut down everything. Our country, do you see the rolling blackouts they have in California? I don’t think we want too many of them in Ohio. Do we? Would anybody like a few rolling blackouts? Like we’d like to watch president Trump tonight. I’m sorry, darling, but we have no energy. We have no energy.(01:07:25)
We’re going to get it from the wind. The wind is blowing. The wind, the wind has got a wonderful, wonderful energy. The wind, when it’s blowing it’s just fine for about 20% of the time. By ending fracking, Biden would destroy 700,000 to a million Ohio jobs and your energy prices would go through the roof. When Biden was Vice President, they deliberately killed 40% of all coal mining jobs and the rest were coming fast. I saved it. I put our miners back to work, clean coal. I call it clean coal. Can do a lot with coal. And while I’m President, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world and Ohio workers will continue leading the way. And that’s what we’re doing. And just in concluding, over the next four years, we will build America into the manufacturing, super power of the world. And we will end our reliance on China and all other faraway lands that nobody in this beautiful facility, whatever the hell you make here, I don’t know, but it looks good to me. But nobody ever heard of it. You have lands that would go to that nobody ever even heard of. Where are you sending this money? We’re sending it to such and such a country. I never heard of it.(01:08:42)
We’ll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We’ll cut your taxes and taxes for middle class families at a level never seen before. You know, we gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. We gave you the biggest regulation cut in the history of our country. And we’re going to give you additional regulation cuts. That’s one of the reasons you had the jobs. You know, in many ways, the regulation cutting was perhaps as important or more important. You see the tax cutting easier, but the regulation cutting was every bit as important. And we’re going to expand opportunity zones to ensure that no community is left behind. And they’ve been a tremendous success, especially for the African American, Hispanic community. We’re doing incredible. Tim Scott, great Senator from South Carolina. We worked hard on it. Opportunities zones. It’s a big success.(01:09:43)
We’ll enforce immigration rules that defend American families, raise American wages, and always put the interests of American workers first. We will enact fair trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA, right? And we will always live by the timeless words of our national motto: In God We trust. And they took the word God out of the Pledge of Allegiance. You saw that. I was listening to this Pledge of Allegiance and I said, “That’s strange. They must’ve made a mistake. It must’ve been a typo. Something happened.” But then it happened twice. And then it was getting ready to happen a third time, and somebody heard that the public was enraged, including me by the way. And by the way, we want the NFL to stand and put their hand on their heart. Got to do it. Right?(01:11:10)
I thought we taught them that lesson about two years ago. The commissioner tried it again. It’s not working too well. Not working. The ratings are not good. People are angry about it. People love our country. You love our country. You love our flag. You love our anthem. This November, if you want jobs, if you want opportunity, if you want safety, and if you want a President who defends the dreams of workers in Dayton and Akron and all across Ohio in America, then you need to get out and vote for Trump, Mike Pence. How good is Mike Pence? Trump Pence. And I love Mike, but it’s not Pence Trump, okay? You understand? It’s not Pence. Mike will be the first one to say. You know, when he said that the other day. He said the Harris Biden administration. I said, “That’s strange.” And Mike called me up. He said, “You never have to do that.” I said, “Don’t worry, Mike. I won’t. I promise.” Mike Pence has done a great job. I’ll tell you. He’s a great guy.(01:12:13)
Together we will make America safer. We will make America stronger and prouder and greater than ever before. We’re going to make it greater than ever before. And again, this was not a rally. This was a group of people, workers, and this is what it was told to me as, and we had a lot of fun and we have a lot of fun, but it’s very serious business. November 3rd and before, depending on whether or not you have those fake ballots or whatever. Be careful with that. I mean, that thing is going to be one of the great catastrophes. What a mess. And they want it to be a mess. They know it’s no good. I think it’s 11 different races. When they have small races, they can’t account. People steal the ballots. People don’t get the ballots.(01:12:55)
They don’t send them to a Republican area or maybe a Democrat area, whatever, it’s still wrong. But it happens to be Republican, unfortunately. But they don’t send them out. Then they harvest them, which they’re not allowed to do. They have in Nevada, the Governor said he signed an order that they don’t have to sign. We need no signature verification. Oh, that’s great. Because they couldn’t get people to sign, so they said, “We’ll just send them in. Don’t worry about it.” This is a real affront to our democracy. This is a horrible thing that’s going on. And the Democrats know it and they say, “Well, he’s not for our great heritage. He is fighting our vote.” No I’m not fighting our vote. You have ballots that you go out and you can get, you could request as you know, you can request them and that’s fine.(01:13:48)
But if you’re not requesting them, when you get millions of ballots, 80 million they say all over the United States, where the hell are they going? Who’s sending them? Who is getting them? Who’s sending them back? What’s happening with the transportation? Who’s guarding the lockboxes? They know it’s a fraud waiting to happen. But you know, we’re not talking about 1%, which is no good, because you could lose or win an election by 1%, we’re talking about 20%, 30% in one case, over 40%. This is a disgrace that they’re allowed to get away with. And what they want to do is they want to have a mess at the end of the evening on November 3rd and then fight it out in the courts. And the Democrats should be ashamed of themselves because they know what they’re causing. We love Ohio. We love Dayton. God bless you. God bless Ohio. And God bless America. Thank you. Thank you, everybody."

Thank you everybody, please. Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to be here and thank you, Dan. I’m thrilled to be in the great state of Ohio. You are very good to me, but I’ve been very good to you. I’ve been very good to you. We’ve been good to each other. With the incredible men and women of Whirlpool, the largest washing machine factory anywhere in the world. Every day, 20,000 gleaming new machines rolling off that beautiful assembly line. I just got to see it. And every single one is proudly inscribed with that glorious phrase, made in the USA. Remember? Made in the USA.(00:44)
When I was campaigning, I said, “Let’s go. Made in the USA, put it on your machines, put it on everything we make.” I’m grateful to everyone at Whirlpool for welcoming us today, including Marc Bitzer, thank you. Jim Kepler and Sarah. Both of them. Thank you very much. Sarah, where’s Sarah? Thank you. Thank you very much. Sarah [Bovard 00:01:04].(01:06)
Also, with us today is secretary of labor, Eugene Scalia, and a warrior. I’m sure you never heard of him. He’s a warrior. A great, great wrestling champion and a great guy. Jim Jordan. Jim, he is a warrior. Thanks Jim. And he’s tough. I’m not going to wrestle him ever. I promise.(01:32)
And another warrior, great fellow who has been right at our side. He works with Jim and I so much and so hard. Bob Latta. Bob, thank you very much. Thank you Bob. Also Lieutenant Governor, Jon Husted, thank you, Jon. Thank you.(01:55)
State senate president, Larry [Orpaff 00:01:58]. Larry, thank you very much. Thank you, Larry. Thank you. Clyde Mayor, Scott Black, and many other distinguished guests, great people. Great representatives. Thank you fellas. Thank you very much.(02:16)
As we celebrate Whirlpool’s 109 year legacy of American manufacturing excellence, today I want to lay out my vision to bring millions and millions, more jobs and thousands more factories back to American shores where they belong. We’ve been doing it long and hard.(02:36)
One of the reasons you’re successful today happens to be a meeting I had probably four years ago with a very good representative of your company saying what they were doing to you and how badly you were being treated by other countries. And you know what I did. And here we are today, the most successful plant.(02:58)
And we’ve done this in a lot of places. The duty of a president is to put this nation’s own citizens first. That’s why my administration swears by two simple, but crucial rules, buy American and hire American(03:17)
And no one knows better than the workers of Whirlpool, the high cost of past administrations’ economic blunders and surrender. On the question of foreign trade, previous leaders were guided by a shameful policy of capitulation, submission and retreat.(03:36)
For decades, you watched as politicians let foreign nations steal our jobs, loot our factories, and plunder the crown jewels of the US economy. And the word plunder is capitalized. Washington stood idly by as other countries engaged in unfair trade practices such as massive subsidies, currency manipulation, and in the case of your industry and your company, the wholesale dumping of foreign made product sold below cost for the sole purpose of driving you out of business so they could give us product at double, triple, and quadruple the price. But we didn’t let that happen, did we?(04:25)
For eight years, Whirlpool begged the Obama-Biden administration who did nothing to protect American workers from the flagrant dumping of foreign washers, dryers into America. But your cries for help fell on deaf ears. You didn’t see any action. They didn’t act, they didn’t care, and they never will.(04:48)
For eight long years under Obama-Biden administration, American factory workers received nothing but broken promises and brazen sellouts and lost jobs. The last administration tied America up in one globalist debacle after another, they catered to the special interests while allowing foreign nations to siphon off our wealth, our dignity, our dreams, our money. The suffering of our workers was met with nothing but cruel betrayal and callous indifference.(05:26)
In 2013, the US International Trade Commission found your competitors from Korea and other countries guilty of dumping washers into the US market and ordered them to pay anti-dumping duties as high as 79%. But rather than pay these very high tariffs, LG and Samsung relocated production to another country, a country called China. Have you ever heard of it? And the last administration did nothing as they kept on dumping washers into the US market with impunity.(06:04)
The Obama-Biden administration was laughed at. They were a joke, and they were perfectly happy to let China win, your jobs disappear and your factory to close. And you know what it was like, I came through today and everybody was out there, tremendous crowds waving and cheering. I said, “I must’ve done it right.” Because you had people that were really, really something.(06:34)
Because four or five years ago, this place was a disaster. In 2017, Whirlpool one relief from the ITC once again, once more, your foreign competitors moved their factories to prevent a level playing field and to avoid liability, shifting production to Thailand and to Vietnam, to places that I like their leaders very much. They’re very nice to us. Do they take advantage of the United States, but not so much anymore.(07:09)
But this time there was one big difference. Instead of an administration that sold out American workers and sold your company out, and couldn’t have cared less for you, you finally had a president who stood up for the American worker on January 23rd, 2018 at my desk in the oval office, I proudly signed the order to impose a 50% tariff on all foreign-made washing machines.(07:42)
As a result, Whirlpool’s nine factories across the United States were soon thriving like never before. Investing in new products, new infrastructure and hundreds of new American jobs, and I just took a tour, and I actually wanted a couple of those machines for myself, but I just didn’t know it was going to be appropriate to ask. But they are beautiful. That includes thousands of new jobs across the Ohio supply chain from right here in Clyde to Findlay, Ottawa, Greenville and Marian. All of them.(08:25)
Your company became a shining example from really a company that was down and out, it became a shining example of what tough trade policies and smart tariffs can bring to jobs and prosperity to communities like this one all over Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and plenty of other states. They’re all doing well. They were doing great, then the plague came in, and now they’re doing great again.(08:52)
We closed it up, we saved millions of lives, but now we’re opening and it looks like I was right about the V, because you’re seeing the kind of numbers that are coming in, and they’re coming in strong. Should have never happened. Should have never happened. China should have never let it happen.(09:11)
In defending your jobs here at Whirlpool, I was doing exactly what I promised in June, 2016. As a candidate for president, I stood before an audience of hardworking patriots at a metals processing facility outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to outline my plan for a new America first trade policy. And it was even a better job than I told you. I’m one politician that says I’m going to do this, and then we do better. We produced more than I promised. And by the way, the wall is being built, it’s going to be finished very soon.(09:51)
In my speech, I warned that our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization, moving our jobs, our wealth, and our factories overseas. I explained that globalization… These are the globalists. I’m not liking globalists too much, but they don’t like me too much either.(10:11)
Globalization has made the financial elites who donate to politicians very wealthy, but it’s left millions and millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and headache, and our towns and cities with empty factories and plants. Four years later, we’ve made extraordinary progress in reversing the dangerous tide of globalism. Over a period of four to five years, this took place. Think of it. Four to five years. What we’ve done is a miracle, and now it’s getting even better because we’ve taken additional steps. And you know when you do these steps, you have to go through statutory procedures. It’s not like, boom! I’m going to just sign it.(10:58)
It has to go out for 90 days of review, then 120 days of review, then more, and we did it as quick as we can. We’re doing it right now with the FDA. We’re getting vaccines approved in days that nobody thought possible. It would take years and years and we’re doing it in months. We’re doing very well.(11:16)
Under my administration, we’re fighting for main street, not Wall Street. We’ve rejected globalism and embraced patriotism. In my speech in Pittsburgh, in June of 2016, I made seven big promises to American workers. Many politicians before me promised change on the campaign trail, only to back down in the face of corporate and international pressure.(11:43)
Like Jerusalem, they all promised Jerusalem, didn’t they? For years and years. I did it. They didn’t do it. They didn’t do it. I did it. Move the embassy to Jerusalem, making Jerusalem the capital of Israel. They all talked about it. They talked and talked, and talked, and then they got into office and they didn’t do it.(12:06)
And I understand why, the pressure was enormous on me too. I just didn’t take the phone calls. That’s true. Leaders would call up from other countries. I said, “Know what they’re calling about. I’ll call them back in a few days.” Then I just signed all the papers. Got it done. And then I called them back.(12:26)
They said, “I was calling about Israel and Jerusalem, but you’ve already done it.” I said, “That’s right.” And they said, “Oh, okay.” I said, “Hey, I wish you got me a little bit earlier.” But I didn’t back down from my promises. And I’ve kept every single one.(12:44)
First I promised to withdraw the United States from the last administration’s disastrous assault on US workers. The Trans-Pacific partnership would have been a disaster. Would’ve been a disaster, especially for the automobile industry. We would have put it out of business. By first week in office, I kept that promise and canceled that job killing catastrophe.(13:09)
Second, I pledged to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to defend American jobs, and I did with Bob Lighthizer and all of his people, they’ve been fantastic.(13:20)
Third, I said I would use every legal tool at my disposal to fight back against unfair trade, and I did, and I found some that nobody even knew about. Some of them were very old, they had a lot of dust on them. Hadn’t been used for decades and decades, but I found them. Things you could never get passed today.(13:41)
Fourth, I promised to label China a currency manipulator, and I did. Fifth, I said we would bring trade cases against China to crack down on its economic aggression. Sixth, I committed to impose tariffs on goods to protect American jobs and stop China, and many other countries’ abuses under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. As your president, I have kept every single one of these pledges to the American people, and to the American worker without exception. Every one has been done. Seventh, one of my biggest promises in that speech was to replace the disaster known as NAFTA. One of the worst trade deals ever made by any country, let alone ours. Ohio lost almost 40% of its manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed. Half of all of the auto making jobs across the state were wiped out. Earlier this year, I finally ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA agreement. That’s United States-(15:03)
..signed the brand new USMCA agreement. That’s United States and Mexico and Canada. And all of those bad things that you had to suffer with, you’re not suffering anymore, because now people and companies have an incentive to stay. They’re not going to be leaving so fast.(15:18)
That was the biggest point I made. I want to make sure that these companies aren’t leaving, and the managers walk up and they say, “I’m sorry, our company’s leaving, going to Mexico, or Canada.” But going primarily in that case to Mexico, Canada takes advantage of us with dairy, unbelievable advantage, but not anymore. But Mexico took a lot of jobs. And I said, “I don’t want companies moving. And if they do move, remember you’ve heard it. If they do move, when they make that product, they’ve got to pay a big price to sell it back into our country.” So they have no more incentive to move.(16:02)
The USMCA contains powerful new protections for American manufacturers, automakers, farmers, dairy producers, and workers, all across Ohio and all of our States. Those were key promises I made to American workers in 2016. I kept every single one of them. The fake news media back there, they hate to report this. Why do they hate it? Because they’re fake.(16:34)
Today to define our path forward, I’m making our incredible workers, six more promises that I will keep over the next four years. And I’m very proud to make them at your plant, and in the state of Ohio. First and foremost, we will defeat the China virus. We’re working very, very hard. We call it the China virus. We call it the invisible enemy. We call it many different names. It’s got many different names, but it’s bad. And we’ve made tremendous strides. We’re attacking the virus from every angle, and through this aggressive strategy, we will win the war and it will happen sooner than people think. We’re developing a bounty of therapies, such as Remdesivir, Dexamethasone, antibody treatments. The antibody treatments are really working out well, really well, and many more that have allowed us to reduce mortality by 85% since April. Under operation warp speed, two vaccines are already in the final stage of clinical trials and we’ll have a vaccine very soon, I hope long before the end of the year.(17:45)
We’ve dramatically increased our domestic production of personal protective equipment, such as N95, respirators, gowns and gloves. We’ve got factories now all over the United States making these products. And we’ve developed the most advanced testing system on earth to produce our most… And this is what we have to do. We have to produce not only cleanliness and perfection in every way, but we have to protect our most vulnerable citizens against this horrible virus. And that’s generally speaking the elderly, especially the elderly with problems of the heart, problems with the heart, and diabetes in particular, those two are a basic disaster. Our strategy shelters those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to get safely back to work and to school.(18:40)
Instead of a never ending blanket lockdown causing severe longterm public health consequences, we’ve targeted and looked at data driven approaches, and that’s what we’re doing again, when you close down, and we had to do it initially because it came and hit us big, hard, and nobody knew what it was and we saved millions of lives, but today you just pinpoint it. We know what to do, and we know who to protect. As an example, very young children are incredibly powerful. They’re much stronger than all of us when it comes to the immune system. It’s an incredible thing to see, but we know who to protect and we know what to do. And let me tell you, lockdowns have big consequences in terms of drugs, in terms of family, in terms of depression and suicide, in terms of so many other problems that are caused. And not good for the kids, and they don’t learn the same at a computer as they do when they’re in a classroom. So there are big, big problems with lockdowns.(19:47)
But we cannot defeat the virus by fighting against each other, just can’t. And there are a lot of different theories and a lot of different ways, but if you look at some of the results, you’ll see some of the states, governor run… some of the states that are open and run very smart are doing very well, and in fact, better than strong lockdown states. Now is the time to come together as Americans and to unite against the plague inflicted upon us by China. Together we will prevail.(20:22)
My second promise to you is this, we will arise from the current adversity of this horrible invisible enemy, and we will be more prosperous and resilient than ever before. We’ve done things that we never knew we could do. We’re building factories now. We’re building plants. You’ll see what’s going to be happening with the job numbers very soon. We had two of the best months ever in the history of our country. And we’re going to have many, many very, very successful years, unless somebody comes and destroys it by doubling, tripling, and quadrupling your taxes. And quadrupling something else called regulations. It will be ended. It will be depression time.(21:09)
One of the key lessons we’ve learned in this battle against the China virus is that the mighty American economy has a fantastic ability to adapt and repurpose its factories. Today using the Defense Production Act, which we’ve used often. Remember they’d always say, “Oh, use the Defense Production Act”. We’ve used it a lot, more than some companies would like to know. We’re engaged in the most rapid industrial mobilization by far since World War II.(21:39)
Over the last six months, we’ve witnessed one manufacturing miracle after another. We’ve seen General Motors repurpose an auto parts facility In Kokomo, Indiana. Great state. And thereby stand up a ventilator. We have a ventilator factory literally in a matter of days, and we’re now producing thousands and thousands of ventilators a week. General Motors has now built and delivered more than 20,000 ventilators. By next week, our strategic national stockpile will be equipped to deploy more than 100,000 ventilators. They’re very expensive to build. They’re very complex. Very, very complex machines and they’re big. And I said that we are now supplying ventilators to many countries of the world. Everybody in our country has it. Not one person… And we had no ventilators. Who knew about ventilators? We had very few. But not one person… Think of this, who needed a ventilator didn’t get it. Every person that needed a ventilator got it. Who would have thought that was possible? And you remember at the very beginning, when you first heard about this whole horrible situation with the China virus, ventilators, they weren’t around, and now we make them by the thousands.(23:03)
Working with GM and almost a dozen other companies, great companies, my administration has turned America into the ventilator king of the world. Ventilator king. Make them good, and we make them great. They’re very good, highest quality. We’re now exporting ventilators to friends and allies. And they’re really thankful they’re calling, “Can I have ventilators for our country, sir?” ” How many do you need?” “Could you send a thousand?” I said, “That’s a lot. The answer is yes.” What we’re doing is incredible. We’re helping other… We’re doing more goodwill with ventilators, because other things you can make, gowns and swabs and things you can make. We’re making them too, but ventilators are tough.(23:48)
Ventilators are just one part of our historic manufacturing ramp up. Within seven days of New York officials asking for assistance last spring, we helped ship a million yards of fabric from North Carolina to New York city for masks and gowns. We’re making them all over the place. A great company, Honeywell, has opened up and N95 respirator factories in Rhode Island and Arizona in record time. And they’re now churning out tens of millions of masks for our strategic national stockpile. These include manufacturing achievements, and these are incredible. They’ll be the foundation of an even brighter future for American industry. What we’ve been able to do in a short period of time is frankly incredible. I’m not talking about me. I’m talking about the people out there. What they’ve done is incredible. Including the military and some of the generals and admirals, the job they’ve done.(24:45)
My third promise is to build on these gains, to turn America into the premier medical manufacturer, pharmacy, and drug store of the world. As we’ve seen in this pandemic, the United States must produce essential equipment, supplies, and pharmaceuticals for ourselves. We cannot rely on China and other nations across the globe that could one day deny us products in a time of need. We can’t do it. We can’t do it. We have to be smart.(25:21)
And speaking of pharmaceuticals, we instituted four moves, rebates, favored nations, and other things. Buying from other nations where they have the product, the same exact pill, identical, made in the same factory, for just a small fraction of the cost. We buy from other countries, as opposed to buying through this ridiculous quagmire of political scam that we’ve been going through for many years. And what I’ve done in terms of favored nations if, as an example, Germany has a pill for 25 cents and we have a pill for $2, we institute favored nations of the drug company. We get the pill for the same amount as the lowest pill, anywhere in the world. Anywhere in the world. That could drop your price of pharmaceuticals, of drugs, prescription drugs. Could drop your price 50, 60, 70%. Maybe more than that. This is something.(26:29)
Now I have to tell you, I have never seen so many bad commercials about me as in the last three days since I did this. So when you remember that, when you see this horrible commercial, that I’m a socialist… I was called the socialist for the first time in my entire life. Actually, what I am doing is I’m using socialist countries who are buying our product for far less than we’re allowed to. I’m saying, “Well, if you’re going to sell it to this country, might be socialist, for a lower price, then we’re going to get that same price.” But I have been called everything in the book. And I say, I said the other day, “Whenever you see a drug company advertising that Donald Trump’s a bad guy, remember your drug prices must be coming down very big.” So please remember that.(27:21)
Please remember that because I don’t want to get all those negative votes and then Biden wins and the first month, he’ll say “I dropped drug prices 78%,” and he won’t even know what the hell he’s saying. I don’t want to be watching that from some beautiful resort someplace in the world… Oh, I had such a beautiful life before I did this, but that’s okay because we’re doing a great job. And it makes me very happy to see people being properly represented for a change.(27:54)
But during the course of the next four years, we will bring our pharmaceutical and medical supply chains home. We’re going to bring them home where they belong, and we’ll end reliance on China, just like we did with the washers and dryers, just like we did with many other things. We’ll be making our product here safely, beautifully and inexpensively. We’re reasserting American economic independence, and I’ve been doing that from the first day I came into office.(28:24)
To this end, a short time ago, I signed the new executive order to ensure that when it comes to essential medicines, we buy American. The executive order will require that US government agencies purchase all essential medicines that we need from American sources. The executive order will also sweep away unnecessary regulatory barriers to domestic pharmaceutical production, and support advanced manufacturing processes that will keep our drug prices low and allow American companies to compete on the world’s stage. We’ll be able to compete on the world stage, but we’re now going to have the lowest prices as opposed to by far the highest prices. I have people that I know that go to Canada. They go to Canada to buy drugs, to buy prescription drugs. They go there because the price is so much lower than the United States. And yet it’s made by the same company, often in the same plant. It’s a disgrace.(29:32)
And the politicians allowed this to happen for many, many decades. You have people called middlemen. I don’t know who the middlemen are. I don’t know. They never say middle women. So they’re politically not correct. But I’ve heard the term middlemen for a long time, they are so wealthy. They are so wealthy. Nobody has any idea who the hell they are, what they do. They make more money than the drug companies. In all fairness, at least a drug companies have to produce a product and it has to be a good product, but the middlemen. Well, the rebate.(30:03)
To be a good product, but the middlemen. Well the rebate that I’m doing cuts out the middleman and reduces costs and the money goes back to the people purchasing the drugs. So I have a lot of enemies out there. This may be the last time you’ll see me for a while. A lot of very, very rich enemies but they are not happy with what I’m doing but I figure we have one chance to do it and no other president’s going to do what I do. No other president would do a favored nations, a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost, nobody, and there are a lot of unhappy people and they’re very rich people and they’re very unhappy.(30:39)
Here’s my fourth promise to American workers. Beyond our medical supply chain, so over the next four years, we will launch our millions of new manufacturing jobs across many other critical sectors that are vital to our national security and prosperity, from electronics to machine tools to shipping, aerospace, autos, and of course to iron and to steel and we will never forget your washers and your dryers. During eight years of the last administration … And by the way I have to just tell you this little story. A couple of little stories if you don’t mind. Do you mind?1:19)
No.(31:19)
Because that’s better than the other stuff, right? No, I was with somebody and they said, “You know for a dishwasher, we don’t have enough water, sir.” I think a lot of the people in the audience would understand what I’m saying. They don’t have enough water because they put restrictors on, so you don’t have any water and I said, “What is that? What is that?” In most states, outside of desert areas we have so much water we don’t know what to do with it. A lot of states. Your state does pretty well with water. So they have plenty of water, so I passed a regulation, I signed a regulation that gave the dishwashers much more water and I was asking today, and that by the way includes your washers. You don’t need too much water in your dryers but it includes your washers and I was just saying to your brilliant people that are doing such a good job running your company, I said, “How much impact does that have?” They said, “Unbelievable. It’s been unbelievable.” Because I had people saying they’d wash their dishes and they’d press their button five times, so in the end they’re probably wasting more water than if they did it once.(32:22)
So you do notice, the people that make the machines, you know what I’m talking about. We now have the water that you need instead of stupid where you have much less water than you need and you just keep going over and over again. I had people say they’d press the button five times. They didn’t have enough water, and the same thing with sinks, toilets and showers. You go into a new home, you turn on the faucet, no water comes out. You turn on the shower, if you’re like me you can’t wash your beautiful hair properly. You waste 20 minutes longer, please come out, the water. It drips … You know what I’m talking about, they put restrictors on. I got rid of that, I signed it out. That’s common sense. So now when you actually go into a new home and pay a lot of money, you turn on a faucet and water actually comes out. Isn’t that nice? That was a regulation that was put in by a lot of people that don’t understand life. Because you end up using the same amount of water, you just let it run three times longer. It’s crazy.(33:24)
One other thing I did, remember the old light bulb? The old light bulb was so great and they put it out of business. It was much cheaper and it had much better light and you’re all good-looking people but you look better under the old light bulb than that horrible new light bulb. It cost you a fraction of the cost. Didn’t last as long but that’s okay, but it cost you a fraction. I re-instituted and opened it up so they can sell both, they can sell the new one if you want it and they can sell the old one. The old one’s doing amazing business, amazing business. You know the new one is considered hazardous waste. When you lose it, you’re supposed to take it down to a dump, a specified dump. How many people are going to do that with a light bulb? “Hey you know, we lost this light bulb. Let’s travel 28 miles outside of the city to get rid of it.” It’s hazardous waste. So I put the old bulb back in and you can use the new one, you can use anything I guess, it’s competition but I particularly like it because I don’t look so orange so it’s very nice. Very nice. I don’t want to look, I don’t like that look, never liked it, but it’s a tremendous thing and it’s having tremendous success. So they’ll scoff and say, “Oh, who cares about that?” Very big stuff. These are big things. A lot of people have come up, “Thank you sir. They had sinks that didn’t give water. They had showers that didn’t give water,” the whole thing and it’s been a great thing, it’s been very popular, and we might as well tell you about it because people don’t talk about it but these are things that no other president would be doing, no other president frankly would be even thinking about.(35:01)
During eight years of the last administration, America lost 10,000 factories and nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs. Think of that. In contrast my administration added over a half a million manufacturing jobs, it was up to actually 701,000 jobs before the plague came in and if you remember, President Obama, you need a magic wand. No you don’t, we need manufacturing jobs. He said you won’t have any more manufacturing jobs, you need a magic wand. He was wrong about that also. My fifth promise to American workers is to bring back American jobs and factories using every tool at my disposal including tariffs, I love properly put on tariffs because they bring unfair competitors from foreign countries to do whatever you want them to do. Countervailing duties and new trade deals based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity, and I’ll be signing something very important. Watch over the next week, I think you’ll be very proud of your president. I’m going to be signing something that’s very important over the next probably week and it will have a tremendous impact on fairness and trade.(36:15)
As part of this commitment earlier today, I signed a proclamation that defends American industry by reimposing aluminum tariffs on Canada. Canada was taking advantage of us as usual and I signed it and it imposes because the aluminum business was being decimated by Canada, very unfair to our jobs and our great aluminum workers. Several months ago my administration agreed to lift those tariffs in return for a promise from the Canadian government that its aluminum industry would not flood our country with exports and kill all our aluminum jobs which is exactly what they did. Canadian aluminum producers have broken that commitment and the U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer has advised me that this step to reimpose tariffs is absolutely necessary to defend our aluminum industry. To be a strong nation, America must be a manufacturing nation and not be led by a bunch of fools. That means protecting our national industrial base. We have to protect our great companies and our great workers. My sixth and final promise today is to forever uphold the commitment I made from the beginning. I will always put American workers first, always. They’ll always be first place.(37:38)
I don’t know if you’re union or non-union, doesn’t matter to me, but I did one hell of a good job for the unions. You know all the union heads are against me but all the workers are for me so something’s right. The workers are for me, they’re usually the union heads that wined and dined in Washington pretty good by the Democrats. As part of this commitment on Monday I signed an executive order to prevent government agencies like the Tennessee Valley Authority from replacing American workers with cheap foreign labor. There’s a very big utility run by a man that gets $8 million a year. Would anybody in this room like that job? $8 million? $8 million a year, right? Highest paid … He really doesn’t work for me, I wouldn’t pay $8 million. If you paid him … The president gets $400,000.00, $450,000.00. I give up my salary, nobody ever says that, I might as well every once in a while say it. I believe I’m the only president to do that and I’m saying that’s not too smart, but the Tennessee Valley Authority pays $8 million a year to the head and after the Authority laid off 20% of its American technology workforce and forced them to train their foreign replacements this week, I told the chairman of the board, “You’re fired.”(39:13)
The firings will continue unless the layoffs are reversed and the American workers are rehired and by the way as I was leaving for the great state of Ohio, did you ever watch Biden? Where he’s always saying the wrong state. It’s great to be in Florida, Florida. No it’s Ohio. I’ve never seen a guy, I haven’t done that one yet. That’s a disaster. I always say, Jim Jordan, if you do that, it’s over. You can be Winston Churchill, [inaudible 00:39:42] walk off the stage, but he does it all the time. Nobody calls him for it. “I love the state of Iowa.” “Sir, sir, it’s Idaho. It’s Idaho.” The worst is when he’s in like Indiana and he says it’s great to be with the people of Florida and you have palm trees all over the place. But he does it all the time. There’s something going on.(40:08)
Over the last four years, we’ve made extraordinary strides and over the next four years together we will turn the United States into the unrivaled manufacturing superpower of the world. We’ve been through a lot together. They’ve done everything possible to get in my way, they’ve treated us very unfairly, disgracefully, with what they’ve done to us and despite what they’ve done, no administration in the history of this country has done more in the first three and a half years than we have. Whether it’s rebuilding our military, all made in the USA, whether it’s the biggest tax cuts in history, whether it’s the biggest regulation cuts in history, ANWR in Alaska, the largest field perhaps in the world that Ronald Reagan going back even before Ronald Reagan, no president could get it approved, I got it approved and now it’s potentially one of the greatest sites in the world, should be the greatest site in the world.(41:10)
So many different things we’ve done, we’ve done so much. What we’ve done for our vets and you’re a big vet state, Ohio loves its vets and what we’ve done for our vets. Choice and accountability. We’ve got two things they’ve been trying for almost 50 years, choice, veterans’ choice. How about that? We got that for you, so if you have to wait in line for two days or two weeks or two months and they had to wait two months sometimes, if they had to wait in line, they don’t anymore. They go outside, they get a private doctor, we approve it, we pay the bill and we take care of our vets like they’re supposed to be taken care of. Just got a 91% approval rating. VA just got a 91% approval rating, highest ever. The highest it’s ever had, and accountability.(41:57)
We have people that were so scornful, they had hatred for our vets, they were treating our vets badly, our vets have to be treated great, but you couldn’t fire them. They could be sadistic, they could be thieves, you couldn’t fire them because the civil service unions, et cetera. Couldn’t fire them, and I got the accountability, VA accountability. Now you look at them, they don’t do a good job for our vets, you say, “Jim, you’re fired. Boom. Get out.” That’s the story. We actually terminated over 8,000 people that were not treating our vets well and they were for a long time. It sounds a little bit cold but the truth is they got to treat our vets well, right? So they have to do it, but we got accountability and we got VA choice but to achieve the vision that we’ve been talking about for so long, we must finish the job and drain the Washington swamp once and for all and we’re doing it.(42:53)
For years left wing politicians smiled and looked at American workers right in the eye and took advantage of them and lied to them. They took your endorsements, they took your money and they took your votes and they did nothing. Then they turned around and inflicted one corrupt betrayal of the American middle class after another, whether it was NAFTA, TPP, the horrible Korea deal, the ridiculous Paris Climate Accord, how is it working out for Paris, not so good, and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization which is probably the worst of all the deals if you want to know the truth. That was where China signed that and they went up like a rocket ship and they violated the rules like nobody’s ever violated them before. In fact they’re considered a developing nation and because they’re a developing nation, they have advantages. Well we didn’t accept that, but for years they accepted that. By the way, Joe Biden supported every single one of those horrible disastrous sellouts. Under this administration, those days have been over and we’re not going back. We’re respected again as a country. We’re respected again. You may not feel it, although I think you do. You may not see it, you don’t read about it from the fake news but this country is respected again. We don’t let people take advantage of us, including our allies who took tremendous advantage of. Tremendous.(44:25)
Our allies took tremendous advantage of us both militarily where they don’t pay their bills. We protect them, they don’t pay. Like Germany, we’re reducing the force, they don’t pay, they’re delinquent. I say it all the time, they’re delinquent, they got to pay. We protect Germany from Russia and yet Germany’s paying billions of dollars a year, billions and billions to Russia for energy. So I say what’s that all about? So we protect and they pay money and we protect. So we don’t stand for things like that but we have many other things. I could stand up here all day long and tell you things that you wouldn’t even believe(45:03)
… the things I could stand up here all day long and tell you things that you wouldn’t even believe. To fully restore American prosperity, we must stop the radical left-wing movement that would destroy our country. They want to impose $3 trillion of new taxes on American families. They want to ban fracking, which will demolish your state, it will demolish Ohio oil and gas jobs. They want to rejoin the disastrous Paris climate accord, where you’ll pay billions and billions of dollars for the privilege of getting ripped off by other countries. And inflict a socialist takeover of the US economy known as the horrendous Green New Deal, was conceived by a young woman, AOC plus 3, I say, AOC, that’s a real beauty, isn’t it? She knows as much about the environment… Do we have any young children here? As that young child over there, I think he knows more. And she certainly knows nothing about the economy. And if they ever had their chance, you would find that out, and it wouldn’t take very long. Venezuela, was a very wealthy country 20 years ago, one of the wealthiest. Per capita, one of the wealthiest.(46:13)
Tremendous oil reserves, everything. Now, they don’t have food, they don’t have water, they don’t have medicine, they don’t have anything. Same thing could happen, same… We’re similar ideology. They also want to throw open American borders, give free taxpayer funded healthcare to illegal aliens, defund police, abolish ICE, abolish borders, no more borders, and abolish basically the American Dream, this is Joe Biden. And does anybody really think he’s strong enough to stand up to these ruthless vicious people? You look at Portland, you look at what’s going on in Seattle, these are the people that you’re dealing with. If I didn’t send in the troops, if I didn’t send in the great people from Homeland Security, you’d have courthouses and post offices and everything else burned down, blown up. And we may send in something else, because you know what? They’ve been riding now for 70 days and the mayor thinks it’s just wonderful and the governor has no idea what she’s doing, I’ve never seen people like this.(47:15)
Remember in Seattle, where they took over a big chunk of the City of Seattle, and the mayor said, “It’s going to be a summer of love.” And I said, “She’s just kidding, right? Isn’t she?” She wasn’t kidding. But we were all set to send in the troops, send in the people that we were going to send in, and what happened is amazing. We told them, and all of a sudden the police went out and they cleaned it up. But that place would still be occupied if we didn’t get involved. Same thing with Minneapolis. Minneapolis was a disaster. After five or six days, they were going to lose that whole city. We sent in the National Guard, they took care of things in about one hour. Remember the scene of them walking down the street, firing the tear gas? Now you’re not even allowed, if you’re looking at the other side, you’re not allowed to use tear gas or pepper spray. You can’t use any of that stuff.(48:07)
They can use Molotov cocktails and horrible things on you, but you’re not allowed to do anything. So, the police didn’t want to have anything to do with the convention in a great State, Wisconsin, Milwaukee, for the Democrats. You couldn’t use tear gas, you couldn’t use pepper spray, you couldn’t use anything, think of how ridiculous this is. And you won’t be able to use your guns because they’re going to end your Second Amendment as sure as you’re sitting there. But the proud people of Ohio, will not let that happen. Together we will preserve, protect, and defend, our American way of life. As long as I am President… Thank you. As long as I am President of the United States, I will fight for you with every ounce of energy and strength that I have. I will be your voice, I will defend your jobs, I will stand up to the foreign trade cheaters and violators that hate our country, I will never let you down, I will have your back 100%.(49:17)
For more than a century, the workers of this company have continued the proud tradition of American greatness embodied by your legendary founder, Louis Upton. It’s a heritage grounded in the values of hard work and determination, innovation and excellence, faith and family, loyalty and patriotism, passed down from one generation to the next, you have an incredible heritage. These are the values that have defined this company and defined our country from the very beginning. And they are the values that will define our future, that will ensure our success, and that will allow America to thrive and win for many generations to come. There is nobody that can defeat us, nobody. Now, I’d like to take just a moment to introduce a few of the Whirlpool men and women whose jobs I had the honor of taking decisive action to protect and to save. Carrie Wallace is an operations analyst whose family has 100 years of history at this very plant. Carrie, please come forward and say a few words, please. Thank you, Carrie.e: (50:43)
Good afternoon. Manufacturing is the heartbeat of this area. Whirlpool has an enormous impact on the State of Ohio economically. My family has probably worked in these walls for four generations, like Mr. President said, for, combined, over a hundred years. I had the opportunity to get some advice from my mother, advice that was passed down from my grandfather, which I was actually just able to pass down to my nephew, there is not another company that would provide financial security and career opportunities in this area like Whirlpool. It’s true, the opportunities here are endless for us. Whirlpool has rewarded me with a completely new family also, I work with 3,500 proud individuals. Together, we build American made quality products here in Clyde, we bleed Whirlpool glue. I’m grateful for the support that we received in 2018 from the president, that support gives us the ability to compete and deliver in the market place now and for many generations to come.(52:07)
Thank you, Carrie. Wow. Great job. Marcos Ontiveros, is a first generation American who started at this plant to support his family 17 years ago. Marcos rose through leadership to become a production lead. Marcos, please come up and say a few words, please.ros: (52:40)
Thank you, Mr. President. As the president said, I started here about 16 going on 17 years. I was fresh out of high school, had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, but I knew I had two young children that I had to support and I had to support fast. I’m honored to say that I found that here at Whirlpool within these four walls, I have been able to not only provide but continue to develop myself into a career path that I never would have dreamed of when I was 18 years old coming out of there. As Ms. Wallace stated, I too I’m very grateful for the tariffs that were put against our foreign competitors in 2018, to take that instability away from our everyday lives and provide a longevity of stability and support for these American jobs here in these four walls. As our president said, I am a first generation from an immigrant family, my father was an immigrant, he came here to chase the American Dream, and I can say I’m fortunate enough to find my American Dream within these four walls here at Whirlpool. Thank you very much.(53:54)
Thank you, both. And Marcos had a beautiful speech written and he never looked down, you never even looked down at that speech. I’m impressed with both of you. I’m impressed. To every worker here at Whirlpool, thank you once again for welcoming us, it’s an honor to be here. And thank you for your commitment to American manufacturing, you’re a great company with great people. Together, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our factories, and we will bring back our American Dream. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you."
trump__briefing_sept23.txt,"(00:17)
Hello. Thank you very much. Thank you. Today, Johnson & Johnson announced that their vaccine candidate has reached the final stage of clinical trials. This is record time. This is the fourth vaccine candidate in the United States to reach the final stage of trial. So we have four candidates already at a very late date, late being a very positive word in this case. Earlier this year, Johnson & Johnson anticipated that they would reach phase one trials by September, but due to our support under Operation Warp Speed and to some of the incredible scientists involved, they’ve reached phase three trials by September, far ahead of schedule.(01:03)
We encourage Americans to enroll in the vaccine trial. It’s not only interesting, it’ll be a terrific thing for our country. We encourage everybody to enroll, as many people as we can. Today, my administration announced that we are awarding $200 million of CARES Act funding to all 50 states to prepare to distribute the vaccine to high-risk residents. And we want to do that the instant it is approved, not the following day, but the following moment. So we’re going to be doing that, and we’ll be getting it ready because we have some great vaccines going to be coming out through Operation Warp Speed. We also continue to accelerate life-saving therapies.(01:50)
We’re seeing promising results that are monoclonal antibody treatments, which help the immune system fight the virus and help very significantly, we’re finding, can reduce hospitalizations now by more than 70%. By cutting red tape and unleashing America’s medical genius, we’ve reduced the fatality rate 85% since April. For individuals under 50, they have a 99.98% rate of survival from the China virus. That’s a number that’s been really increasing substantially with time. As children go back to school, we’re encouraged that early research shows only a small degree of spread. Brown University conducted a study of more than 550 schools across 46 states and found that only 0.076% of students had confirmed cases of the virus. That’s a tiny percentage. And only 0.15% of teachers had confirmed cases.(02:54)
Patients coming to the emergency room due to the virus is down to only 1.6% of all emergency room visits, the lowest since the pandemic began. 1.6% emergency room visits. As far as protecting the vulnerable is concerned, we provided over $21 billion to our nursing homes, and we are really focused on the nursing homes, everybody and including our governors. Governors are working very closely with the task force and with the vice-president and everybody involved. We’ve sent rapid testing devices to nearly 14,000 certified nursing homes in the country. This week, we’re sending hundreds of thousands of additional rapid tests to nursing homes to ensure that they can test staff regularly. And the staff now is being tested on a regular basis, but very strongly at the finest level, the highest level and the best tests. We’re encouraged at the number of Americans getting the flu vaccine is increasing by roughly 50% compared to last year, substantially up. The flu, when it’s mixed with COVID or China virus, is going to be very interesting to see what happens, but that can drive numbers. And we just don’t know what that will be yet, but you’ll have flu numbers and you’ll have some COVID numbers. I think we’re rounding the turn very much. You see what’s happening in Europe. However, they have a very big spike. Countries that we thought were doing well aren’t doing well. They had some very big spikes. A very big surge.(04:39)
Months ago, we increased our nation’s procurement of the flu vaccine by 66% and we ask Americans to go get their annual flu shot as early as possible. It’s possible, I would imagine, Scott, that the flu can get mixed up with the virus and people can think it’s the virus when actually it’s another flu season coming on. I don’t know, I hope they can keep them separate. Can they keep them separate? (05:07)
I doubt they will. It’s going to be a very interesting time, but we have a flu season coming up. We’ve had some flu seasons which are really massive over the years, over many years and we have some that are much less so, but it’s still significant. So I hope they can separate them because it’s pretty close.(05:28)
In the past four months, we’ve created 10.6 million jobs. We cut unemployment rate nearly in half. The unemployment rate is cut nearly in half. Larry Kudlow is here. He’ll be discussing that in a little while. Retail sales are up 121%. That’s far above what we thought. Manufacturing is up 61%. That’s also above our schedule and our schedule is a heavy schedule. Automobile production is up six fold. Homebuilders’ sentiment is at the highest level in history. That’s an amazing statement, Larry, the highest level in history. That means people are thinking good thoughts. Home sales are at the highest level in nearly 15 years. Small business optimism is higher than any time under the last administration, substantially higher, small business optimism higher than at any time, more than the last administration.(06:25)
Today, I was proud to award nine companies and organizations with the first ever Pledge to America’s Workers presidential award. This award recognizes outstanding training programs that are giving Americans the skills to hone a trade and earn a great living with great people. Over 400 companies have competed and committed to 16 million training opportunities for the American worker. And it’s really been amazing. We’ve created the fastest economic recovery in American history. You are witnessing it, you’re part of it. Our approach is pro-science, Biden’s approach is anti-science if you look. I don’t think they know what their approach is, although a lot of it is copied from what we’ve done.(07:09)
Biden opposed the China travel ban and the Europe travel ban. And the strategy that they have is just never ending lockdowns. We’re not locking down, We’re actually growing at a rate that we’ve never experienced before, but they’re talking about, “If you have a question, just lock it down.” We’re not doing that. You can’t do that. Our plan will crush the virus. Actually, Biden’s plan will crush America, if you think about it. You can’t lock down. Again, we’re growing at levels that nobody’s ever seen before. Our plan is unleashing a rapid recovery, our opponents plan would hurt America very badly, send us into a depression.(07:49)
And with all of that being said, we are going to be having a very exciting Saturday at five o’clock in the Rose garden where I’ll be putting forth my nominee for Supreme Court justice. I think it will be a great nominee, a brilliant nominee. As you know, it’s a woman. We’ve brought it down to five women. It’s time for a woman to be chosen with everything that’s happened. And with Justice Ginsburg’s passing, we are going to go sometime tomorrow morning, as I understand it, to pay our respects and we’ll be over there. I guess they’d probably put that announcement down, but that’ll be done tomorrow morning. The vice-president was there today. And so if you have any questions, we’ll take a few questions.sstalk 00:08:48] Right here, Mr. President, real quickly. Win, loser, draw in this election. Will you commit here today for a peaceful transfer of power after the election, either-sferal of power after the election. And there has been rioting [inaudible 00:00:07], there’s been rioting in many cities across this country, your so-called red and blue states. Will you commit to making sure that there is a peaceful transferal of power after the election?(09:16)
Well, we’re going to have to see what happens. You know that I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster.derstand that but people are rioting. Do you commit to making sure that there’s a peaceful transferal of power?(09:29)
We want to have… Get rid of the ballots and we’ll have a very peaceful… There won’t be a transfer frankly, there’ll be a continuation. The ballots are out of control. You know it, and you know who knows it better than anybody else? The Democrats know it better than anybody else.second question is-(09:46)
Please. Go ahead.won’t you- (09:57)
I cannot hear you through your mask. (10:04)
She is on my list. I don’t have a meeting planned, but she is on my list. [crosstalk 00:10:11] talk about the meetings planned. I speak to people, I talk to people, but I don’t have a meeting plan, no. (10:23)
I didn’t know that. No. (10:34)
Yes. (10:38)
Well I thought it was… Really brilliant Kentucky attorney general, Daniel Cameron, is doing a fantastic job. I think he’s a star. And he made a statement that I’ll just read. “Justice is not often easy. It does not fit the mold of public opinion. And it does not conform to shifting standards. It answers only to the facts and to the law. If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge.” I mean, I heard that. I said, “Write that down for me please because I think it was a terrific statement.” He’s handling it very well. You know who he is. I think you know, I think everyone now knows who he is. I will be speaking to the governor. And we have a call scheduled to make very shortly, with the governor. I understand he’s called up the national guard, which is a good thing. I think it’s a very positive thing. And it’ll all work out. (12:01)
[crosstalk 00:12:01] good candidate. (12:20)
I can’t tell you what’s going to happen with the Democrats. I can say this, the person that I will be putting up and I won’t say that I’ve even chosen that person yet. I could say any one of the five, they’re outstanding women. But the person I’ll be putting up is highly qualified. Totally brilliant. Top of the line, academic student, the highest credentials. All of them have that. But the highest credentials. And you’ll see on Saturday who that is. I can’t imagine why a Democrat wouldn’t vote for this person.(13:01)
[crosstalk 00:13:01] on you. Yeah, please go ahead. (13:03)
Not you, you right here. (13:16)
I’m not a fan of hers. And I would say this and she probably has heard that, but I wish a lot of luck to Harry because he’s going to need it. (13:42)
Well, I tell you what, we’re looking at that. That has to be approved by the White House. We may or may not approve it. That sounds like a political move. Because when you have Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, these great companies coming up with the vaccines and they’ve done testing and everything else. I’m saying, why would they have to be adding great length to the process. We want to have people not get sick. The vaccine is very important. It’s the final step. I believe it’s going to be the final step. And no, we’re looking at that. But I think that was a political move more than anything else. (14:24)
Well, I have tremendous trust in these massive companies that are so brilliantly organized, in terms of what they’ve been doing with the tests. I mean, I don’t know that a government, as big as we are, could do tests like this. We’ve made it possible for them to do the tests in rapid fashion. But when they come back and they say that we have something that works and absolutely works. And they’re coming back with great numbers and statistics and tests and everything else that they have to come back with, I don’t see any reason why should be delayed further. Because if they delay it a week or two weeks or three weeks, that’s a lot of lives you’re talking about. Scott, would you agree with that? How do you feel about that? (16:02)
It sounded to me, extremely political. Why would they do this, when we come back with these great results. And I think you will have those great results. (16:10)
Why would we be delaying it? But we’re going to look at it. We’re going to take a look at it. And ultimately the White House has to approve it. And maybe we will and maybe we won’t, but we’ll be taking a look. I have to leave for an emergency phone call. I’m going to let Scott and Larry finish up. I’ll be back. I will see you tomorrow."
ttrump_drugs_Transcript.txt,"(00:02)
Well thank you very much everybody. Please. This promises to be a very big and very important meeting, so bear with me. Take a little while, but it has to do with a thing called drug pricing and as you know Congress has been working on this for decades and decades and we are now doing something that is going to be incredible for the American public. So today I’m taking a bold and historic, very dramatic action to reduce the price of prescription drugs for American patients and American seniors. Previous administrations did nothing, absolutely nothing, as drug lobbyists, special interests in foreign countries [inaudible 00:00:51] ripped off our citizens. Under the last administration alone, drug prices rose a staggering 55%. Thanks to my administration’s aggressive actions since taking office, we have successfully lowered drug prices for the first time in 51 years, but this reduction is still not close to what I want, what I expect, and I’m looking for help for our great seniors especially in particular, that’s what we’re doing today. You’ll hear something which will be very shocking, we’re doing things that nobody thought could be done and it’s going to have an incredible impact.(01:33)
Unfortunately we’ve been waiting for Congress to take action for many decades to reduce drug prices for more than just a small handful of people, but even the small handful of people never got price reductions, and I’m unwilling to wait any longer. Therefore today I’m signing four sweeping executive orders that will lead to a massive reduction in drug costs, massive. We’ve already gotten them down a little bit, but that’s not good enough, first time in 51 years as I said, but that’s not good enough. They represent the most far-reaching prescription drug reforms ever issued by a president. Nothing even close.(02:17)
Joining us for this important occasion are our Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex, where’s Alex? Alex, thank you, Alex Azar. CMS administrator, both doing a great job, Seema Verma. Seema, thank you Seema. FDA administrator Dr. Stephen Hahn, Stephen who is really speeding up the process of therapeutics and vaccines and I just heard from some of the big drug companies in there saying the FDA has really been moving the process along. Very important, Stephen. Can you move faster please? Okay. Thank you, great job. We appreciate it. And administrator of Health Resources and Service Administration Tom Engels. Tom, thank you. Thank you very much Tom for being here.(03:10)
We’re also pleased to have with us our great governor from the state of Florida, incredible state, incredible guy, Governor Ron DeSantis, thank you Ron very much. Appreciate it and you’re going to say a few words in the end, good. Representative Matt Gaetz, our friend. Where is … Hi Matt, you’re so quiet back there today. I’ve never seen you like that. Thank you Matt, great job you’re doing. Appreciate it very much. Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Jose Oliva. Jose, thank you Jose very much, good job, and many other state and local leaders, we have a lot of them. Thank you very much being here.(03:52)
The four orders I’m signing today will completely restructure the prescription drug market in terms of pricing and everything else to make these medications affordable and accessible for all Americans. The first order will require federal community health centers to pass the giant discounts they receive from drug companies on insulin and EpiPens directly to their patients. You know, insulin became so expensive people weren’t able to use it. They desperately needed it. We have it to a level that you’re not going to believe. EpiPens, likewise. You’ve been reading horrible stories about EpiPens over the last six, seven years. Horrible, horrible, horrible increases, where they went from almost nothing to massive amounts of money. We’re changing that right now. These providers should not be receiving discounts for themselves while charging their poorest patients massive full prices. Under this order the price of insulin for affected patients will come down to just pennies a day, pennies a day from numbers that you weren’t able to think about. It’s a massive cost savings.(05:08)
The second executive order I’m signing this afternoon will allow states, wholesalers and pharmacies to do something other politicians have promised for decades and decades but never done. They never delivered. We will finally allow the safe and legal importation of prescription drugs from Canada and other countries where the price for the identical drug is incredibly lower. It’s a difference like you wouldn’t believe. 70%, 80%, 90%, 30%, but massively lower than the identical drug made in the same plant, the same factory, the same exact drug, same everything, same box, same pill, and yet it’s 50, 60, 70% lower and this is something that Ron and I have been discussing from the time Ron got elected and I’ve been wanting to do it and it takes a long time from a legal standpoint and we’ve got it all worked out.(06:17)
So we are going to be getting massive drug savings in Florida and other states and we’ve had numerous states that wanted to do it. Ron really was at the forefront, I will say that, but you have other states that have caught on, it’s caught on very quickly. Didn’t take them long to figure that one out, Ron. It’s too obvious. We pay for all of the research and all of the developments and foreign countries pay absolutely nothing and our consumer gets charged. This has been going on for decades. The American people pay an average of over three times more for medicine than the Canadians. Many people go to Canada, I see it all the time, they go to Canada, buy drugs and then they come back, prescription drugs because they save so much money. The trip is well worth it.(07:03)
The Obama-Biden administration pledged to end this unfairness and allow drug importation but they never got it done. They were unable to get it done. They didn’t get a lot of things done, but under my administration we’re standing up to the lobbyists and special interests and fighting back against a rigged system. Rigged system, you’ve heard that word before. I am unrigging the system that is many decades old. We’re doing something that should have been done a long time ago.(07:35)
The third revolutionary order I’m signing today will prevent middlemen and women I guess, but you’ve heard about the middleman, right? The middleman that makes so much money, nobody knows who they are, nobody has any idea who they are, they make more money perhaps than even the drug companies themselves, and the drug companies in all fairness to them, big pharma and they’re doing a great job on the vaccines, they’re doing a great job on therapeutics I can tell you because I deal with them a lot, but I think the middlemen make more money than they do and they don’t do much. Maybe they don’t do anything. Some people say they don’t do anything. Nobody even knows who they are, but the middlemen are making a fortune and pharmacy benefit managers and people are just bilking Medicare patients with these high drug prices while they pocket gigantic discounts, gigantic discounts. The amount of money they have made over the decades is too incredible even to speculate or say, it’s massive.(08:48)
Some very rich people are not going to like me very much today, I can tell you. I probably know them very well, I probably see them in Palm Beach, but nobody ever talks about who they are. Everyone, I hear the middlemen for years, the middlemen. Right Alex? He doesn’t know who they are either but he knows they’re rich. They’re not going to be so rich anymore because the money is going down to reduce the price of drugs, prescription drugs. So that’s a big thing. That’s a tremendous step. It should have been taken a long time ago but they have a great deal of power and I don’t have to tell you how many phone calls I’ve had in the last few days when they heard I was going to be doing this. I’ve heard from people that I haven’t spoken to in a long time. Frequently drug companies give these middlemen discounts of up to 50% on the price of prescription drugs, but too often those discounts are not passed on to the pharmacy counter, meaning the people. This rule will pass, those billions and billions of dollars a year, I mean many, many billions a year in discounts onto patients, directly onto patients, saving Americans with high drug costs thousands of dollars a year. Individual people will make thousands of dollars a year.(10:11)
You’re not going to believe the impact the things we’re talking about today are going to have. Mark Meadows, our great chief is sitting here and he’s just … Can’t even believe it because he was a very successful congressman, he’s been after people to do this for a long time and they never got to the gate. I understand why, tremendous pressure. Tremendous pressure put on the president not to do it.(10:35)
The fourth and final order I’m signing today is the granddaddy of them all. We’ll end global freeloading on the backs of American patients and American seniors. For decades, our citizens have paid the highest prices for drugs, prescription drugs anywhere in the world and it’s not even close. Foreign nations have paid vastly less(11:03)
“Foreign nations have paid vastly less for the exact same drug again, and the exact same box, from the exact same plant, from the exact same company. They would pay 10%, 20%, 30% what our people are paying. A pill that would sell for $1 in certain countries, I won’t name them. They’re all allies, right? They call them allies. I call them so-called allies, but a pill that would cost a dollar could be 7, $8 in our country, same exact pill. We pay 80% more than nations like Germany, Canada and others for some of the most expensive medicines, identical in all respects. This means that Americans are funding the enormous cost of drug research and development for the entire planet. We are bearing the entire cost of all of this. They’re bearing none. They say, “This is what we’re going to pay.” In some cases, it’s a socialist country. So we’re paying to reduce drug prices in a socialist country. How does that work? How does that work?(12:21)
And these are things that should have been done a long time ago. And even from our standpoint, we would have done it more quickly, but we have to go through vast amounts of waiting periods, waiting times, and this is an incredible day. This is just a big day. It is a big day. I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time. We incredibly and foolishly bear the full cost of all research and development, which is massive. In all fairness to the drug companies, can take 15 years to get something approved, billions and billions of dollars for a simple drug. It also means that the US taxpayers are effectively subsidizing the socialist healthcare systems of foreign welfare states and many other countries. We will end that abuse and restore the principles of free enterprise, but this doesn’t even have to do with free enterprise. This has to do with common sense and courage, to be honest, and courage.(13:25)
Under this transformative order, Medicare will be required to purchase drugs at the same price as other countries pay. So we would pay four or five times more for a drug, we now pay … If somebody else pays $1 and we pay $5, we’re paying $1. Now what’s going to happen is their number will go up, our number will come very substantially down and we’ll all agree at two and a half or two or whatever the final number is. But if some country is paying wherever it may be in the world because they had a better negotiator, because they had smarter people that we have, and that’s what it’s all about. Maybe more honest people. Who knows? Could be a lot of things going, but we get now the lowest price anywhere in the world and no more will we have to suffer by saying, “Gee, why is it so much cheaper for the exact same drug in some other country?” We will determine what other medically advanced nations pay for the most expensive drugs. And instead of paying the highest price, Medicare will pay the lowest price and so will lots of other US buyers.(14:40)
Medicare is the largest purchase of drugs anywhere in the world by far. Medicare, largest purchaser of drugs in the world, and we’re finally going to use that incredible power to achieve a fairer and lower price for everyone. Everyone will get a fairer and much lower price. This is not talking about one half of a percent. This is big stuff. Under our ridiculous system, which has been broken for decades, we aren’t even allowed to negotiate the price of drugs. Can you believe it? I said, “When are we going to negotiate?” We’re not allowed. We’re restricted by Congress from negotiating the price of drugs. Can you imagine? You say, “I want to get a better price. Oh I’m sorry, sir. You’re not allowed to do that. That’s illegal.” What kind of a system is that? Do you think the world looks at us and said, “Where the hell did these people come from?” But they treat us very nicely. It’s going to end, okay? I see you’re a fan of what we’re saying. You must be a doctor. Are you a doctor? Yeah. Doctors know. The doctors know. You’ve known that for years. We’re not allowed to negotiate. Can you believe it? We just have to take whatever it is.(15:54)
I’m pleased to announce that as a result of the orders I’m signing today, the heads of the major drug companies have requested a meeting to discuss how we can quickly and significantly lower drug prices and out of pocket expenses for Americans. They want to do what’s right. Look, they’re going to do what’s right. Look, I think it’s so important what they’re doing on therapeutics and vaccines, and we’re going to see them on Tuesday. We’ll see if we can do something here, but this could have been done a long time ago. The drug company executives will be at the White House on Tuesday, and they have some ideas how to significantly reduce drug prices. We’ve already given them to you. I don’t know if they can possibly do something to substitute for what’s called favored nations. Favored nations, that means we get the lowest price anywhere in the world. Whoever gets the best price, congratulations. Thank you very much for being a good negotiator because we now get the lowest price too. Should have been done a long time ago.(16:58)
If these talks that are successful, we may not need to implement the fourth executive order, which is a very tough order for them. Very tough, and I understand that, and we have a lot of respect for our great pharmaceutical companies, drug companies. We have a lot of respect for them, so we’ll see what they have to say on Tuesday. Maybe they have an idea that’s good, but it’s got to be very substantial. They’re actually in favor of the rebate rule, of the roll back because they say that’s people getting money that aren’t even doing anything for it and bigger money than they’re getting I believe. If they are not, the order will be implemented. If we don’t do a deal or agree to something, the order, number four, favored nations, a big order. They’re all big, all four are very big, by the way, very big. But the fourth order, we’re going to hold that until August 24th, hoping that the pharmaceutical companies will come up with something that will substantially reduce drug prices, and the clock starts right now. So it’s August 24th at 12:00 o’clock, after which the order on favored nations will go into effect and Mark I’ll hold you to it please. 12:00 o’clock not 12:01 right?(18:18)
In the meantime, we’re working very hard on therapeutics and a vaccine for the China virus, which remains our top priority and which are coming along at record speed. Thank you very much Dr. Hahn, been fantastic. You really have been fantastic. Two vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month, right? Two. And several more vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks. I did speak to one just recently. They’re working on therapeutics as opposed to vaccine and frankly, that’s the most exciting to me. We can walk into a hospital right now and get people better. I like that even more, but the vaccine long-term will be great.(19:05)
So we have them both going. They’re both going rapidly and they’re both going very well and I guess the early indications are beyond happy, right? It’s beyond happy. We’re mass producing all of the most promising candidates already so that on day one … That means that we think we have the answer. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be making that bet. It’s a big bet. So that in day one, the day we get it approved, it will be available immediately. Doctor, is that correct? So if we get it approved … Now, normally this process would take to get up to where we are now three years, four years. I’ve heard numbers like that, and we did it in literally a matter of weeks. It’s a really incredible thing.(19:51)
One of the other things, I was talking about drugs in the pipeline for getting drugs approved, and it does cost billions of dollars, and it would be 12 years, 15 years. And under Dr. Hahn and Scott, before you worked very hard, Scott Gottlieb, we’ve got that down to a number that’s less than half and we’re going down further. We have to make sure it’s safe and right to try came out of this whole thing where we have a drug that we think is good. Matt Gates helped with this and getting it approved and Mark, when he was a Congressman, but we had great help from certain people, but right to try is incredible. We have a drug that works, but it’s got to go through this very long and very detailed process for purposes of safety and to make sure it’s good.(20:40)
If somebody is terminally ill, very sick, person not going to make it, person very sick, we passed legislation which they’ve been trying to get for 42 years. It’s called right to try where people sign a document that if it doesn’t work out, they’re not suing the drug company, they’re not suing the insurance company and they’re not suing our country. And instead of traveling, if they have money, they travel to Asia and they travel to Europe. They travel all over the world in the hopes of finding a cure, they’re terminally ill. If they have no money, sadly they go home with no hope and they die. We have now a program, right to try, finally happened after, I guess as long as you’ve been a doctor, long before you became a doctor, right? They’ve been trying to get this, but we have a program where they can try these really promising medicines and you have no idea how successful this has already been. It’s incredible.(21:41)
And one of the things that really came out of it was the biggest problem for the drug companies. They didn’t want it because they didn’t want it in their sample. Because people that are that sick, they don’t want in the sample. And so we created a separate sample so it doesn’t hurt them. But one of the things that’s come out of it is if it works, what is a better testing formula than that? Some-(22:03)
What is a better testing formula than that, somebody that’s terminally ill and all of a sudden makes it? We’re having examples of that. It’s been incredible. It’s been an incredible program. I hope somebody’s going to be able to write a story about it because it’s been one of the things that I’m very proud of it. I love the name even. They have the right to try a drug that’s not going to be available for two years or three years, the terminally ill. Before, you’d say, “Well, the terminally ill. Yeah, but we don’t want to give them a drug that’s going to hurt them.” Well, they going to die. They didn’t want to give them a drug because they thought it might be dangerous. Perhaps, in some cases, it may be dangerous, but we’re having tremendous success with that program. I’m proud of it.(22:44)
Additionally, my administration has secured 90% of the world’s supply of the drug, remdesivir, which is having great impact, for the United States and research continues daily on a lot of promising treatments as I said. As we take these historic actions, we’re joined today by Americans who have already benefited from the steps my administration has already taken to reduce the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs. We’re going to have a big healthcare bill that we’re going to be putting up very shortly, and it’s going to be very complete.(23:20)
Today, what we’re doing on prescription drugs… Again, we’ll have to see what happens on August 25th. We’ll either do the favored nations or not depending on the drug companies, but what we’re putting up in a very short period of time on healthcare will be incredible. We have another one coming on immigration, tremendous bill on immigration. It’ll be, I think, something that nobody thought we would be able to get, so that’ll be great. Paul Madden is a senior citizen who relies on insulin every day. He was paying a fortune, everything, to get it. Paul, if you could… I think Paul’s in the audience. If you could please come up and say a few words about your experience. Thank you, Paul. Thank you very much.(24:14)
So you can hear me.(24:16)
That’s better.(24:18)
Mr. President, thank you so very much for this time to share a few key points supporting your leadership work, reducing the price of insulin, and other diabetes- related medicines used by 34 Americans each day to live healthier fuller lives. As you heard, my name is Paul Madden. I’m a Bostonian. I have lived with insulin-dependent diabetes for 59 years.(24:44)
Beginning Medicare, last year, I quickly realized that my ability to afford prescribed insulins that worked best for my health was no longer possible because of their excessive high price. Soaring costs have impacted the quality of my life. Remember that, now, about 34 million people with diabetes. It’s impacted so much I even started to use a 30-year-old insulin to survive, which does not do quite the same great job of balancing my diabetes. Your work, sir, to ensure that insulin is affordable under Medicare will help guarantee that I and millions of seniors who take insulin realize healthier, more productive and dependent, happier lives. Thank you for continuing your commitment to ensure affordability and access for all who use insulin for people with diabetes and so that our children and grandchildren will directly benefit from our improved health. Thank you.(25:57)
Thank you very much. Thank you, Paul. That’s great. It’s actually [inaudible 00:26:04] from many, many, many dollars, unaffordable by most people, to pennies, literally pennies a month. I want to thank Seema Verma. You worked so hard on that one. Seema, could you just say something about that? It was the price. Would you come up just for a second, Seema Verma, and just tell them about what we’ve done with respect to very badly-needed insulin.(26:34)
Well, the Senior Savings Model that we developed under the president’s leadership is going to reduce the cost of insulin to $35 a month for our seniors. That represents a 66% savings.(26:48)
[inaudible 00:26:48].(26:48)
I can tell you the vice president and I were traveling in Pennsylvania. We had a gentleman that came up to us, and he showed us his insulin and he said, “You’re going to save me $5,000 a year,” so thank you, President Trump, for your leadership.(27:06)
Thank you very much. Great job. That’s a great job. That you. That’s a tremendous difference. We’re also joined by Andrea [Eccles 00:27:19], a dental hygienist from Brunswick, Maryland. Andrea, please come up and say a few words. Thank you. Please.: (27:26)
Thank you, Mr. President.(27:36)
Thank you very much.: (27:42)
My name is Andrea Eccles, and I am a dental hygienist in Brunswick, Maryland. I was widowed when my husband died in a tragic auto accident and my twin girls were four at the time. He held our family health insurance through his corporate job, and I suddenly found myself having to work full time and put my children in full-time daycare, watch my budget very closely. This is a number of years ago, and at that time, my only choice for healthcare… I work in a very small dental office, and so my only choice for healthcare at that time was what I call the unaffordable care act.: (28:26)
I was paying very high premiums and copays and way too much for prescription drugs. Interestingly, you referenced the EpiPen. I had to purchase that be pins and inhalers. It got to the point actually where I couldn’t even afford to renew the EpiPen. I think I still have a probably 15-year-old EpiPen at my house because they’ve got to be $700. But in my case, this led-(28:57)
What did this start at? It’s 700. What did they start-: (29:01)
The original EpiPen, I feel like it was like a $20 copay way back when I first got it, but then as each year… It just kept going up, up to the… But I incidentally ended up with all of these increases in copays and everything over time. I ended up with a over $15,000 medical debt. I’m just a regular person. I don’t have some ridiculously major illnesses or anything.: (29:34)
But during your presidency, President Trump, my premiums have decreased exponentially, and my coverage has increased. My copays have just about disappeared or gone way down, and prescription drugs that I used to budget for myself are at $150 a month is now $15 a month, and because of you, I’m spending hundreds of dollars less a month. This type of savings makes it a really big difference for a single mother such as myself. I just want to thank you so much from the bottom of my-(30:11)
[crosstalk 00:30:11].: (30:11)
… heart and for all that you do and for all of your policies that are helping all of us Americans.(30:17)
Thank you very [crosstalk 00:30:18].: (30:18)
Thank you.(30:24)
[inaudible 00:30:24]. That’s really nice. I appreciate it. Some big difference. That’s not a 1% or 2%. That’s big dollars. I want to thank you both very much. Thank you very much. Today’s actions continue my administration’s relentless drive to deliver better healthcare at a lower cost. I signed an executive order to fight kidney disease. That was such a big thing. That was such a beautiful, important thing to do with more transplants and better treatment. People with kidney disease go through hell. They go through hell. Their life is hell. We’ve done a lot, and we’re very proud of it. We’ve really seen some results that are incredible.(31:09)
We dramatically expanded the telehealth for all American patients and families in telehealth in this pandemic era have been, it’s increased by, I would say, it was like 1,020%. Incredible. It’s been up at a level that nobody’s ever imagined, and it actually is very good. It’s been something that has come out of the pandemic. One of the only good things that came out of it, frankly, is people are realizing how good that is. It really worked out well.(31:44)
We strongly defended Medicare and Social Security, and we’ll always protect and we have been protecting and we’ll always will protect Republicans, totally protect preexisting conditions. Very important. Nothing’s going to happen to your preexisting protections. We ended the gag clause that prevented pharmaceuticals and pharmacists from telling patients how to buy less expensive drugs. We had a clause that if you went up to a pharmacist… Is this the correct statement to-2:16)
[crosstalk 00:32:16].(32:16)
… and it’s not even believable. You couldn’t talk about price. If the man or woman behind the counter started talking about price, what happens? You take the license away? This is not even believable. Think of that. It prevented pharmacists from telling patients how to buy less expensive drugs. “We have a less expensive drug that’s just as good. I can’t talk about it.” They can’t even say that. I wonder why? Can you imagine these things? We approved a record number of affordable low-cost generics. We’ve increased generics more than any administration by many times, and many of the generics, I would say from what I’m hearing, all of the generic, sometimes people want to see a label, but they say they’re just as good-(33:03)
… people want to see a label. But they say they’re just as good as the others except you pay a lot less money. We’ve increased them more than any administration, not even close. And we capped insulin costs that we just discussed for many Medicare recipients, and for a lot of other people at just $35 a month, and it was many times that, as you’ve just heard. Right To Try, I talked about. So proud of it. Nothing matters more to me than the health and wellbeing of the American people. There’s nothing more important to me. With today’s actions, we’re ending decades of sellouts, betrayals, and broken promises from Washington. You’ve had a lot of broken promises. I would say exclusively, broken. You’ve had it. It’s been uniformed, broken promises. We’re putting patients over lobbyists, senior citizens before special interests, and we’re putting America first. I’m putting America first.(33:58)
When you look at what we’re doing with Favored Nations on the basis that it kicks in on August 25th. We’ll see. Let’s see what they have to offer. But when you think about it, what are we doing? We’re putting America first. When you hear other countries getting a much better deal on drug prices, there are people that have told me this is more important than healthcare. We’re doing healthcare, but this is more important than anything, the price of drugs. They were getting slaughtered, slaughtered by drug prices. So thank you very much. I want to thank you all for being here. I’d like to ask, if I could, Alex to come up, please, Secretary Azar, to say a few words, and then I’ll sign an Executive Order.(34:39)
I’d also like to ask the Governor of Florida. Ron, you’re going to come up and say a few words and we’ll sign up and you’ll go out and buy those drugs and save 50 or 60% for the people of Florida? And other people will be joining you. And that’s great. I want to let you. You will tell me how you do and I’d work on it really fast because now with all of the media back here, you’re under extraordinary pressure, and you never have pressure. One thing I’ll tell you about Ron, Matt will tell you, he handles pressure well. And you’re doing a great job. Thank you very much. Please. Alex.x Azar: (35:12)
Well, Mr. President, thank you so much for your leadership here. You charged all of us with four goals, ending foreign free riding, improving how our federal programs pay for drugs, lowering out of pockets for our citizens, and getting list prices down. And you did your Drug Pricing Blueprint in May of 2018. Before then, every single year there were massive drug price increases, massive price inflation. Since your Drug Pricing Blueprint, that level of inflation has stopped. And that was an incredible accomplishment. But you said, “That’s not good enough. I want more, even more change for the American people.” And today you’re delivering. Allowing importation. Presidents before you have over and over again to allow the safe importation of drugs from lower cost countries. You’re the first President to deliver on it.x Azar: (36:07)
You’re going to have Governor DeSantis’ program for States and tribes to import. You’re going to have a personal importation program where individuals can get their drugs low costs from abroad. And you’re going to have an insulin re-importation program so Americans can get their insulin re-imported from Canada at lower prices. You’re taking on the federal health centers. You’re taking on the issue that they are getting radical discounts on insulin and epi-pens and you’re going to make sure low income Americans get the benefit of those discounts. And you’re taking on the middlemen. $30 billion a year of concealed kickbacks to middlemen are going to now flow to Medicare patients when they show up at the pharmacy, an average of 30% discounts at out-of-pockets when they show up at a pharmacy thanks to the President’s bold action.x Azar: (36:52)
And we’re going to end foreign free riding, taking on foreign socialist systems that have been living off of American seniors’ investments by overpaying in drug prices, and now they’re going to have to bear their fair share. I’ve got to tell you, what you’ve done and what you’re doing today, you’ve done more than any President in American history to take on drug prices. You’re taking on the drug companies, you’re taking on the middlemen, you’re taking on the European socialists, all for the forgotten men and women of America who show up at a pharmacy counter. And for that, I am so proud of what you were doing today. Thank you, Mr. President.(37:37)
Thank you very much. Thank you, Alex. Please, Ron, please.DeSantis: (37:53)
Well, Mr. President, thanks for your leadership on this. When we started the legislative session in Florida in 2019, our Speaker of the House, Jose Oliva, was here with me. He had a big healthcare agenda. So we did some phenomenal things like expand telehealth, repeal certificate of need laws. But he really wanted to do something big on prescription drugs. I did too, because it’s obviously an issue. But I told Jose, I said, “Listen, we’ve got to find a way where we will actually be able to accomplish something. I don’t want to just throw a flare up there and then virtue signal that we’re doing something about drugs and then nothing works.” And so there was a provision of law which required the federal government’s approval. So we had a plan in Florida. We moved forward. I went to see you.DeSantis: (38:36)
And this law has been on the books for at least almost 20 years, so other Presidents have had the ability to pull this lever and they didn’t do it. And I went up and asked you, and not everyone was in favor of you doing it. You had a lot of people saying, “Don’t do it.” But you were laser focused on lowering drug prices for people, particularly our seniors in the State of Florida, and that was abundantly clear. And so when Florida then moved forward, we knew we had your support. We knew that this day would eventually come. And I think that the fact that we’re standing here today, obviously, Florida, we did some groundwork, but really it’s a result of Presidential leadership. The people of Florida want to thank you for siding with us on this.DeSantis: (39:20)
Like I said, this could have been done for almost 20 years and it hasn’t been done. You’re the one that got it done. So, Mr. President, thank you.(39:27)
Thank you very much, Ron. Thank you. Thank you. So we’re going to sign four very important documents. I just want to thank Amy. And congratulations, Amy, to you. That elevation is a big one. And you’re going to do fantastically. Russell, congratulations. He just got confirmed and we appreciate it. Fantastic job. And Pat, thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it.

ttrump_jonathan_Transcript.txt,"(01:07)
Okay. (01:10)
Thank you very much. (01:16)
Sure. (01:29)
To an extent. I also think in terms of the downside. I do. I’ve been given a lot of credit for positive thinking, but I also think about downside because only a fool doesn’t. (01:49)
I think you have to have a positive outlook. Otherwise, you would have nothing without a positive outlook. I think we’ve done an incredible job, between the ventilators and stopping very infected people from China coming in, meaning putting the ban on China, which frankly nobody wanted me to do, practically nobody because it was very early in January. Then putting the ban on Europe, not an easy thing to do. When you put a ban on Europe, that’s a big thing. We would have probably lost hundreds of thousands of lives more had I not done that.(02:18)
And all of the experts, every one of them, not one of them wanted to do it. They thought it was too severe. Three months later, they’re all saying, I’m glad you did it. (02:59)
Look, look. (03:01)
Nobody knew what this thing was all about. This has never happened before. 1917, but it was a totally different, it was a flu in that case. Okay? But other than 1917, there’s never been anything like this. And by the way, if you watch the fake news on television, they don’t even talk about it. But you know, there are 188 of the countries right now that are suffering, some proportionately far greater than we are. Okay? As bad as we are. (03:24)
Some proportionately greater than we are. Right now, right now, Spain is having a big spike. There are tremendous problems in the world. You look at Moscow, look at what’s going on with Moscow. Look at Brazil, look at these countries what’s going on. This was sent to us by China, one way or the other, and we’re never going to forget it. Believe me, we’re never going to forget it.(03:46)
And we were beating China at every single point. We were beating them on trade, we were making progress like nobody’s ever made progress. Before the pandemic, they had the worst year, Jonathan, that they’ve had in 67 years. You know that. With the tariffs and everything else I did, we would taking in billions of dollars. I was giving some of it to the farmers. The farmers were doing well because they were targeting the farmers, I was targeting China. We were doing good.(04:14)
Then all of a sudden, the game changed, and I had to close it down. I closed down the greatest economy ever in history. (04:21)
Well, wait. And then, I closed it down. And now we’re opening it. And we saved, by the way, by closing it down, we saved millions of lives. If we would have gone to herd and we knew very little about the disease, if we would’ve gone herd, we would have lost millions of people, millions of people. One person’s too much. We’re at 140,000 people. One person is too much. We’re at 140. We would have lost millions of people. And those people that really understand it, they really understand it. They said, it’s incredible the job that we’ve done. And again, I bring it up, the ban- (05:00)
Banning China from coming in far earlier- (05:05)
What’s that? (05:08)
Nobody knew the extent. Nobody knew how contagious it was. You know What? Maybe China knew. (05:30)
By the way, [crosstalk 00:05:30] Excuse me, Jonathan, we had a 19,000 seat stadium and first of all, we had 12,000 people, not 6,000, which you reported and other people reported. But you couldn’t even get in. It was like an armed camp. (05:41)
Because they had 120 Black Lives Matter people there and Tulsa- (05:45)
Excuse me, wait. And Tulsa, well, because that area was a very good area at the time. It was an area that was pretty much over. [crosstalk 00:05:55] After, after, a month later, it started going up. That’s a month later, but Tulsa was a very good, Oklahoma was doing very well as a state. It was almost free. It spiked a month later, a month and a half, two months later. But it was a good area.(06:09)
We had a tremendous crowd, we had tremendous response. It was like an armed camp. You couldn’t even get through. You couldn’t get anybody in. But we had 12,000 people. It was incorrectly reported. The other thing we had that nobody wants to talk about, so Fox broadcast it. It was the highest rating in the history of Fox television Saturday night. It was the highest rating. (06:34)
Well, wait a minute. You’re saying something. That speech was the highest rated speech in the history of Fox television on Saturday night. And nobody says that. (06:52)
I’m just saying this. I’m just saying this. At the time… And I canceled another one. I had to cancel it and we were going to have a great crowd in New Hampshire, and I canceled it for the same reason. (07:19)
Well, what’s your definition of control? (07:21)
Yeah. Under the circumstances right now, I think it’s under control. I’ll tell you what- (07:27)
They are dying. That’s true. And it is what it is. But that doesn’t mean we aren’t doing everything we can. It’s under control as much as you can control it. This is a horrible plague that beset us. (07:43)
Well, I’ll tell you, I’d like to know if somebody… First of all, we have done a great job. We’ve gotten the governors everything they needed, they didn’t do their job. Many of them didn’t and some of them did. Someday we’ll sit down. We’ll talk about the successful ones, the good ones. Look at that smile. The good ones and the bad. We had good and bad. And we had a lot in the middle, but we had some incredible governors. I could tell you right now who the great ones are and who the not so great ones are, but the governors do it. We gave them massive amounts of material. (08:23)
By the way, not get worse like the original flow. You understand that. (08:29)
But If you look, Arizona’s going down. Texas is going down, and Florida is going down. (08:52)
No, I’m not going to get bored. I never get bored of talking about this, it’s too big a thing. (08:54)
And again, it should have been stopped by China, and it wasn’t. (09:00)
We have it here. (09:02)
No, I think I’m very consistent. No, this is a very serious thing. We have 140,000 people at this moment. (09:09)
This is a very, very serious situation. And what you have to do, is handle it the best it can be handled. And again, I’m working with the governors. I got them tremendous amounts of equipment that they would have never gotten. Jonathan, they wouldn’t have equipment now, if I didn’t get. (09:34)
Well, we have great testing. We’re doing and many other people do- (09:39)
Let me explain the testing. We have tested more people than any other country, than all of Europe put together times two. We have tested more people than anybody ever thought of. India has 1.4 billion people. They’ve done 11 million tests. We’ve done 55, it’ll be close to 60 million tests. And there are those that say, you can test too much. You do-(10:03)
And there are those that say you can test too much. You do know that. (10:05)
Oh, just read the manuals, read the books. (10:08)
Read the books. Read the books. (10:11)
What testing does- (10:14)
Let me explain. What testing does, it shows cases. It shows where there may be cases. Other countries test… you know when they test? They test when somebody is sick. That’s when they test. And I’m not saying they’re right or wrong. Nobody has done it like we’ve done it. We’ve gotten absolutely no credit for it. But we’ve come up with so many different tests. The only thing that we have now is some people have to wait longer than we’d like them to. We want it- (10:39)
We want point to point. We want to have a five minute to a 15 minute test. (10:44)
And we have… and like many others- (10:47)
And, from what I understand, we’re close to 50% where it’s point to point tests. We are making thousands of instruments, thousands of tests right now, tens of thousands that can be distributed to various parts of the country. But you have to understand. And we’ve even sent some of them to other countries where they had a big problem. Jonathan, almost 50%, in fact, I think the number might be over, is immediate testing. The other is tough. You take a test. You have to send it to a laboratory. Let’s say that takes a day. Let’s say it’s a day. (11:20)
So, it’s three, or four, or five days. (11:21)
There is nothing you can do about that. (11:25)
I think that you will have that relatively soon. I mean- (11:28)
You already have half. (11:31)
I would much rather get back to you. (11:32)
Because I don’t want to have you write in one month, I didn’t make it. (11:35)
I missed it by a day. (11:37)
And it’s a headline. (11:40)
Excuse me. One thing I would say about testing. (11:43)
Because we test so much, we show cases. So, we show many, many cases. We show tremendous number of cases. I know you’re smiling when I say that, but I’m telling you. (11:54)
I know. Other countries don’t test like we do. So, they don’t show case. (12:06)
We’re testing so much because we had the ability to test. (12:09)
Because we came up with test- (12:11)
Jonathan, we didn’t even have a test. When I took over, we didn’t even have a test. Now, in all fairness- (12:21)
There was no test for this- (12:23)
Excuse me. I was going to say- (12:23)
There was no test for this. We didn’t have a test because there was no test. (12:27)
And, in a very short order, we got one test. We got another test. (12:31)
We got another. Many of those tests are now obsolete because it’s called science. (12:34)
And, all of a sudden, something is better. But, because we tested so many people, 55, 60 million people, very soon, we get cases. You test. Some kid has even just a little runny nose. It’s a case. And then, you report many cases. So, we look like we have more cases than massive countries like China, which by the way, doesn’t report, as you know. (13:00)
No. No. The point is- (13:01)
The point is, because we are so much better at testing than any other country in the world, we show more cases. (13:12)
Okay. No, no. (13:14)
If you look at death- (13:16)
Let’s look. Let’s look. (13:17)
Take a look at some of these charts. (13:20)
We’re going to look. (13:21)
And, if you look at death per- (13:25)
Here is one. Well, right here, United States is lowest in numerous categories. We’re lower than the world. (13:37)
We’re lower than Europe. (13:40)
Look. Take a look. Right there. Here is case death. (13:55)
You can’t do that. (13:58)
You have to go by where… look. Here is the United States. You have to go by the cases. The cases are there. (14:07)
What it says is, when you have somebody where there’s a case- (14:11)
The people that live from those cases. (14:22)
No. Because you have to go by the cases. (14:28)
You don’t know that. (14:30)
You don’t know that. (14:33)
I won’t get into that because I have a very good relationship with the country. (14:37)
But you don’t know that. And they have spikes. Look, here’s one of- (14:40)
Here’s one. Here’s one right here, United States. (14:44)
You take the number of cases. (14:45)
Now look, we’re last meaning we’re first. (14:48)
We have the best. (14:50)
Take a look again. It’s cases. (14:52)
And we have cases because of the testing. (14:59)
No, but you’re not reporting it correctly, Jonathan. (15:03)
If you take a look at this other chart… look, this is our testing. I believe this is the testing. Yeah. (15:10)
No, wait a minute. Well, don’t we get credit for that? And, because we do more tests, we have more cases. In other words, we test more. We have… now, take a look. The top one, that’s a good thing not a bad thing. But the top… Jonathan- (15:28)
Well, they don’t even- (15:29)
Well, they very rarely talk- (15:32)
If you watch the news or read the papers, they usually talk about new cases, new cases, new cases. (15:38)
Well, you look at death. (15:39)
Death is way down from where it was. (15:43)
Death- (15:46)
Death… excuse me. Where it was is much higher than where it is right now. (15:52)
It spiked, but now it’s going down again. (15:53)
It’s gone down in Arizona. It’s going down in Florida. (15:56)
It’s going down in Texas. Take a look at this. These are the tests. (16:01)
Yeah. It leveled out and it’s going down. That’s my report, as of yesterday. (16:06)
It is going down in Arizona. It is gong down in Texas. (16:10)
And it is spiked. It spiked and is now going down in Florida. It’s evened out and going down in Florida. (16:16)
But you have to look at this. This is the number of tests compared to the rest of the world. (16:22)
Right. And, because we’ve done more tests, we have more cases. (16:25)
Now, you can take them back. Check it out in your office. (16:37)
Right. Right. (16:42)
No. That was a phone call to discuss other things. And frankly, that’s an issue that many people said was fake news. (16:51)
I think a lot of people. If you look at some of the wonderful folks from the Bush Administration, some of them, not any friends of mine, were saying that it’s a fake issue. But a lot of people said, it’s a fake issue. (17:05)
But we had a call. We had a call talking about nuclear proliferation. (17:08)
Which is a very big subject where they would like to do something. And so would I. We discussed numbers things. We did not discuss that. No. (17:15)
I have never discussed it with him. No. I would. I’d have no problem with it. (17:19)
But you know it never got to- (17:24)
It’s interesting. Nobody ever brings up China. They always bring Russia, Russia, Russia. If we can do something with Russia in terms of nuclear proliferation, which is a very big problem. (17:34)
Bigger problem than global warming. (17:36)
A much bigger problem than global warming in terms of the real world, that would be a great thing. No. It never reached my desk. (17:43)
You know why? Because intelligence, they didn’t think it was real. (17:50)
They didn’t think it was worthy. I wouldn’t mind. If it reached my desk, I would have done something about it. It never reached my desk because- (17:58)
I do. (17:58)
I read it a lot. (17:59)
I read a lot. They like to say I don’t read. I read a lot. (18:04)
I comprehend extraordinarily well, probably better than anybody that you’ve interviewed in a long time. I read a lot. I spend a lot of time at meetings. Usually it’s once a day or at least two or three times a week, intelligence meetings. (18:19)
Talking about India, talking about the problems with China. (18:22)
Talking about so many different elements of the world. (18:25)
The world is a very angry place, if you look all over the world. We call up. I see a 22 soldiers were killed in India with China fighting over the border. It’s been raging for many, many decades. And they’ve been fighting and back and forth. I have so many briefings on so many different countries, but this one didn’t reach my desk. (19:10)
Well, we sold them weapons when they were fighting Russia too. When they were fighting with the Taliban in Afghanistan- (19:18)
Well, it’s a different… I’m just saying. Yes. (19:21)
I’m just saying we did that too. (19:23)
I don’t know. I didn’t ask Nicholson about that. He was there for a long time. Didn’t have great success because he was there before me. And then, ultimately, I made a change. (19:36)
I don’t know. When you say arming is- (19:39)
Paying or they- (19:42)
I have heard that but, again, it’s never reached my desk. (19:50)
Hey, Russia doesn’t want anything to do with Afghanistan. Let me just say about Russia. Russia used to be a thing called the Soviet Union. Because of Afghanistan, they went bankrupt. They became Russia, just so you do understand. Okay? The last-(20:03)
Went bankrupt, they became Russia, just so you do understand, okay? The last thing that Russia wants to do is get too much involved with Afghanistan. They tried that once. It didn’t work out too well. (20:10)
And by the way, we’re largely out of Afghanistan, as you probably know. (20:21)
No, you’re wrong. No. (20:24)
Okay. Are you ready? (20:25)
We’ll be down in a very short… It’s already planned. (20:28)
Let me explain. We’ll be down in a very short period of time to 8,000, then we’re going to be down to 4,000. We’re negotiating right now. We’ve been there for 19 years. (20:38)
19 years. (20:40)
We’ll be getting out. (20:49)
We’re now- (20:51)
We’ll be at 4,000. I’ll get you the exact- (20:53)
Very soon. Very soon. (20:56)
Very soon. Yeah, very soon. (20:58)
I don’t want to tell you that. I don’t want to tell you. (21:01)
What is? That is [crosstalk 00:21:02] (21:03)
I’ve always said- (21:06)
We will get largely out- (21:12)
Probably anywhere from four to 5,000. (21:17)
No, it’s not. We had- (21:19)
We had much more. We had a lot of people over there too. (21:22)
A lot of people. And we did a good job. We wiped out ISIS. Let me just tell you what you don’t see. (21:26)
We took out, in Syria, we took out ISIS. We a hundred percent of the caliphate. When I took over Obama, it was totally rampant. ISIS was all over the place. We took them out. We captured them. We killed them a hundred percent, not 99%. I wanted to get out at 99. Everyone said, “Oh, please, would you stay?” I stayed. 99% was good, but a hundred percent of the caliphate.(21:52)
We took out Soleimani. We took out al-Baghdadi. We took out people that nobody thought possible. Al-Baghdadi was the biggest terrorist of them all. They couldn’t find him. I took him out. Soleimani, even bigger. I took him out. I’ve done things that no other president’s done. None. I mean, fortunately, not too many. They should have never been in the Middle East. The decision to go to the Middle East and get into the Middle East was the single biggest mistake made in the history of our country. That’s my opinion. (22:36)
Well, Hillary Clinton never accepted them. (22:39)
I mean, she doesn’t accept them and she got beaten very easily. (22:45)
Grumbled? Grumbled? She wrote books about it. (22:47)
And don’t use the word grumbled. (22:48)
She wrote books about it. (22:50)
She got beaten easy. (22:52)
306 to 223. That’s a lot. That’s a lot. (23:03)
I’ll tell you what it looks like. (23:05)
Let me tell you what it looks. (23:07)
So we have a new phenomena. It’s called mail-in voting, where you send, where a governor- (23:13)
Well, it’s new- (23:15)
In terms of kind of the kind of millions and millions of ballots. They’ve never done anything like that. (23:23)
Bigger? Not bigger, massively bigger. (23:26)
So they’re going to send tens of millions of ballots to California, all over the place, to who’s going to get them. I have a friend who lives in Westchester County- (23:35)
His son passed away. He had a beautiful, wonderful son. Young man. Passed away seven years ago. He called me, he said, “I just got a ballot for my son, Robert.” (23:46)
“He died seven years ago.” Somebody got at ballot for a dog. Somebody got a ballot for something else. You got millions of ballots going, nobody even knows where they’re going. You look at some of the corruption having to do with universal mail-in voting… Absentee voting is okay. You have to apply, you have to go through a process. (24:05)
Absentee voting is good. Look, you’re sending it out- (24:08)
Jonathan, they’re sending out- (24:12)
Governors, millions of ballots. There is- (24:16)
There is no way you can go through a mail-in vote without massive cheating. (24:24)
Go ahead. (24:33)
Correct. (24:40)
Let me tell you. We have no choice. (24:43)
Let me tell you. You ready? (24:45)
We have no choice because right now, we have, but we have many court cases that we’re waiting. We have one filed in Western Pennsylvania. We have many court cases where we’re trying to end it. We went through World War I, you went to the polls, you voted, we went through World War II, you went to the polls, you voted. (25:02)
And now because of the China virus, we’re supposed to stay home, send millions of ballots all over the country, millions and millions. You know, you could have a case where this election won’t be decided on the evening of November 3rd. (25:16)
This election could be decided two months later, (25:20)
It could be decided many months later. (25:23)
You know why? Because lots of things will happen during that period of time. Especially when you have tight margins, lots of things can happen. There’s never been anything like this when you try… Now, of course, right now, we have to live with it, but we’re challenging it in many courts, as you know, all over the country. (25:59)
Well, first of all, I don’t know that, but I do know this- (26:02)
Her friend or boyfriend- (26:05)
Was either killed or committed suicide in jail. She’s now in jail. Yeah, I wish you well, I’d wish you well, I’d wish a lot of people well. Good luck. Let them prove somebody was guilty. I mean, you do know that she [crosstalk 00:26:17] (26:20)
Well, her boyfriend died in jail and people are still trying to figure out how did it happened? Was it suicide? Was he killed? And I do wish her well. I’m not looking for anything bad for her. I’m not looking bad for anybody. And they took that and made it such a big deal- (26:35)
But all it is is her boyfriend died. He died in jail. Was he killed? Was it suicide? I do, I wish her well. (26:53)
No, no, no, no, no, no. No. No. (26:55)
here you go, the fake news. (26:58)
No, no. (26:59)
For 59 days, these people were anarchists and agitators, and some protesters, but these were anarchists. These people were beating the hell out of the city. They were beating up our federal buildings and our federal courthouse. We told the police to stop it. You make sure. And the police wouldn’t do it. Not the police- (27:19)
Excuse me. (27:23)
You’re trying now to blame law enforcement instead of anarchists- (27:27)
Instead of Antifa. (27:29)
It’s Antifa and anarchists that are causing the problems, not law enforcement. Our law enforcement, if we didn’t have people at our courthouse, and they’re strong, tough people, and they don’t want… They try and be very good, believe me. But if we didn’t have people there, you would have your federal courthouse, a $600 million building, you would have that thing burned to the ground right now. (27:55)
Okay, let me tell you about unmarked. (27:57)
Well let me tell you about unmarked. (28:16)
First of all, these are Homeland Security people. They’re securing a courthouse. (28:22)
They’re Homeland Security. (28:24)
Border, hopefully they have ICE in there. (28:26)
Hopefully they have ICE. Now, do you know why they’re unmarked? (28:30)
Because these terrorists, these Antifa people, these people that are at anarchists and agitators, when they see the name on a uniform of a person, a policeman or a law enforcement person, they find out where that person lives. And then they go and they scare the hell out of the person’s family. And so they do it for that reason. It’s just common… There’s nothing secret about this. And you know it.(28:54)
You see what’s going on right now. We have Chad Wolf. They have people. He’s doing a fantastic job. He’s the acting head. He’s doing a fantastic job. Chad Wolf has pickets and very dangerous looking people outside of his house. He’s going to be just fine. He’s tough and he’s got people, but if you have the names on all of these uniforms, you’ll have these maniacs in front of their houses, scaring their family and their wives or husbands, whatever it may be. I think it’s a very good reason not to have your name. Why should you have identification? “My name is Bill Smith and here’s where I live and I’m a member of-” (29:34)
No, no, that’s a serious concern. (29:42)
Why? Why are they being detained? (29:45)
You know why? You know why they’re being detained? Well, [crosstalk 00:29:47]. (29:50)
Well, I haven’t seen the result yet. Let me see the result. (29:54)
No, I think that actually- (29:56)
I think Antifa should be investigated, not the law enforcement. They’re investigating, think of [crosstalk 00:30:01] (30:02)
Have you been watching television-(30:03)
They’re investigating- (30:03)
Have you been watching television? (30:04)
Have you been seeing the violence? (30:06)
Now, if you watch NBC News like I watch NBC fake news. I’m watching it. Lester Holt, real beauty. I’m watching this NBC News sham, and you have a mayor named Wheeler and he’s standing out there and he’s being accosted by the people. You know that. I mean, it’s horrible what they’re doing to him in Portland, the mayor of Portland and he thought he’d go out. He’d be a man.(30:29)
What they were doing and saying, and everything else to him, I happened to watch it on a different station. He had to get out. He had five security guards. (30:36)
He got out with his life. Okay. (30:38)
Wait. If you watch NBC News, they make them like he’s standing there bravely fighting with the people, in a positive sense, that everything is wonderful.(30:48)
No. He went out there. He’s lucky he got away with his life because they would’ve killed him. He had five guards, but NBC News showed it like he’s standing with the people for justice. Look, those people, take a look at what they’ve done to the courthouse. Take a look at what they’ve done to the streets. Take a look at the violence. (31:09)
Actually, it’s getting better. We had a very good… We’ve arrested a lot of people and we now have a 10 year rule. You try not to knock down our courthouse- (31:17)
You touch our courthouse, you go to jail for 10 years. (31:25)
These are Democrat-run cities. (31:28)
And they’re doing it for political reasons. (31:32)
I have. (31:35)
Criminal justice reform, opportunity. (31:46)
Well, Black Lives Matter started off to me very badly because it was- (31:52)
… pigs in a blanket, burn them like bacon. That was the first time I ever of Black… That was three, four years ago. Pigs meaning policemen. Pigs is what they’re referring to, in a blanket, fry them like bacon. So I got off to a bad start. I got off to a very bad start. (32:11)
And so did [crosstalk 00:32:12]. (32:13)
I would. But I think right now when they paint- (32:17)
… the sign. Nobody’s asked for a meeting, right? I’ve never been, nobody’s ever asked me for a meeting. Let me tell you with African Americans, I’m doing very well. They had the best employment numbers they’ve ever had. They had the best job numbers they’ve ever had. They were making more money than they ever made. We were all set until we got hit by China with the virus. Jonathan, there was actually, we were becoming a very unified country. (32:40)
Because of success. (32:48)
Well, I hope not. I hope not. Certainly the… (32:53)
The knee on the neck was a disgrace. Okay? (32:55)
It was a disgrace. (33:00)
I hope the answer to that question is no. Does anybody really answer that question accurately? Does anybody really know? (33:10)
I have seen where there is a difference and I don’t want there to be a difference. I don’t like that there would be a difference. But with that being said- (33:19)
Police have killed white people- (33:22)
… in larger number, police have killed white people. (33:29)
That I don’t know- (33:30)
… but I don’t like it. (33:33)
I don’t know why, but I don’t like it. I do know this- (33:37)
… that police have killed many white people also. (33:42)
It speaks to something, if that’s the number? (33:45)
Okay. If that’s the number, it speaks to something that to me is unacceptable. (33:51)
Well, I think we’ve already done a lot of things- (33:53)
Let me just tell you. (33:58)
I’ve done a thing called criminal justice reform. (34:01)
And your friend President Obama couldn’t get done. (34:04)
He tried, but he couldn’t get it done. I got criminal justice [crosstalk 00:34:07]- (34:07)
I got opportunities on, I took care of the historically Black… If you look at what I’ve done for colleges, for Black colleges and universities, I got them funding. Obama never did it. I did more for the Black community than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, whether you like it or not. People say, “Oh, that’s interesting.” (34:34)
I think I did, yeah. (34:36)
Because I got criminal justice reform done, I got prison reform- (34:39)
I’ve done things. Well- (34:43)
Ask. Ask. How has it worked out? If you take a look at what Lyndon Johnson did? (34:46)
How has it worked out? Because frankly, it took a long time, but for African Americans- (34:54)
… under my administration, Jonathan, under my administration, African Americans were doing better than they have ever done in the history of this country. So I did a lot, job numbers, all of it, money. They had money, they were getting great. Their percentage was up, their housing ownership was up. They did better than they’ve ever done until we got hit- (35:13)
… and now you know what we’re doing? I’m building it up again. We’re going to have it. Next year will be a great year, unless it’s screwed up by somebody that doesn’t know what he’s doing, which could happen, but I don’t think it will. (35:29)
I don’t know. I really don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know John Lewis. He chose not to come to my inauguration. He chose… I never met John Lewis, actually, I don’t believe. (35:46)
I can’t say one or the other. I find a lot of people impressive. I find many people not impressive. But no, but I didn’t go- (35:53)
He didn’t come to my inauguration. He didn’t come to my State of the Union speeches, and that’s okay. That’s his right. And again, nobody has done more- (36:03)
… for Black Americans than I have. (36:05)
He should’ve come. I think he made a big mistake by not showing up. (36:14)
He was a person that devoted a lot of energy and a lot of heart to civil rights, but there were many others also. (36:32)
I would have no objection to it if they’ve like to do it. (36:34)
Would have no objection to it whatsoever. (36:39)
Well, thank you very much. Great honor. (36:41)
Thank you.hank you.(36:46)
Thank you very much."
ttrump_rebuild_Transcript.txt,"(00:23)
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Great honor. Please, thank you. Sit down, please. It’s great to be with you. Great company and wonderful location. Quick flight. It’s in and out, but we have some big things to say. Carol, I want to thank you also for doing such an incredible job at this company. I look at your numbers and I’m very jealous. A lot of people are very jealous. But I’m delighted to be back in Atlanta, Georgia, special place. The hometown of one of the most amazing companies on earth, UPS. They never fail. The dedicated men and women of UPS are an inspiration to us all. In the face of every challenge, you always come through for your fellow citizens. Would you say that’s correct? I say it’s correct.(01:22)
Let me start by expressing my gratitude to every driver, worker, and employee who has contributed to this great success and continue to deliver for America throughout our battle against the China virus, it goes by many different names, about 21 that I can figure. We maybe we’ll use a different one every time we hit it, but whatever it is, it was a terrible thing and it could have been stopped and it should have been stopped right where it started in China. Together, we will defeat this virus and emerge stronger than ever before. We’re here today to celebrate a historic breakthrough that will transform the lives of workers and families all across our nation.(02:10)
For decades, the single biggest obstacle to building a modern transportation system has been the mountains and mountains of bureaucratic red tape in Washington, DC. Before I took off, it’s reviews for highways ballooned to an average of nearly 750 pages in length, and they were the good ones, they were the short ones. And I know because I was in business for a long time and I had to go through a process that was so ridiculous. It was so ridiculous. We went through a process for building buildings usually, it would take forever. By the time you start building, the market changed. You said, “The market was good when we started, now the market’s lousy.” So you’d say, “To hell with it. We won’t build.”(02:54)
Sometimes you’d start building and you’d say, “That was a mistake.” But we went through years and years of litigation and tumult, and it was just not good, but you’d go through it. To an even greater extent, the maze like approval process represented lobbyists that were very rich. They were making a lot of money. I remember I’d go up to Albany, New York and I’d see my lobbyists up there. I’d say, “What are you doing here?” I knew what they were doing. They were trying to make it more difficult so you had to hire them for more and more work, spend millions and millions of dollars for nothing. But too often, they caused massive delays on top of everything else. And that way they got their fees over a longer period of time.(03:37)
It’s one of the reasons why, for example, the average Atlanta driver spends an incredible 77 hours in traffic during a short period of time. But all of that ends today. We’re doing something very dramatic. We just completed an unprecedented, I don’t want to say it’s absolutely unprecedented, top to bottom overhaul should have been done years ago of the infrastructure approval process. This approval process that has cost trillions of dollars over the years for our country and delays like you wouldn’t believe. This is a truly historic breakthrough, which means better roads, bridges, tunnels, and highways for every UPS driver and every citizen all across our land.(04:29)
Together we’re reclaiming America’s proud heritage as a nation of builders and a nation that can get things done. Because with these horrible roadblocks that were put in front of us, you couldn’t get it done. No matter how good you were, you couldn’t get it done. You’d wait and wait. You’d go to the next step. You say you can’t start the next step until you finish the first. Joining us for this special occasion are Council of Environmental Quality chairman, Mary Neumayr. Where’s Mary? Mary. Thank you, Mary. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mary. Good. Secretary of transportation, a very special woman, a great woman, somebody that has done an incredible job, Elaine Chao. Elaine.(05:18)
And she was very much instrumental in getting this done. And when Elaine speaks, we all listen, but she was very much instrumental. Secretary of agriculture, a man who has done a fantastic job for our farmers and ranchers, Sonny Perdue. Sonny. I learned more about farming from Sonny Purdue than all of these consultants that came in. I learned more in a half an hour from that man right there. We had a great call today with the farmers too. Great call. They’re doing very well. A lot of good things have happened, right Sonny? A lot of things have happened. They were targeted by China. They were targeted by others. We just signed the USMCA, which is phenomenal for our country and our farmers. Got rid of one of the worst trade deals in history, NAFTA.(06:07)
One of the worst trade deals ever, how anybody could have signed it, but worse, how anybody could have let it run for 25 years or whatever it was. They just took advantage of us. We had 60,000 empty plants and factories in our country by the time that mess got finished. So we just signed a great deal, USMCA. It’s the largest trade deal ever made, Mexico, Canada, the largest ever made. I know Sonny would like me to thank the UPS, all of the drivers and workers for all of the help in delivering nearly 30 million meals to rural children throughout the country for our Meals-to-You program. Meals-to-You, you know what that is? Meals-to-You. You do, right?(06:53)
We’re also pleased to be joined by a great senator, somebody that’s done a phenomenal job. And I can tell you, look, he’s a friend of mine, so I’m a little prejudiced, but he’s a man that’s respected by everybody on both sides of the US Senate. He works hard. He loves your state. And I always say, does David get the kind of recognition that he deserves? Because he is a very, very special man. David Perdue, where is David? David, thank you. And a woman who’s come in and done a great job. And she’s been so supportive of me and the agenda, and a good person, a good woman with her husband who’s a terrific man, Senator Kelly Loeffler. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kelly. Great job, Kelly.(07:46)
And warriors, these are warriors. These people fought for us through thick and thin, through very, very unfair territory. We were treated terribly and they came in and they turned out to be tougher than the other side by a lot. And I just want to introduce representatives Rick Allen, Rick. Thanks, Rick. The great Buddy Carter. Buddy. An incredible spokesman, an incredible man and friend, Doug Collins. Doug. Thank you, Doug. Great job, Doug. Drew Ferguson. Drew. Thank you very much, Drew. Jody Hice. Jody. Thank you, Jody. Great job, Jody. And Barry Loudermilk. Barry, thank you very much. And also two people, friends of mine. They’ll be there soon in my opinion because they have to, because we need all the help we can get in Washington.(08:45)
Karen Handel. Karen, thank you very much. Thank you, Karen. And Rich McCormick. Rich, thank you. They’ll be there soon I hope. I hope. We need them. We need them. Get them in there. Thank you as well to a man who I became very good friends with, a man who was running against somebody that was unbeatable, running against a superstar. I said, “Oh, she’s a superstar. Wow.” Can you beat superstars? I don’t think so, but he figured out how to be a superstar. And I don’t know if she’s still a superstar, Brian. I’m not sure. I’m not sure. I don’t think so. I don’t know. Superstars don’t lose. Do they? Governor Brian Kemp. I’ll tell you, what a warrior he is. He’s tough. He’s tough and he’s done a great job.(09:40)
You’ve done a great job in every aspect of running this incredible state. And I’ve always been there for you. He was saying when we met at the plane, “Everything we’ve needed in Georgia, you’ve been there for,” and that’s right. That’s right. Perhaps more important than Brian, however, right? Far more important is Georgia first lady, Marty Kemp. Thank you very much, Marty. And watch please those mail-in ballots. You’re going to watch that for me because they have a lot of problems all over the country. They just had Paterson, New Jersey where massive percentages of the vote was a fraud. Mail-in ballots, be careful. Be careful. They would understand because they deliver.(10:24)
In fact, I’m going to have to be very nice to UPS. UPS, I love you, Carol, wherever you are, Carol. I love you, Carol. Now it’s very bad what’s going on with mail-in ballots. Okay? As differentiated from absentee ballots where you have to go and you go through a process because you can’t be there for some reason, but the mail-in ballots is going to be, they’re going to be rigged. They’re going to be a terrible situation. And you have to be careful in Georgia, but you have to be careful everywhere where they’re doing it. We went through a First World War and a Second World War and people went to vote. Now they’re saying, “Let’s use this-”(11:03)
Or people went to vote. Now they’re saying let’s use this as a chance not to vote. And there’s been tremendous corruption, tremendous corruption on mail-in ballots. So absentee ballot, great, mail-in ballot, absolutely no good. It makes no sense. A governor sends out millions of ballots all over the place. They don’t know where they’re going. They’re going to wherever. I have a friend who got one for his daughter, another one for his daughter, and then a second one for the first daughter. They didn’t know what to do with them. I had another friend, a really wonderful guy who lost his son seven years ago, Robert, his son, Robert, and his son was sent a mail-in ballot. He called me, he said, “What do I do? I just got a mail-in ballot for Robert? Robert died seven years ago.” So it’s a terrible situation if they decide to use it. And we’ll see what happens. There’s a lot of litigation, a lot of court cases right now.(11:57)
And it makes sense. Just think of it. Millions of ballots. In California, they’re sending out millions of ballots. They don’t even know who. Maybe they know too well who they’re sending them to. And maybe it’s the people that don’t get it. Maybe it’s an area of Republicans or Democrats that don’t happen to get any ballots. We’ve had a lot of problems. Just take a look at what’s gone on over the last month and take a look at Patterson, New Jersey. Small city in New Jersey. I think they said something like 20% of the ballots were corrupted or something happened with them. 20%. And even in the 2016 election, 1% are in question. But I don’t want to talk about that one because I won. So I don’t want anyone going back and looking, all right? I’m not going to talk about 2016. That was the greatest election.(12:45)
And now we have to do something very important. We have to keep it going or this country will be in big, big trouble. I want to thank also for being here, Georgia Attorney General, Chris Carr. You’re the one Chris. Watch that Chris, will you? Williams. You’re going to watch that, Chris, please, okay? You got to speak to the man that handles it. You know what I’m talking about. You got to do it. Thank you, Chris. It’s in good hands. Superintendent Richard Woods. Richard, thank you very much. Thank you. And members of the Georgia Public Service Commission and the State Senate and House Transportation Committee. We’ve got a lot of politicians in this room. And really good luck to Karen and to Rich. Go out and go get them. You’re great people. Today’s action is part of my administration’s fierce commitment to slashing the web of needless bureaucracy that is holding back our citizens. I’ve been wanting to do this from day one. Then we started on day one, literally on day one, but it takes a long time. You have statutory requirements. You have a lot of different roadblocks, even to changing it. But the change you’ll be hearing about in a minute, and it’s one of the biggest things we can be doing for our country. The last administration increased the Federal Register by 16,000 pages of job-killing regulations. Under my administration, we have cut the Federal Register by nearly 25,000 pages, more than any president in history, whether it’s four years, eight years or one case more.(14:17)
And we, frankly, this I would think is maybe the biggest of all. We did the U.S. Waters. You saw that? The U.S. Waters Act? That was a big one. That was a big one. I thought I was going to take a lot of heat when I did that, and instead, it was just the opposite. People came up, grown men that had never cried even when they were a baby, they were standing behind me when I signed that bill at the White House, and they were crying. They were crying because we gave their life back to them. That took their life away. It took their livelihood away. It was a big, big moment, but this is a big moment today, too. Probably, possibly equally as big.(14:56)
Today’s action completely modernizes the environmental review process under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. We are cutting the federal permitting timeline from a staggering 10 years, 15 years, 18 years, 21 years. You know the story. You’ve seen it. Projects that start out, a young guy heads the project. By the time it gets approved or disapproved, in many cases, disapproved, usually disapproved, he’s getting ready to retire. Say, “What do you do for your life?” “I worked on one project. We didn’t get it through in the end.” Now we won’t get certain projects through for environmental reasons. They have to be environmentally sound, but you know what? We’re going to know in a year. We’re going to know in a year and a half. We’re not going to know in 20 years.(15:46)
So we’re cutting the federal permitting timeline for a major project from up to 20 years or more, hard to believe, down to two years or less. So we have it down to about two years right now, Elaine, and I think two years or less, and our goal is one year. And you may get disapproved. They may vote at the end. They didn’t like something environmentally or safety-wise, and I’m all for that. But you’re not going to devote a lifetime to doing a project that doesn’t get approved or that gets approved. And oftentimes when it gets approved, it comes in at 10, 20, 30 times the cost.(16:24)
There’s a highway in a certain state, short road, not even a highway, I guess, more of a roadway. And they put it in, it was a straight line from point to point. By the time they finished it 18 years later, it was this. It cost tens of times, it cost many, many, many times more than the original. It’s a dangerous roadway because there’s turns. You got to be in good shape. You got to be wide awake to make those turns. You got to see those things. You have to see the guard rails, boom. They had a simple straight roadway and now they build it and they end up… It took 17 years to get it approved. Ended up costing many, many times what the original estimates were, and it’s no good. It’s not good.(17:08)
Under the last administration, a mere 7% of reviews for federal highways were processed within two years. Now what we’re doing is, the two years won’t be the exception, it will be the rule. So what we’re doing is we’re going to have that coming down at a much steeper rate. This will reduce approval times for highways alone by at least 70%. But the 70% is a very unambitious number because the number’s going to be actually much lower than that. At the heart of the reforms is the One Federal Decision Policy. It really spells it out when you hear that name. One Federal Decision. Before, applicants for infrastructure permits were forced to spend years and years navigating a labyrinth of federal agencies, and every single one had the power to stop a project.(18:04)
Anytime you went to an agency, they had a power to stop it. And it would stop the project. Not only stop it, right in its tracks, it would stop it. With our reforms, it would be one quick and fair decision. We’re going to give every project a clear answer, yes or no. Yes or no. The two-year process where just to submit is two years is not acceptable. It’s going to be a very quick yes or no after study, but the studies are going to go quickly, and they’re going to go simultaneously.(18:37)
So if you’re in numerous agencies, you’re all going at the same time instead of waiting for one, for two, for three. And oftentimes you’d go through one, it would take you six months, and then you have to wait 90 days, and then you have a review period, and then you start the second one. And now you go for another four months, and then you wait 90 days, and you have a review period. And sometimes you had to go through nine, 10, 12 different agencies. So even if you did absolute rapid, it was many, many years before you could even think about starting it.(19:10)
We have up here, by the way, that’s a chart of the old system and the new system. And I think the new system is better. I think it’s better not only in time. I think it’s better in terms of the process. And I think it’s better in terms of the importance from an environmental and a safety standpoint. But take a look at that. This is what you had to go through. In fact, it was much more dramatic when I first came up with this about a year ago. We took that and we rolled it out. It was so dramatic, and it just kept going and going. So the difference is that, and many of those steps you had to wait before you could even think about going to the next one, and you had to get full approvals. Any one of those colors, where there was a problem or a rejection, meant it was dead. And now you go through this very simple but very comprehensive solution. That’s a beautiful thing. Especially if you understand construction and building and other things beyond building like I do.(20:14)
At the same time, we’ll maintain America’s Gold Standard Environmental Protections. The United States will continue to have among the very cleanest air and cleanest water on earth, which we do now. We have the cleanest that we’ve ever had, ever meaning, I guess, in the last 40 years. I assume that 200 years ago was cleaner. I can imagine it was very clean a couple of hundred years ago, Brian, right?(20:37)
That’s why I’m very careful with the fake news media, because if I say that, “We have the cleanest water we’ve ever had,” they said, “What about 200 years ago before anybody touched the lake? When the Lake was a beautiful virgin lake. Nobody ever touched it.” They said, “Yeah, they got me on that one,” don’t they, huh? So now I’ve become extremely careful. So I say probably they’re talking about 35, 40 years, something like that. If it’s any different from that, media, we will… Look at all those people back there. Any different than that, we will report to you. We will make an amendment. We’ll never make a correction because I don’t like doing that.(21:16)
One of the first projects accelerated by these reforms will be the planned expansion of I-75 right here in Georgia. That’s in honor of your wife, in honor of Marty. Okay? That’s in honor of Marty. They’ve been looking to do that for many years, right? But the governor is going to get it done. This expansion will add 77 new lane miles of commercial vehicles like those driven by UPS, saving drivers countless hundreds of hours a year. With us today is Julian [Palk 00:22:03], a teamster, I know the teamsters very well, at UPS who drives this route often. Julian, please come up and tell your story, please. Thank you.(22:07)
Thanks, Julian.(22:13)
Good afternoon. Hi, my name is Julian Polk. It’s a great honor to be in front of you. I’m especially grateful for my wife being here with me today of 14 years. I spent the first 16 years of my career driving a package car going from house to house. But in my last three years, I’ve been in the big rigs, mostly on 75. And throughout 75, we have approximately 765 trucks in Metro, Atlanta. 64 of those travel from McDonough to Macon, Georgia, which is about a hundred miles round trip. With the congestion and all of that, it kind of makes it to where it’s hard to get there and create all the time commits. Every time I’ve loaded my truck, whether it was medical equipment, a gift to someone’s loved one, that time in transit was very important.(23:12)
With this infrastructure, it’s very important to me and all of my fellow UPSers because the investment in our roads and bridges help reduce congestion and open up the bottlenecks, which makes it easier to get the packages to where they need to go. More importantly, safe for drivers like myself, because we all know the most important stop of the day is when I get back home to her and my two beautiful kids. Thank you. 14 years ago at my local hub in Forest Park, with the support of my management team, I started the corporate health and safety process. Throughout that team, we were able to lower the accidents and injuries, which we know accidents on the road slows down time in transit. Since then, we’ve stopped all of that or most of it. I’d like to close by saying thank you to my wife for being here, to everyone that has supported me, especially my division manager, Tom Rosilio. He has supported me in my career and for the great opportunity to be here today.(24:22)
Fantastic job. Thank you, Julian. But Julian, it looks like you’re attributing a lot of your success to your wife. Is that a correct statement?(24:32)
Absolutely.(24:32)
Would you please stand up? So lovely. Thank you. That’s great. Great job. You’re proud of the job he just did, I think. Huh? Pretty good. He’ll be running for office next week. Watch. Great job, Julian. Thank you. I’d like to invite UPS’ vice president of corporate transportation, Bill Taylor, up to say a few words. Please, Bill.(25:07)
Thank you, Bill. Thank you very much.(25:10)
Good afternoon. Now, thank you for visiting the UPS gateway President Trump. Thank you very much. I am so proud to be a 37 year veteran of this great company. I started my UPS career as a part time hourly employee when I was still in school, back in 1983. When I graduated from college, I went into management and throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work in our airline, in our freight transportation operations, and also in our package delivery operations throughout the United States. I’m now preparing to retire. When I think about UPS, all of us at UPS and is a great example. All of us that UPS worked through some very tough times through our careers, whether it’s hurricanes and natural disasters or some type of national event like 9/11, and now COVID-19, but all of us that UPS also look at that as a great opportunity to serve this great country and help bring the country through and remedy those tough situations.(26:10)
You look at project Airbridge under the Trump administration and working directly with FEMA. Another great example. From a UPS standpoint, we are all tremendously proud to help deliver life saving supplies, wherever and whenever they are needed. From an infrastructure standpoint, I know firsthand that improvements in our infrastructure will be a tremendous benefit to not only our customers, but also the communities that we serve. But when I think about UPS, I know how strong our technology is. I know how strong our flexible multimodal transportation network is. And I know all UPSers are dedicated to making a difference and helping bring America forward. As I think about the ending my career, I am very grateful to retire with a strong pension plan. I hope the same for all essential workers who have a pension plan currently hung up, that they can enjoy the same when their work is over. Thank you, UPS for a wonderful career and the great opportunity to work with so many wonderful people through the years to help make a difference. Thank you.(27:24)
Thank you very much, Bill and good luck. Carol, I don’t think I’d let him retire. He’s got about 30 years left in him at UPS. Can’t believe you’re retiring. That’s terrible. You want to retire or do you want to stay because they’ll renew you for 25 years. You’ve got it. You’ve done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. Thank you, Bill. Really great job. Here as well as the commissioner of Georgia Department of Transportation, Russell McMurry. Russell, please come up and say a few words. Thank you.ry: (28:03)
Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, it was an honor for me to meet with you in Washington, DC at the USDOT with Secretary Elaine Chao and some other state DOT commissioners from around the nation. For us to share with you this long burdensome, often bureaucratic process and you sat and listened to us with great detail that day. At the end of that meeting, too, I might add that the President told us, the DOT commissioners there in the room that he was going to streamline the environmental process, cut the red tape and make sure that the environment is protected, number one. Today is a full circle day for me, Mr. President, that here we are today with the President and the Trump administration rolling out yet another, not the first, but another environmental process improvement that will make life much easier for people like us at the Department’s of Transportation’s across the nation to deliver infrastructure projects like the I-75 commercial vehicle lanes to move that freight out of Savannah to Atlanta and beyond, while providing a safe corridor for the many families that travel on I-75.ry: (29:18)
Now, I certainly want to acknowledge someone else that is laser focused on streamlining government and cutting red tape and that’s our governor, Brian Kemp. Governor, I appreciate your focus to transportation and infrastructure. It certainly makes my life a lot easier so thank you. Now, finally, I’d just like to recognize somebody else and the President acknowledged her earlier, but the leadership exemplified by Secretary Elaine Chao at the USDOT is exceptional. We have never experienced the kind of cooperation … We at the Georgia’s DOT has never experienced this type of cooperation from your administration, Mr. President, that we enjoyed today. Thank you for your leadership and thank you for the partnership you share, not only with Georgia, but all the states. Mr. President, thank you for making this happen. Thank you.(30:17)
And Russell said that so well because there have been many steps that we’ve made over the course of the last three years that allowed us to get to this big, giant step. This is a big deal, and this is front page all over this country. Frankly, nobody realizes what it means other than the people that are in this room and others that do what you do, but the fact is, this is something that nobody thought was possible. But it was all those little steps, Russell, that allowed us to get to this step bureaucratically and then every other way. Thank you very much and you’ve done a great job. Appreciate it. We’re also joined by Janell King, a small business owner here in Atlanta. Janell, please come up and say a few words, please.(31:03)
Thank you. Thank you very much.(31:13)
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Governor Kemp. And thank you UPS for delivering all my shoes on time. I am Janell King. Together, my husband Kelvin King, and I he’s the one that really goes through all of this. I serve as VP of External Affairs with Osprey Management, which is such an honor. We have 10 employees, by which one of them received their United States citizenship this morning, so that’s awesome. We have over 150 subcontractors and we have a number of projects that are taking place throughout the state. Our ability to harness opportunities and supply our clients with on time projects promptly is extremely important. Several have proposed fantastic ideas and aid to developing new forms of commuting. Red tape and restrictions in place have hindered these ideas and due to extensive permitting and impact studies that increase timelines.(32:15)
Well, Mr. President, you have shown what leadership can do when you reform the old way of doing things. Infrastructure reform and building new roads faster will not only help our company to achieve our project goals, but they will help the entire state, both economically and socially. I would like to personally thank you for placing the needs of the constituents in the forefront of your list and addressing our infrastructure concerns and our governor and first lady for working along with you until we can get this done and to our senators; Senator David Perdue and Senator Kelly Leffler for always being available as well. Thank you so much.(32:51)
Thank you very much. Great job. Great job. And look how proud your husband is of you. He had that camera up. That camera wasn’t moving down, I’ll tell you. He captured every word…(33:03)
Camera up, that camera wasn’t moving down, I tell you. He captured every word. That’s great. Beautiful family. Thank you very much. One of the things I’ll tell you that the Governor and I are working on, a couple of projects that are going to be big surprises for you, big ones, big projects that you’ve been talking about for 20 years I guess in one case. So we’ll get them done. I’m sure we’ll get them done. And I want to thank you all. Great presentations. Thank you all very much.(33:26)
My administration is also moving full speed ahead on improving the Port of Savannah, which is now the largest agriculture exporting port in the entire United States, largest in the country. As many of you know, this project faced 20 years of unnecessary delays. This has been going on for years. When they came to me and the Governor said, “Can you help us with this? I said, “We’ll help you with it. What’s the story?” It’s been going on for years and years. They’ve been talking about it. Nothing ever happened. It was also eight years of additional bureaucratic reviews, just reviews. This isn’t like, “Oh, gee, let’s start digging.” This is paperwork. People made a lot of money. It’s a terrible thing. It just gets caught up like so many other places. But it’s all ending now.(34:11)
Bureaucratic reviews under the Obama-Biden administration have been a disaster. And they got worse. But I’m proud to report that for three straight years under my administration, we’ve delivered full funding for the Port of Savannah and we’re on track to complete the project in a very short period of time. It’s going to be complete. In honor of the Governor. In honor of the Governor and Marty. Good. Congratulations. That was a great job. They’ve been fighting for that one for a long time. You got it done. We want a governor that gets it done. Even though he calls me all the time, “Can we get it done?” I wish he wouldn’t call so much. But you know, that’s the sign of a good governor, right? When you think, right? Stand up, please. That’s a sign of a governor. I like the ones that don’t call, Brian, where they just leave me alone. But their project never happens. Great job you do, great job.(35:09)
We want the United States to compete and win in the 21st century. And that means we will not allow our nation to be hamstrung by wasteful Washington regulations. We’re the nation that built the Golden Gate Bridge in four years, the Hoover Dam in five years. And a lot of people don’t understand this, but it’s so true, we built the Empire State Building and less than a year. Can you imagine that? The Biden administration, our past vice president, opposes, think of this, all of our permitting reforms, and wants to increase the length of the permitting process. Think of this, this is in his Bernie Sanders deal. Biden is happy to tie up projects in red tape, and we want to get things built. But they want to increase the length. So they want to increase it from that to much longer. Unbelievable.(36:02)
Biden wants to massively re-regulate the energy economy, rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, which would kill our energy totally. And you’d have to close 25% of your businesses and kill oil and gas development. They still haven’t explained what they’re going to do to power our great plants and factories. But at some point, I’m sure they will. We’ll learn that from AOC, who’s in charge of energy. She’s in charge, along with Bernie. It’s AOC and Bernie are in charge of energy. I don’t think Texas is too happy about that. What do you think? You think we’ll call up the governor, Governor Abbott, great governor. We’ll ask, “How do you like that Governor?” I didn’t want to waste the phone call because I would know how he felt.(36:46)
And Biden wants to hold hostage billions in federal surface transportation grants for states and localities, unless the states and local suburban communities abolish single family zoning rules. So they want low income housing to be built in communities that frankly, they don’t want it. They don’t want it. Hasn’t worked out. And we’re terminating that as you know. I announced it two weeks ago. We’re going to be eliminating that rule. It’s a crazy rule and it’s very unfair to a lot of people. A lot of people are very unhappy.(37:19)
It should not take 10 years or more just to get approval for a simple stretch of road. Special interests in Washington will never begin, they will never begin to let you breathe. That’s not their business. Their business is the opposite. And we will do vetoes wherever necessary in order to make sure everything happens and happens quickly. We’re not giving a veto for one thing, America’s future. There will never be a veto for America’s future. So my goal, my mission, and my commitment to each of you is very simple. America’s infrastructure will be the envy of the entire world as it was many, many years ago. We built the interstate highway system during the Eisenhower administration, a long time ago. And since then it’s gotten worse and worse and worse and more bureaucratic and more bureaucratic. And now we’re freeing up and we’re going back probably to around 1952. We’re going back to a long time ago. And again, you do have to get permits. We want safety. We want to be totally involved with the environment. We want our environment to be better than it would be the other way, the long way. But you’re going to get your answers quickly. One way or the other, you’re going to get those answers very quickly. And if the answer is a big, beautiful, yes, you’re going to start construction immediately. You’re not going to wait around for 10, 12, and 20 years.(38:47)
Our bridges, tunnels, freeways, and airports will no longer be the site of shame, but they’ll be a source of pride. From coast to coast, town to town, we’re constructing new roads, railways, runways, and waterways. You know, we had many cases where they’ll get federal funding to build a highway, then it’ll take them forever to get the approval. And by the time they have it approved, they need 10 times more money. They come back to the federal government. And the government would usually turn them down. They’d say that wasn’t the deal. But sometimes they’d just paid 10 times more. We’re not going to do that anymore.(39:22)
We’re linking our cities with gleaming highways and blazing fast broadwalk. And if you think, when you look at the farmers of this country, what they’ve gone through with the broadband, broadband is so bad in the middle section, that beautiful middle section of our country, our farmers, our ranches are hurt very badly. So we’re getting fast broadband networks, and we’re carving them out, and towering, beautiful new monuments to American greatness. And that’s what they will be. But our farmers have to be thought of also. Nobody thought of our farmers. Our farmers are incredible and they’re doing an incredible job, doing an incredible job. So for the farmers out there, broadband, here we come. Broadband, they’ve been trying to get it for a long time, many years.(40:13)
Together, we’re building our incredible future with American hands, American heart, and American steel. As your president, I’m more determined than ever that America’s infrastructure will be second to none. And in Georgia, you’re going to have an infrastructure and you’re going to have some projects announced that almost all of the people in this room do not know about. Most people have given up on them, Brian. I think they’ve given up, they gave up with the rest of them. But we have some things planned in Georgia that’ll be really incredible. And everybody’s going to want it. Both Democrat, by the way, and Republican. The problem is nobody was able to get it done. We get it done. One thing I know, I know how to get things done.(40:59)
And under this administration, we will always put America first. We were putting other countries first. Now we’re putting America first. So I want to thank everybody for being here. I want to thank and congratulate UPS on having a great run, many years, but a great run recently. You’ve done a fantastic job, whether it’s Sky Bridge or anything else that we’ve done with you, you’ve been fantastic. I really appreciate it. But especially I appreciate a state called Georgia. It’s a special place. It’s a great place. And it’s an honor to be with you. And it’s an honor, this is where I’m announcing, this is good for the whole country. Not only Georgia, this is for the whole country, but I’m announcing it in Georgia because we have some great things planned for you. You are special people. Mr. Governor, thank you very much. Marty, thank you very much. Everybody, thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you very much, everybody. Have a good time."

 THE PRESIDENT,  Well, thank you very much and thank you, Jeanne.  It is my profound honor to be the first President in history to attend the March for Life.  (Applause.)  We’re here for a very simple reason, to defend the right of every child, born and unborn, to fulfill their God-given potential.  (Applause.)
 
 For 47 years, Americans of all backgrounds have traveled from across the country to stand for life.  And today, as President of the United States, I am truly proud to stand with you.  (Applause.)
 
 I want to welcome tens of thousands — this is a tremendous turnout — tens of thousands of high school and college students who took long bus rides — (applause) — to be here in our nation’s capital.  And to make you feel even better, there are tens of thousands of people outside that we passed on the way in.  If anyone would like to give up their spot, we can work that out.  (Laughter.)  You have a tremendous group of people outside.  Thousands and thousands wanted to get in.  This is some great success.  (Applause.)  Young people are the heart of the March for Life, and it’s your generation that is making America the pro-family, pro-life nation.  (Applause.)
 
 The life movement is led by strong women, amazing faith leaders, and brave students who carry on the legacy of pioneers before us who fought to raise the conscience of our nation and uphold the rights of our citizens.  You embrace mothers with care and compassion.  You are powered by prayer, and motivated by pure, unselfish love.
 
 You’re grateful — and we are so grateful — these are incredible people — to be joined by Secretary Alex Azar and Kellyanne Conway.  (Applause.)  Thank you.
 
 And thanks also to Senators Mike Lee and James Lankford, who are here.  James, Mike — thank you, fellas.  And Representatives Steve Scalise — (applause); Chris Smith — (applause); Ralph Abraham — (applause); Warren Davidson — (applause); Bob Latta — (applause); John Joyce — (applause); Lloyd Smucker — (applause);  Brian Fitzpatrick — (applause); and Brad Wenstrup.  (Applause.)  Thank you, all.  (Applause.)
 
 And I have to say — and I look at it — I see it exactly — we have many, many more politicians in the audience.  But, if you don’t mind, I won’t introduce them all.  (Laughter.)
 
 All of us here today understand an eternal truth, Every child is a precious and sacred gift from God.  (Applause.)  Together, we must protect, cherish, and defend the dignity and sanctity of every human life.  (Applause.)
 
 When we see the image of a baby in the womb, we glimpse the majesty of God’s creation.  (Applause.)  When we hold a newborn in our arms, we know the endless love that each child brings to a family.  When we watch a child grow, we see the splendor that radiates from each human soul.  One life changes the world.  From my family — and I can tell you, I send love and I send great, great love.
 
 And from the first day in office, I’ve taken a historic action to support America’s families and to protect the unborn.  (Applause.)  And during my first week in office, I reinstated and expanded the Mexico City Policy, and we issued a landmark pro-life rule to govern the use of Title X taxpayer funding.  (Applause.)
 
 I notified Congress that I would veto any legislation that weakens pro-life policies or that encourages the destruction of human life.  (Applause.)
 
 At the United Nations, I made clear that global bureaucrats have no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that protect innocent life.  (Applause.)
 
 Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.  (Applause.)  And as the Bible tells us, each person is “wonderfully made.”  (Applause.)
 
 We have taken decisive action to protect the religious liberty –- so important.  Religious liberty has been under attack all over the world, and, frankly, very strongly attacked in our nation.  You see it better than anyone.  But we are stopping it, and we’re taking care of doctors, nurses, teachers, and groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor.  (Applause.)  We are preserving faith-based adoption.  (Applause.)
 
 And to uphold our founding documents, we have confirmed 187 federal judges — (applause) — who apply the Constitution as written, including two phenomenal Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.  (Applause.)
 
 We are protecting pro-life students’ right to free speech on college campuses.  (Applause.)  And if universities want federal taxpayer dollars, then they must uphold your First Amendment right to speak your mind.  And if they don’t, they pay a very big financial penalty, which they will not be willing to pay.  (Applause.)
 
 Sadly, the far-left is actively working to erase our God-given rights, shut down faith-based charities, ban religious believers from the public square, and silence Americans who believe in the sanctity of life.  They are coming after me because I am fighting for you and we are fighting for those who have no voice.  And we will win because we know how to win.  (Applause.)  We all know how to win.  We all know how to win.  You’ve been winning for a long time.  You’ve been winning for a long time.  (Applause.)
 
 AUDIENCE, Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!
 
 THE PRESIDENT,  Together, we are the voice for the voiceless.  When it comes to abortion, Democrats is a — and you know this, you’ve seen what’s happened — Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions taken and seen in this country for years, and decades — and you can even say “for centuries.”
 
 AUDIENCE,  Booo —
 
 THE PRESIDENT,  Nearly every top Democrat in Congress now supports taxpayer-funded abortion, all the way up until the moment of birth.
 
 AUDIENCE,  Booo —
 
 THE PRESIDENT,  Last year, lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb right up until delivery.
 
 AUDIENCE,  Booo —
 
 THE PRESIDENT,  Then, we had the case of the Democrat governor in the state of Virginia — the Commonwealth of Virginia.
 
 AUDIENCE,  Booo —
 
 THE PRESIDENT,  And we love the Commonwealth of Virginia, but what is going on in Virginia?  What is going on?  The Governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth.  You remember that.
 
 Senate Democrats even blocked legislation that would give medical care to babies who survive attempted abortions.  That’s why I’ve called on Congress — two of our great senators here, so many of our congressmen here — and called upon them to defend the dignity of life and to pass legislation prohibiting  late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in their mother’s womb.  (Applause.)
 
 This year, the March for Life is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which forever enshrined women’s rights to vote in the United States — (applause) — and given by the United States Constitution.  Such a big event.  (Applause.)
 
 Today, millions of extraordinary women across America are using the power of their votes to fight for the right, and all of their rights, as given in the Declaration of Independence –- it’s the right to life. To all the women here today, Your devotion and your leadership uplifts our entire nation, and we thank you for that.
 
 The tens of thousands of Americans gathered today not only stand for life — it’s really that they stand for it so proudly together, and I want to thank everybody for that.
 
 You stand for life each and every day.  You provide housing, education, jobs, and medical care to the women that you serve.  You find loving families for children in need of a forever home.  You host baby showers for expecting moms.  You make –- you just make it your life’s mission to help spread God’s grace.
 
 And to all of the moms here today, We celebrate you, and we declare that mothers are heroes.  (Applause.)  That’s true.  Your strength, devotion, and drive is what powers our nation. And, because of you, our country has been blessed with amazing souls who have changed the course of human history.
 
 We cannot know what our citizens yet unborn will achieve, the dreams they will imagine, the masterpieces they will create, the discoveries they will make.  But we know this, Every life brings love into this world.  Every child brings joy to a family.  Every person is worth protecting.  (Applause.)  And above all, we know that every human soul is divine, and every human life –- born and unborn –- is made in the holy image of Almighty God. (Applause.)
 
 Together, we will defend this truth all across our magnificent land.  We will set free the dreams of our people. And with determined hope, we look forward to all of the blessings that will come from the beauty, talent, purpose, nobility, and grace of every American child.
 
 I want to thank you.  This is a very special moment.  It’s so great to represent you.  I love you all and –- (applause) — and I say with true passion,  Thank you. God bless you.  And God bless America.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  (Applause.)"
trump_press_conference.txt,"President: Donald Trump
 
 Thank you very much.  Thank you.
 
 Well, thank you all for being here.  We’ve had a tremendous three days in New York, at the United Nations.  I want to thank the Secretary-General.  It’s been really incredible what’s been taking place.  And he’s been a fantastic host to a lot of countries.
 
 The meetings I had on a bilat, or close, were pretty staggering.  I think we set a new record, but you’ll have to check that out.  The — we met very, very — for pretty extended periods of time, either two and two, one on one, or just about at that level with Pakistan, Poland, New Zealand, Singapore, Egypt, South Korea, United Kingdom, India, Iraq, Argentina, Germany, Brazil, France, Japan, Ukraine, Honduras, El Salvador, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, UAE, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.  Other than that, we weren’t too busy over the last three days.
 
 And, unfortunately, the press doesn’t even cover it.  You know, we have — we’ve made some fantastic deals, like with Japan.  For farmers, we have a tremendous trade deal with Japan.  And that doesn’t get covered because you waste your time on nonsense.
 
 The PMI manufacturers’ index has gone substantially up, which was an incredible — Larry Kudlow, wherever you may be — Larry, please stand up.  He just gave me these numbers.  And existing new home sales are through the roof.  Just came out.  Oil prices have gone down ever since the Saudi Arabia incident, and they’ve gone down very substantially.  So, we have plenty of oil.  But those numbers were surprising to you, Larry.  And the extent of the increase.  Is that a correct statement?  So thank you, Larry Kudlow.
 
 We think we’ll make this little announcement to you because — important.  You know the so-called whistleblower?  The one that didn’t have any first-class, or first-rate, or second-tier information, from what I understand.  You’ll have to figure that out for yourself.  But I’ve spoken with Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans — many of them — and we were going to do this anyway, but I’ve informed them — all of the House members — that I fully support transparency on the so-called whistleblower information, even though it was supposedly second-hand information, which is sort of interesting.
 
 And other things have come out about the whistleblower that are also maybe even more interesting.  But also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China.  Millions of dollars.  Millions and millions of dollars taken out very rapidly while he was Vice President.  And I think they should have transparency for that.  I’ve informed the Leader about that.
 
 And additionally, I demand transparency from Democrats who went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President, who I met and is an outstanding person.  I just met a little while ago; some of you were there.  I think he’s going to be outstanding.  He got elected on the basis of corruption.  He wants to end corruption in Ukraine, and I think that’s great.
 
 But they went there and they wanted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat.  They threatened him if he didn’t do things.  Now, that’s what they’re accusing me of, but I didn’t do it.  I didn’t threaten anybody.  In fact, the press was asking questions of the President of Ukraine.  And he said, “No pressure.”  I used the word “pressure.”  I think he used the word “push,” but he meant pressure, but it’s the same thing.  No push, no pressure, no nothing.  It’s all a hoax, folks.  It’s all a big hoax.
 
 And the sad thing about this hoax is that we work so hard with all of these countries — and I mean really hard.  This has been — I’ve been up from early in the morning to late in the evening, and meeting with different countries all for the good of our country, and the press doesn’t even cover all of this.  And it’s disappearing — it’s really disappointing also to those countries that are with us and spend so much time with us.
 
 So, we want transparency.  We’ve informed Kevin McCarthy about transparency.  And we said, “Vote for it.”  So I think you’ll have close to 100 percent of the Republican votes, I hope.
 
 And it got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Senators Robert Menendez, Richard Durbin, and Patrick Leahy wrote a letter to Ukraine’s Prosecutor General expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were “critical.”  In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn’t do the right thing, they wouldn’t get any assistance.  Gee, doesn’t that sound familiar?  Doesn’t that sound familiar?
 
 And Chris Murphy — who I’ve been dealing with on guns — you know, so nice.  He’s always, “Oh, no, we want to work it out.  We want to work it out.”  But they’re too busy wasting their time on the witch hunt.  So, Senator Chris Murphy literally threatened the President of Ukraine that, if he doesn’t do things right, they won’t have Democrat support in Congress.  So you’re going to look all of this up.
 
 One other thing — I’m just going off of certain notes and elements of what we’ve been doing over the last three days, but this just came up a few minutes ago: The “Amazon-Washington Post” just put out a fake article that Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire — who I’ve gotten to know, and he’s a tough cookie — and I was surprised; I was shocked to hear this — was going to quit, blaming the White House for something that they wouldn’t let him talk openly, freely.  And I was shocked because I know Joe, and he’s tough.  A tough guy.
 
 And I was really surprised to hear he was going to quit.  Before I could even either talk to him or talk to anybody else, he put out a statement — I didn’t speak to Joe yet — but he said, “At no time have I considered resigning my position.”  In other words, the story in the Washington Post was a fake.
 
 “At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on August 16, 2019.  I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now.  I’m committed to leading the intelligence community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.”  That’s from the Acting Director of National Intelligence, a very good man, Joseph Maguire.
 
 So we’re having a great period of time.  Our country is the strongest it’s ever been economically.  Our numbers are phenomenal.  Wilbur, thank you.  And Larry.  Everybody.  The numbers are phenomenal.  Our economy is the strongest in the world.  We’re the largest economy in the world.
 
 Had my opponent won, we would be second right now because China was catching us so rapidly, we would’ve been second by this time.  And unless somebody does a very poor job as President, we’re going to be first for a long way, because we’ve picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in value and worth of our country, and China has lost trillions and trillions of dollars, and millions of jobs, and their supply chain.  And they want to make a deal.
 
 This year, America came to the United Nations stronger than we have ever been before: Since my election, the United States has not only brought our economy to a level that we have never seen, the most jobs that we’ve ever had — you know you’ve heard me say it many times — African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, the best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had.  And the most and best employment numbers: 160 million — very close to that number — in jobs.  We’ve never been anywhere close.
 
 Wages are up, and inequality is down.  Something that people don’t like writing about.  But wages are up.  I used to speak during the campaign, and I’d talk about wages where people were making less money three years ago than they were making 21 years, 22 years ago, and they’d have two jobs and three jobs.  When I say “three years ago,” I’m talking into the area sometime prior to the election.  And they were doing very badly.  And now, for the first time in many years, wages are up and employment is up, and unemployment is down.  And it’s a beautiful thing to watch.
 
 In a week of active and ambitious diplomacy here at the United Nations, America renewed our friendships.  We advanced our values greatly and made clear to everyone that the United States will always defend our citizens to promote prosperity.
 
 I met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at length, of the United Kingdom, continuing our discussions on a magnificent, new bilateral trade deal.  So we’ll see what happens with respect to Brexit, but I suspect we’ll have a fantastic deal with the UK. It should be much bigger than it has been over the last number of years.  Over the last 20 years, frankly.  It should be a much bigger deal.
 
 That’s true with many countries.  We’re going to have much bigger trade deals with a lot of countries that have an opportunity to come.  And they all want to do business with the United States, especially now.
 
 Earlier today, I stood alongside Prime Minister Abe of Japan — a friend of mine, a great gentleman.  Had a great reelection.  And we signed a terrific new trade deal, which tremendously helps our farmers and ranchers, and technology.  The technology companies are really big beneficiaries.
 
 We also held very productive conversations with leaders of Pakistan, India.  And many other nations are achieving stronger ties of fair and reciprocal trade.  And with respect to Pakistan and India, we talked about Kashmir.  And whatever help I can be, I said — I offered, whether it’s arbitration or mediation, or whatever it has to be, I’ll do whatever I can.  Because they’re at very serious odds right now, and hopefully that’ll get better.
 
 You look at the two gentlemen heading those two countries — two good friends of mine — I said, “Fellas, work it out.  Just work it out.”  Those are two nuclear countries.  They’ve got to work it out.
 
 This week, we also made incredible strides on national security with President Duda of Poland.  We signed a joint declaration advancing defense cooperation.  And, crucially, Poland has agreed to put up 100 percent of the money — something I don’t think you’ve ever heard said before.  But they’re going to put up 100 percent of the money, of hosting additional U.S. military personnel that we’ll be taking from various other countries.  We won’t have more over; we’ll have — we’ll be moving them around.
 
 Poland is building us phenomenal new facilities.  They’re spending everything, and they’re going to really do a job.  But we’ll be moving a few thousand soldiers, and Poland will be paying that for it.
 
 Together with Prime Minister Lee of Singapore, I signed an important agreement extending our defense cooperation.  This hasn’t been changed in many years.  Then, yesterday, I met with prospective members of the Middle East Strategic Alliance, which is a group that I know very well; I know all of them.  And through this effort, the nations of the Middle East are taking more responsibility for securing their own future and their own neighborhood.  And they’re also reimbursing us and paying us for a lot of the military work that we incredibly do.
 
 But because we’re now independent, energy-wise — we’re energy independent — we have very few boats going over the Middle East.  We used to have them going through the Straits all the time.  And you probably noticed that, every once in a while, they go after somebody else’s.  They haven’t gone after ours yet. If they do, they’ve get big problems.  But we have very few boats going over there.  They were saying the other day, they’ve never attacked an American boat, and I’m not asking for trouble.  But if they do, they know they have far bigger trouble.  But then they said, “But, you know, we don’t see very many American boats over here anymore.”
 
 This week also brought extraordinary progress to nations of our own hemisphere.  In recent days, we’ve achieved historic asylum cooperation agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  We were with El Salvador today.  A great young gentleman became the President.  He’s strong and tough, and he’s taking care of crime.  He was really something today.  I was very impressed with him.  And likewise with Honduras, who we met.  We signed a cooperation agreement with both, and also with Guatemala.
 
 We’re working with our partners in Central America to ensure that asylum-seekers can pursue relief as close to their home countries as possible.  That’ll make a tremendous difference at our southern border.
 
 And Mexico — I have to say, President Lopez Obrador has been outstanding — an outstanding partner.  And he’s doing a great job in Mexico.  The cartels are way down, and the numbers — our Secretary is here now — the numbers are way down.  Way, way down.  And we’re doing that without the help of Congress, meaning the Democrats in Congress who won’t give us a single vote to take care of loopholes.
 
 We have loopholes that are so horrible, and it would be so easy to fix.  And they know they should be fixed but they don’t want to do because they don’t want to give Trump any credit because it’s all about the election.  That’s all they care about.  They don’t care about our country; they care about the election.
 
 And the sad part is, with all of the tremendous work that we’ve done this weekend — whether it’s Secretary Mnuchin or Secretary Pompeo, who had some outstanding, outstanding meetings — with all of this tremendous work that we’ve done, the press doesn’t even cover it.  And the Democrats did this hoax during the United Nations week.  It was perfect.  Because this way, it takes away from these tremendous achievements that we’re taking care of doing, that we’re involved in in New York City, at the United Nations.
 
 So that was all planned, like everything else.  It was all planned.  And the witch hunt continues, but they’re getting hit hard in this witch hunt, because when they look at the information, it’s a joke.  Impeachment?  For that?  When you have a wonderful meeting, or you have a wonderful phone conversation?
 
 I think you should ask.  We actually — you know, that was the second conversation.  I think you should ask for the first conversation also.  I can’t believe they haven’t, although I heard there’s a — there’s a rumor out they want the first conversation.  It was beautiful.  It was just a perfect conversation.
 
 But I think you should do that.  I think you should do, and I think you should ask for VP Pence’s conversation because he had a couple conversations also.  I can save you a lot of time.  They’re all perfect.  Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations.  But the word is that they’re going to ask for the first phone conversation.  You can have it anytime you need it.  And also Mike Pence’s conversations, which were, I think, one or two of them.  They were perfect.  They were all perfect.
 
 It’s very sad what the Democrats are doing to this country. They’re dividing.  They’re belittling.  They’re demeaning our country.  So many leaders came up to me today and they said, “Sir, what you go through, no President has ever gone through.  And it’s so bad for your country.”  People laugh at the stupidity of what they’ve asked for.  And here we could do asylum.  We could do all of these different things so easily.  We could do asylum quickly.  We could do loopholes; get rid of them.
 
 Instead, we actually made deals with Mexico and with Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras.  And we’re doing it with them instead of with our Congress, but we’re doing it.  We get it done.
 
 The wall is being built, by the way.  It got little coverage.  I went to the border.  It’s going up in New Mexico.  It’s going up in Arizona.  It’s going up in California, believe it or not.  They really wanted that wall in California, in San Diego.  As soon as it was completed, they said, “We don’t want a wall.”  They were begging me for a wall.  I should take it out and move it to another location.
 
 We were with the Governor — spoke to him a lot — but the Governor of Texas, Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Attorney General of Texas, the senators of Texas — Cornyn, Ted Cruz.  And we’re building an incredible wall.  That’s going to — number one, it’s going to look great.  It’s going to be virtually impossible to cross unless you’re one hell of a mountain climber.  It’s very tough.  It’s going to be very tough to get people and drugs over those walls, because they’re the real deal.
 
 I went to the Secretary of Homeland security, and he got all his people together.  I said, “Give me four walls — your optimum.  Every single thing included.”  And they give me 20 percent less, 20 percent less, and 20 percent less — meaning, less cost.  They came back, they said, “This is the wall, sir.  This would be the best.”  We have the panels on top, which are anti-climb panels.  I don’t know if you noticed the steel on top.  We have a different design for a different area, but this anti-climb is very tough.  They’ve — we had people going out and real climbers telling us which is the toughest to climb.  But these are anti-climb panels.  Very tough to get across.
 
 And the wall is going up, many miles a week.  And we hope to have over 400, but maybe as much as 500 miles, which we’ll pretty much do it because you have a lot of natural barriers; you have mountains, you have really rough rivers.  You have some really rough land that you can’t cross very easily.  So they serve as their natural walls.  But we — we’ll have, we think, over 400, but we could even have 500 miles.
 
 To combat the malice, corruption of both the Venezuelan and Iranian dictatorships, today I issued proclamations suspending the entry into the United States of senior regime officials and their families.
 
 And further, to promote American values, on Monday I was proud to be the first President in history to host a meeting at the United Nations —
 
 I’m so surprised; first President for this.  I can’t believe that I’m first.  I spoke to Franklin Graham about that.  I can’t believe it.
 
 — at the United Nations, on protecting religious freedom and liberty for people around the world.
 
 While some partisans and unelected bureaucrats in Washington may choose to fight every day against the interests and beliefs of the American people, my administration is standing up for the American people like no administration has in many, many years.  You forgot the American people.  You totally forgot the American people.
 
 This week, every — every week, I really can say — of my presidency, we’re standing up for American prosperity, American security, and the American way of life.  And together, with our friends and partners, we’re building a more peaceful, prosperous, and promising future.
 
 We have a tremendous relationship now with a lot of nations that are very happy with what’s going on, and that includes in South America, where they’ve been so helpful, where nobody thought this would be possible.  The relationship with Mexico is an example, or El Salvador, or Honduras, or Guatemala.  Nobody even knew about it.  Yet, we sent them hundreds of millions of dollars, and all we got back was caravans of people pouring in.
 
 We had tremendous — we had tremendous — it was terrible.  And we’ve got that stopped, and the countries are now helping us.  And we stopped those payments, by the way.  We don’t pay those countries that money anymore.  But I will tell you, if they’re as good as they seem to be — they’re really doing a job on crime and stopping the wrong people from leaving and coming to the United States — we’ll be helping them a lot with economic development projects and other things.
 
 So, with that, we had a tremendous three days.  It was beautiful to see.  Made a lot of new friends.  I read you a list of all the countries I saw pretty much one on one.  And it’s been very busy, but it’s been very, very fruitful.
 
 So we could take a couple of questions. I’d love some questions on some of the things that we accomplished at UNGA, instead of the witch hunt — the phony witch hunt questions, which I know that’s what you want to ask because it’s probably better for you, but it’s not better for the country.
 
 So maybe we’ll take a few — a few questions.  Please."

 Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
 
 Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States—(applause)—and my fellow citizens,
 
 Three years ago, we launched the great American comeback. Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again. (Applause.) America’s enemies are on the run, America’s fortunes are on the rise, and America’s future is blazing bright.
 
 The years of economic decay are over. (Applause.) The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. (Applause.) Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.
 
 In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America’s destiny. We have totally rejected the downsizing. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back. (Applause.)
 
 I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world—and it’s not even close. Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored. And for all of these reasons, I say to the people of our great country and to the members of Congress, The state of our Union is stronger than ever before. (Applause.)
 
 The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world’s most prosperous and inclusive society—one where every citizen can join in America’s unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America’s extraordinary rise.
 
 From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the U.S. economy—slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. (Applause.) Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American. (Applause.) Thank you. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed very, very high.
 
 Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs—5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration. (Applause.)
 
 The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century. (Applause.) And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. (Applause.) True. If we hadn’t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success. (Applause.)
 
 The unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history. (Applause.) African American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low. (Applause.) African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded. (Applause.)
 
 The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years. And, last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added. (Applause.)
 
 The veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low. (Applause.) The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low. (Applause.)
 
 Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in U.S. history. (Applause.) A record number of young Americans are now employed. (Applause.)
 
 Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare. (Applause.)
 
 In eight years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce. In just three years of my administration, 3.5 million people—working-age people—have joined the workforce. (Applause.)
 
 Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent—three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. (Applause.) After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast—and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay increase since my election. (Applause.) This is a blue-collar boom. (Applause.)
 
 Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded. (Applause.)
 
 Since my election, U.S. stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our nation’s wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible. This is a record. It is something that every country in the world is looking up to. They admire. (Applause.) Consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs.
 
 All of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent, and even more.
 
 Jobs and investments are pouring into 9,000 previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts. (Applause.) In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven’t seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement. (Applause.) This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It’s all working.
 
 Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family. He was homeless. But then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones. He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight. Tony, keep up the great work. Tony. (Applause.) Thank you, Tony.
 
 Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law. Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn’t be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done. (Applause.)
 
 Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far. (Applause.) With the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many other elements of our country, are at a record high. (Applause.) We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago.
 
 Likewise, we are restoring our nation’s manufacturing might, even though predictions were, as you all know, that this could never, ever be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration, with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built. (Applause.) Companies are not leaving; they are coming back to the USA. (Applause.) The fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is. (Applause.)
 
 One of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. (Applause.) In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President. Following NAFTA’s adoption, our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do so, and then absolutely nothing happened. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. We did our job. (Applause.)
 
 Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. (Applause.) It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level, but also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity. We will have that, fairness and reciprocity. And I say that, finally, because it’s been many, many years that we were treated fairly on trade. (Applause.)
 
 This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America’s labor unions. (Applause.)
 
 I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China’s massive theft of America’s jobs. Our strategy has worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions and billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the USA. (Applause.)
 
 For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States. Now we have changed that, but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we’ve ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we’ve done because, quite frankly, they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying, “That’s enough.” (Applause.) Now we want to rebuild our country, and that’s exactly what we’re doing. We are rebuilding our country.
 
 As we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. (Applause.) That’s why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba. (Applause.)
 
 We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. (Applause.) Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro’s grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken.
 
 Here this evening is a very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the Gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. (Applause.) Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland. (Applause.) Thank you, Mr. President. Great honor. Thank you very much.
 
 Please take this message back that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom. Thank you very much, Mr. President. (Applause.) Thank you very much.
 
 Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, Freedom unifies the soul. (Applause.)
 
 To safeguard American liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States military. (Applause.) We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment, and it’s all made right here in the USA. (Applause.)
 
 We are also getting our allies, finally, to help pay their fair share. (Applause.) I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of Allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled.
 
 And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a brand-new branch of the United States Armed Forces. It’s called the Space Force. (Applause.) Very important.
 
 In the Gallery tonight, we have a young gentleman. And what he wants so badly—13 years old—Iain Lanphier. He’s an eighth grader from Arizona. Iain, please stand up.
 
 Iain has always dreamed of going to space. He was the first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then he has his eye on the Space Force. As Iain says, “Most people look up at space. I want to look down on the world.” (Laughter and applause.)
 
 But sitting behind Iain tonight is his greatest hero of them all. Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen—the first black fighter pilots—and he also happens to be Iain’s great-grandfather. (Applause.) Incredible story.
 
 After more than 130 combat missions in World War Two, he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. (Applause.) A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee, our nation salutes you. Thank you, sir. (Applause.)
 
 From the pilgrims to the Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King, Americans have always rejected limits on our children’s future.
 
 Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people. (Applause.) The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first. (Applause.)
 
 The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students, 18 states have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list.
 
 One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah. (Applause.) Janiyah’s mom, Stephanie, is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania’s governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children.
 
 Janiyah and Stephanie are in the Gallery. Stephanie, thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter. Thank you very much. (Applause.)
 
 But, Janiyah, I have some good news for you, because I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over. I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship has become available, it’s going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice. (Applause.)
 
 Now I call on Congress to give one million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received. Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunities Act—because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school. (Applause.)
 
 Every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow. For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the BE BEST initiative to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation—online, in school, and in our communities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America’s children. Thank you very much. (Applause.)
 
 My administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background. Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans.
 
 My budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation’s high schools. Tonight, I ask Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America. (Applause.)
 
 To expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation’s historically black colleges and universities. (Applause.)
 
 A good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth. Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive—and better. (Applause.)
 
 I’ve also made an ironclad pledge to American families, We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. (Applause). And we will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security. Always. (Applause.)
 
 The American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills. That is why I signed an executive order requiring price transparency. (Applause.) Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform. (Applause.) It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care.
 
 But as we work to improve Americans’ healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely.
 
 AUDIENCE, Booo
 
 THE PRESIDENT, One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know, We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare. (Applause.)
 
 Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors and that our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. That is what is happening in California and other states. Their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money.
 
 If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government healthcare for illegal aliens. (Applause.)
 
 This will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built. (Applause.) We have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time. Early next year, we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed.
 
 My administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before. (Applause.) And I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down. (Applause.)
 
 And working together, Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I’ve been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done quickly and properly. I’m calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill on my desk, and I will sign it into law immediately. (Applause.)
 
 AUDIENCE, H.R.3! H.R.3! H.R.3!
 
 With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. (Applause.) Among the states hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent—and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all. (Applause.)
 
 Protecting Americans’ health also means fighting infectious diseases. We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China. My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.
 
 We have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer’s, and those struggling with mental health. And because Congress was so good as to fund my request, new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of this decade. (Applause.)
 
 Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness. Here tonight is a special man, beloved by millions of Americans who just received a Stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis. This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet. Rush Limbaugh, thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country. (Applause.)
 
 And, Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. (Applause.)
 
 I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to present you with the honor. Please. (Applause.)
 
 (The Medal of Freedom is presented.) (Applause.)
 
 Rush and Kathryn, congratulations. Thank you, Kathryn.
 
 As we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs. In 2017, doctors at St. Luke’s Hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive. Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was a born fighter. Through the skill of her doctors and the prayers of her parents, little Ellie kept on winning the battle of life. Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy two-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the Gallery. Ellie and Robin, we are glad to have you with us tonight. (Applause.)
 
 Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life. And thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive. It’s an incredible thing. Thank you very much. (Applause.)
 
 Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is why I’m asking Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neonatal research for America’s youngest patients. (Applause.)
 
 That is why I’m also calling upon members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies. (Applause.) Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God.
 
 As we support America’s moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country. (Applause.)
 
 Now I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across our nation. (Applause.)
 
 Forty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit. (Applause.) I’ve also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 states to help more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether. (Applause.) And I sent Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality child care, and urge you to act immediately. (Applause.)
 
 To protect the environment, days ago I announced that the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world. (Applause.)
 
 We must also rebuild America’s infrastructure. (Applause.) I ask you to pass Senator John Barrasso’s highway bill to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels all across our land.
 
 I’m also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed Internet, including and especially in rural America. (Applause.)
 
 A better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe. That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our nation’s heroic ICE officers. (Applause.)
 
 Last year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders.
 
 Tragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens.
 
 AUDIENCE, Booo
 
 THE PRESIDENT, In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.
 
 Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman. The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York’s sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had honored ICE’s detainer request, his victim would still be alive today.
 
 The state of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants—a very terrible sanctuary—with catastrophic results.
 
 Here is just one tragic example. In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault. But as required by California’s Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him.
 
 Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work. He approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and in the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims. One of the victims is—a terrible, terrible situation; died—51-year-old American named Rocky Jones.
 
 Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood. Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers, who loved him more than anything else in the world. One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight. Jody, would you please stand? Jody, thank you. (Applause.) Jody our hearts weep for your loss, and we will not rest until you have justice.
 
 Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly practices. (Applause.)
 
 I ask Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. (Applause.)
 
 In the last three years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers. And I have signed nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and all around the globe. My administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States. (Applause.)
 
 Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again. My administration has ended catch and release. (Applause.) If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed from our country. (Applause.)
 
 Very importantly, we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May, dropping eight straight months in a row. (Applause.) And as the wall rapidly goes up, drug seizures rise, and the border crossings are down, and going down very rapidly.
 
 Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol, and he joins us tonight. Chief Ortiz, please stand. (Applause.) A grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of Border Patrol and ICE. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)
 
 To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values. (Applause.)
 
 With every action, my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom. (Applause.) Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell—thank you, Mitch—and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written. This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Thank you. (Applause.) And we have many in the pipeline. (Laughter and applause.)
 
 My administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools. (Applause.) In America, we don’t punish prayer. We don’t tear down crosses. We don’t ban symbols of faith. We don’t muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith, we cherish religion, we lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God.
 
 Just as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country. So long as I am President, I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.)
 
 In reaffirming our heritage as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation. Now we must embrace the next frontier, America’s manifest destiny in the stars. I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the Moon will be American astronauts using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars. (Applause.)
 
 My administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism. (Applause.)
 
 Last week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future.
 
 Three years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS—the bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi—is dead. (Applause.)
 
 We are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller. After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker. She once wrote, “Some people find God in church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God in love. I find God in suffering. I’ve known for some time what my life’s work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering.” In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of al-Baghdadi himself. After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, al-Baghdadi murdered young, beautiful Kayla. She was just 26 years old.
 
 On the night that U.S. Special Forces Operations ended al-Baghdadi’s miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room. He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name, “Task Force 8-14.” It was a reference to a special day, August 14th—Kayla’s birthday. Carl and Marsha, America’s warriors never forgot Kayla—and neither will we. Thank you. (Applause.)
 
 Every day, America’s men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depth of love that dwells in the human heart.
 
 One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake. On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his one-year-old son, Gage, “I will be with you again,” he wrote to Gage. “I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports, and see you have kids also. I love you son. Take care of your mother. I am always with you. Daddy.”
 
 On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the Gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now a 13-year-old and doing very, very well. To Kelli and Gage, Chris will live in our hearts forever. He is looking down on you now. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you both very much.
 
 The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris’s life. Soleimani was the Iranian regime’s most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. As the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children. He directed the December assault and went on to assault U.S. forces in Iraq. Was actively planning new attacks when we hit him very hard. And that’s why, last month, at my direction, the U.S. military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever. (Applause.)
 
 Our message to the terrorists is clear, You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life. (Applause.)
 
 In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons; stop spreading terror, death, and destruction; and start working for the good of its own people.
 
 Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very, very poorly. We can help them make a very good and short-time recovery. It can all go very quickly, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let’s see which road they choose. It is totally up to them. (Applause.)
 
 As we defend American lives, we are working to end America’s wars in the Middle East.
 
 In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are now underway. I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them totally innocent. It is also not our function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies. These are warfighters that we have—the best in the world—and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. We are working to finally end America’s longest war and bring our troops back home. (Applause.)
 
 War places a heavy burden on our nation’s extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her two children—six-year-old Elliana and three-year-old Rowan. Amy works full-time and volunteers countless hours helping other military families. For the past seven months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment in the Middle East. Amy’s kids haven’t seen their father’s face in many months. Amy, your family’s sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and in peace, and we want to thank you. Thank you, Amy. (Applause.)
 
 But, Amy, there is one more thing. Tonight, we have a very special surprise. I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment. He is here with us tonight, and we couldn’t keep him waiting any longer. (Applause.)
 
 AUDIENCE, USA! USA! USA!
 
 THE PRESIDENT, Welcome home, Sergeant Williams. Thank you very much.
 
 As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. This is a place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great generals including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo—(applause)—the beautiful, beautiful Alamo.
 
 The American nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk on the face of the Earth. Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out the canals, raised up the skyscrapers. And, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional republic ever to exist in all of human history, and we are making it greater than ever before. (Applause.)
 
 This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance. We are Americans. We are pioneers. We are the pathfinders. We settled the New World, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God. (Applause.)
 
 America is the place where anything can happen. America is the place where anyone can rise. And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true.
 
 This nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored. Our brightest discoveries are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories are not yet told. Our grandest journeys are not yet made. The American Age, the American Epic, the American adventure has only just begun.
 
 Our spirit is still young, the sun is still rising, God’s grace is still shining, and, my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come. (Applause.)
 
 Thank you. God Bless You. And God Bless America. Thank you very much. (Applause.)"
